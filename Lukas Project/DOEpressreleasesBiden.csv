The grants are being provided under the Postsecondary Student Success Grant (PSSG) program, which aims to equitably improve postsecondary student outcomes, including retention, transfer, credit accumulation, and completion, by leveraging data and implementing, scaling, and rigorously evaluating evidence-based approaches. “Across the country, colleges and universities are rejecting the old idea that weeding out students was a sign of quality, and instead they are taking responsibility for all of their students’ success,” said U.S. Under Secretary of Education James Kvaal. “These awards will not only help find new ways to help students graduate; they will help change expectations.” Only 62% of students graduate within six years, including fewer than half of Black students, according to the most recent data from the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center. However, the national rate has grown by 7 percentage points over the past decade, indicating that new approaches are helping hundreds of thousands more students earn college degrees. Seven grantees are receiving awards through PSSG to fund evidence-based strategies that result in improved outcomes for underserved students. The funding is being awarded to three grantees that are in the early phase and four grantees in the mid-phase/expansion phase, based upon the amount of existing research validating their effectiveness in improving student postsecondary education outcomes. The Department also published the final rule for the Postsecondary Student Success Grant program. The rulemaking sets up priorities, requirements, definitions and selection criterion that could be used in future competitions for this funding. The Final Rule sets three tiers of evidence standards that can be used – from Demonstrates a Rationale/Promising to Moderate to Strong – to ensure that grantees’ projects are based on evidence and designed and implemented to have an impact on increasing student completion. There is also a priority that aligns with the Department’s recognition of the important role college-to-career pathways and supports play in student success. The rule requires grantees to submit an independent evaluation of the effectiveness of their project and targets the funds to the most under-resourced institutions by focusing eligibility on Title III and V institutions, or non-profits or states in partnership with such institutions. Finally, the rule sets a new selection criterion measuring the extent to which proposed projects use data for continuous improvement of student outcomes for underserved students. A list of grantees can be found below: Grantee Amount of Grant State Description California State University, Fresno Foundation $7,959,963 CA Proposes to develop and deliver an enhanced advising project, which will impact retention and completion. Center for Collaborative Education $8,000,000 MA Proposes to work collaboratively with 5 community colleges to strategically address student success in teacher preparation programs by focusing on enhanced advisory mentoring with financial supports. New York Institute of Technology $2,763,820 NY Proposes to supplement and enhance its existing advising and student success infrastructure for second and third-year underserved students with the ultimate goal of increasing persistence and graduation. Research Foundation for The Suny - Albany $3,998,852 NY Proposes to provide personalized financial coaching that aligns with the student success infrastructure to position its diverse student population to thrive, persist, and graduate. Portland State University (PSU) $7,823,199 OR Proposes facilitating the transfer pathway between two feeder colleges and PSU by providing early/proactive, wrap-around guidance and the removal of financial barriers to transfer students. Jarvis Christian University $3,418,794 TX Proposes to serve under-resourced and underperforming currently enrolled students to ensure reenrollment, progression, completion, and employment. The University of Texas at San Antonio $7,299,868 TX Proposes to refine and scale coaching, develop guided learning pathways and utilize system-level financial incentives to support first generation students.

14-Aug-24,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/statement-form-us-secretary-education-miguel-cardona-supreme-court-filing-saving-valuable-education-save-plan,Statement from U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona on Supreme Court Filing on the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) Plan,"Statement from U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona: Yesterday, the U.S. Department of Justice filed an emergency application with the Supreme Court to vacate the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals’ injunction of the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) Plan. This injunction, if allowed to stand, would harm borrowers who have dutifully repaid their loans for up to 25 years by denying forgiveness that has been available under law for three decades. We remain committed to supporting borrowers and fighting for the most affordable repayment options possible for millions of people across the country. Already, we’ve approved $169 billion in relief for nearly 4.8 million Americans entitled to relief under various programs, including teachers, veterans, and other public servants; students who were cheated by their colleges; borrowers with disabilities; and more. President Biden, Vice President Harris, and I are committed to fighting for college affordability for all."
12-Aug-24,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/statement-us-secretary-education-miguel-cardona-8th-circuit-court-ruling-biden-harris-administrations-saving-valuable-education-save-plan,Statement from U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona on the 8th Circuit Court Ruling on Biden-Harris Administration’s Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) Plan,"“The Administration strongly disagrees with the Eighth Circuit’s decision blocking the Biden Administration’s SAVE plan. If allowed to stand, this ruling would force millions of borrowers to pay hundreds of dollars more each month. And the decision’s reasoning could also deny loan forgiveness to individuals who were expecting it after up to 25 years of faithful repayments. The ruling rejects a practice of providing loan forgiveness that goes back 30 years. “It’s shameful that politically motivated lawsuits waged by Republican elected officials are once again standing in the way of lower payments for millions of borrowers. “Borrowers enrolled in the SAVE Plan will be placed in an interest-free forbearance while our Administration continues to vigorously defend the SAVE Plan in court. The Department will be providing regular updates to borrowers affected by these rulings in the coming days. “It wasn’t so long ago that a million borrowers defaulted on their student loans every single year, mainly because they couldn’t afford the payments. The SAVE plan is a clearly authorized and urgently needed effort to fix what’s broken in our student loan system and make financing a higher education more affordable in this country. The Biden-Harris Administration remains committed to delivering as much relief as possible for as many borrowers as possible. Already, we’ve approved $169 billion in relief for nearly 4.8 million Americans, including teachers, veterans, and other public servants, students who were cheated by their colleges, borrowers with disabilities, and more. And from larger Pell Grants to free community college, President Biden, Vice President Harris, and I continue to believe that college affordability is a cause worth fighting for – and we’re not giving up.”"
9-Aug-24,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-educations-office-civil-rights-announces-resolution-sexual-harassment-compliance-review-san-diego-unified-school-district,U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights Announces Resolution of Sexual Harassment Compliance Review of San Diego Unified School District,"The U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) today announced that the San Diego Unified School District in California entered into a resolution agreement to remedy violations OCR found of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. The agreement also resolves a concern that OCR identified about the district’s fulfillment of its obligations under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504) and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (Title II). After examining 253 reports and complaints of sexual harassment of students over three school years, OCR found that the district more often than not did not fulfill its Title IX regulatory requirement to equitably respond to allegations of sexual harassment of its students. These failures led to serial perpetration of harassment with insufficient district response, leaving district students vulnerable to the sex discrimination in school that Title IX forbids. In addition, the district failed to evaluate whether allegations of sexual harassment, including sexual assault, violated Title IX and caused discrimination on the basis of sex for affected students; failed to redress effects of confirmed sexual harassment on affected students; and failed to provide notice of outcomes of investigations on an equitable basis to all parties. While evaluating the district’s responses to sexual harassment under Title IX, OCR identified a concern that the district may have denied students a free appropriate public education (FAPE) in violation of Section 504 and Title II. OCR learned that the district received notice regarding students with disabilities who were alleged perpetrators as well as targeted students, and that district files included information about escalating disability-based behaviors that caused sexual harassment and about students with disabilities who repeatedly perpetrated, or were victims of, sexual harassment. These case files included no information showing the district’s fulfillment of its Section 504 and Title II obligations to: (1) evaluate students whose behaviors indicated a reason to suspect a disability, (2) reevaluate students with disabilities when it has notice that their existing supports and accommodations may not be effective to serve their disability-based needs, or (3) evaluate the impact on students’ receipt of a FAPE when students with disabilities have been subjected to harassment. OCR notes that during the course of this compliance review, the district has developed a new office of compliance and hired additional staff to support its Title IX compliance work. The district commitments to resolve this compliance review include: Conducting a review of previous incidents or reported student-to-student and employee-to-student sexual harassment to determine whether further action is needed to provide an equitable resolution of the incidents and to ensure nondiscrimination with respect to students with disabilities; Providing annual age-appropriate training to all students in grades 3-12 about how to recognize and report sexual harassment and receive supportive measures and remedies; Administering annual climate surveys of parents, students, and district employees with respect to sexual harassment in district schools; Ensuring its policies prohibiting sex discrimination, including sexual harassment, and its Title IX grievance procedures comply with Title IX; Annually training district employees on their Title IX obligations to respond to reports and complaints of sex discrimination, including sexual harassment, as well as their Section 504 and Title II obligations for students with disabilities; Implementing an OCR-approved system and policy for maintenance of data and records related to reports, complaints, and investigations of sexual harassment; and, Ensuring the district fulfills its Title IX obligations when law enforcement is involved in responding to sexual harassment of students. “Through today’s resolution, San Diego Unified commits to overhaul its response to allegations of sexual harassment to ensure all its students learn safely and without sex or disability discrimination,” said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon. “OCR looks forward to working with the district to redress serial perpetration, protect students with disabilities from being preyed upon, and ensure that district students can expect to focus on learning without unlawful sexual harassment.” The letter of resolution and the resolution agreement are available on OCR’s website ."
8-Aug-24,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-educations-office-civil-rights-announces-resolution-title-ix-athletics-investigation-minneapolis-public-school-district,U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights Announces Resolution of Title IX Athletics Investigation of Minneapolis Public School District,"The U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) today announced that the Minneapolis Public School District in Minnesota has entered into an agreement to ensure compliance with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 with respect to the district-wide athletics programs at its high schools. OCR investigated whether the district failed to effectively accommodate the interests and abilities of female students in its interscholastic athletics program and whether it provided equal opportunity in the provision of competitive and practice facilities and locker rooms to its female athletes. OCR’s investigation revealed disparities between the female enrollment rate and their interscholastic athletics participation rate at several district high schools and overall. Despite these disparities, the district acknowledged that it has not completed a student athletic interest survey in the past ten years. The district also confirmed that it does not have written policies, procedures, or criteria for the addition of sports and/or levels to the interscholastic athletics program. OCR also identified disparities in the district’s provision of practice and competitive facilities and locker rooms. OCR’s investigation revealed that some girls teams have inferior practice and competition facilities compared to the boys teams. For instance, overwhelmingly, the various softball facilities used by the district’s softball teams are not regulation for fast pitch softball, lack adequate fencing, and lack amenities, while the district boys baseball teams generally practice and compete at higher quality baseball fields with better amenities that are regulation for competition. Furthermore, OCR’s investigation found that the girls softball teams are regularly displaced from competitive events because their facility was not available to them after 6 p.m. due to the recreational adult men’s softball leagues using the facility at that time, which prevented the girls teams from completing their competitions. In terms of maintenance and preparation of the practice and competitive facilities, OCR’s investigation raised concerns that a higher proportion of female athletes have preparation responsibilities for their sports practices and competitive events. For example, several girls volleyball teams are responsible for setting up their nets for practices, competitions, or both, and several girls badminton teams reported responsibility for setting up their nets for practices and competitions, as well as seating at their competitive events. Additionally, the girls softball teams at two high schools have to set up outfield fencing because their facility lacks fencing. OCR’s investigation also raised concerns that female student athletes at several high schools are not provided equivalent access to quality locker rooms. For example, female athletes at two high schools reported their locker rooms lacked hot water and OCR observed that the female locker rooms at one high school were poorly maintained. Additionally, the male athletes at one school have an additional separate locker room for exclusive use by the male athletic participants and the male football participants at another school had an additional locker room at the stadium for their use, with no offsetting benefit to female participants. Female athletes at multiple schools also reported that their locker rooms are locked during the day, whereas the boys locker rooms are open and available to them. “Minneapolis Public Schools has signed a robust agreement to assure that female students at each of its high schools will now have the equal opportunity to participate in sports and equal access to facilities for competition, practice and locker rooms that Title IX guarantees,” said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon. The resolution agreement commits the district to: Conduct a full assessment of how the district can equally and effectively accommodate athletic interest and abilities to provide equal opportunities for female students in its high school athletics program. Develop a plan, with timeframes, to increase participation opportunities for female students as necessary to demonstrate compliance with Title IX. Create a Stakeholder Committee to work collaboratively with the district to create district-wide policies and procedures for the interscholastic athletics program including grievance procedures, and on other Title IX compliance issues. Assess and develop a plan with respect to the provision of locker rooms, practice and competitive facilities at each high school in the district. Equally and effectively accommodate the athletic interest and ability of all students by providing equal opportunities in the provision of locker rooms, practice, and competitive facilities. Training its Title IX coordinators, athletic directors, principals, and coaches on their responsibilities under Title IX and its application to athletics, including how funding from any source can affect the balance of equivalent benefits for male and female athletes. The letter of resolution and the resolution agreement are available on the OCR website ."

7-Aug-24,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-announces-schedule-and-new-process-launch-2025-26-fafsa-form,U.S. Department of Education Announces Schedule and New Process to Launch 2025-26 FAFSA Form,"The U.S. Department of Education (Department) today announced that the 2025-26 Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA® form) will be launched through a new process. Starting on October 1, the Department will release the 2025-26 FAFSA form for testing with a limited set of students and institutions. The Department will make the application available to all students on or before December 1. This process is informed by conversations and feedback from thousands of students, institutions, and other stakeholders. The Department will invite volunteers to participate in the testing period, and over time will make the form available to an increasing number of participants, starting with hundreds and expanding to tens of thousands of applicants. This process will allow the Department to test and resolve issues before making the form available to all students and contributors. Using this approach, the Department will launch full functionality, including submission and back-end processing at the same time. “Following a challenging 2024-25 FAFSA cycle, the Department listened carefully to the input of students, families, and higher education institutions, made substantial changes to leadership and operations at Federal Student Aid, and is taking a new approach this year that will significantly improve the FAFSA experience,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “Thanks to the partnership of our stakeholders, we’ve developed a better implementation process for 2025-26. I look forward to continuing to work with our partners to ensure this school year’s FAFSA implementation better serves our nation’s students.” The goal of the phased rollout of the 2025-26 FAFSA form, consistent with software industry best-practices, is to work with limited groups of users to identify and resolve the kind of system errors that can derail millions of students and contributors and thousands of colleges. A phased rollout will also allow the Department to incorporate user feedback to ensure the application’s instructions are clear and easy-to-use for students and contributors and provide resources for the community that supports students and families. Thanks to investments through the FAFSA Student Support Strategy and the partnership of community and stakeholders, student application success rates have significantly increased over the past six months, with the submission gap from the prior year falling from roughly 40% in March to under 4%, as of today. ""We've heard from students, families, higher education professionals and other stakeholders loud and clear: They want a better, simpler FAFSA process, and they want to know when they can reliably expect it,"" said FAFSA Executive Advisor Jeremy Singer. ""In close collaboration with partners, FSA is confident we will deliver not only a better product, but also a smoother process than last year. One that makes higher education more accessible and within reach for more Americans."" Throughout the testing period, the Department will share regular updates with students, families and a broad range of community stakeholders to make sure they clearly understand our progress. This will also boost confidence among students and families, institutions, state agencies, and other partners and stakeholders. Moreover, the Department will continue to seek feedback from our partners through August listening sessions and a new formal request for information that will be released next week. The Department will publish more about what it has learned through these engagements, including releasing a new roadmap with additional tools for students and families, counselors, institutions and other partners planning for a successful 2025-26 FAFSA season. In the coming weeks, the Department will release more information about how this testing period will work. Our top priority is ensuring students have access to the maximum federal financial aid possible to reach their education goals, and we are working tirelessly to ensure students and our partners have a smooth experience with the 2025-26 FAFSA form."
2-Aug-24,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-educations-office-civil-rights-announces-resolution-complaint-against-drexel-university-alleging-antisemitic-discrimination,U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights Announces Resolution of Complaint Against Drexel University Alleging Antisemitic Discrimination,"The U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) today announced that Drexel University in Pennsylvania has entered into a resolution agreement to ensure compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI) when responding to allegations of discrimination or harassment based on national origin, including shared Jewish ancestry. While OCR confirmed that the specific incident prompting the complaint OCR investigated did not involve antisemitic conduct and that the university’s response to that incident did not raise Title VI concerns, OCR’s investigation reflects that the university generally failed to fulfill its obligations to assess whether incidents of shared ancestry discrimination and harassment reported to it created a hostile environment, and where the university did conduct this assessment it misapplied the legal standard. The initial investigation was prompted by an October 2023 complaint to OCR suggesting that a fire on the dormitory door of a suite where a Jewish student lived was motivated by antisemitism. After investigating, OCR confirmed the university’s documentation that, contrary to news reporting, the incident did not involve antisemitic discrimination and OCR found no evidence raising a Title VI concern regarding the university’s response. OCR’s investigation showed that in response to the incident and other incidents, the university took important proactive steps to support a nondiscriminatory campus environment, including by issuing multiple public statements condemning antisemitism, offering support and resources to students, and convening a meeting with the campus’s Jewish and Muslim leaders to reiterate the university’s available resources and reporting options. The university also increased security patrols focusing on Jewish-affiliated organizations; held mandatory residence hall meetings with students to reinforce the importance of respecting the property of others, including religious symbols; and the Hillel Rabbi conducted training specific to antisemitism for investigative staff. Notwithstanding these proactive university efforts, OCR conducted a review of university documentation of 35 other incidents of alleged harassment on the basis of national origin, including shared Jewish ancestry, that were reported to the university from October 2022 - January 2024. This review demonstrated growing evidence of a hostile environment for over 18 months. Examples included: graffiti saying “F— the Jews” with a swastika written in a women’s bathroom in October 2023; several student reports that mezuzot (small scrolls placed on doorposts in Jewish homes) were removed from their dormitory doors in November 2023; repeated social media threats including “F— you and f— Israel”; and a group of masked individuals vandalizing the university’s Center for Jewish Life in April 2024. The university’s actions were limited to addressing each incident on an individual basis, including offering supportive resources to students, but did not consider whether broader and more responsive action was needed for the university community. The university did not consistently conduct an assessment as to whether the conduct reported to it created a hostile environment. For example, when a student reported that an individual made racist and discriminatory jokes about people who wear hijabs, how “Indian people smell,” and that “Ashkenazi Jews are inferior,” the university simply offered supportive resources and outreach to the reporting student, without any assessment or determination regarding whether the underlying conduct created or contributed to a hostile environment. In addition, when the university did consider the existence of a hostile environment, it misapplied the legal standard in making its determination. For example, in one incident, the university did not consider that harassing conduct need not always be targeted at a particular person in order to create a hostile environment for a student or group of students. In another incident, the university failed to consider whether a student’s remarks posted to social media created or contributed to a hostile environment because the conduct occurred off campus and on social media. To resolve the concerns OCR identified, the university agreed to: Conduct a review of the university’s response to complaints and reports of antisemitic and other shared ancestry discrimination during the 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 academic years, and take remedial actions, if required. Provide OCR with information regarding any complaints alleging discrimination, including harassment, on the basis of shared ancestry during the 2024-2025 and 2025-2026 school years, and address OCR’s feedback, if any. Analyze the results of and create an action plan, subject to OCR approval, in response to its climate surveys. Revise its policies and procedures to ensure they consistently provide that it must assess whether incidents of reported shared ancestry discrimination or harassment have created a hostile environment within the university’s education program or activity, acknowledging that conduct that may have taken place off campus or on social media can contribute to a hostileenviron ment within a university program or activity. Continue to provide training to all employees and staff responsible for investigating complaints and other reports of discrimination, including harassment, based on shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics (including antisemitism). And, Conduct annual training on discrimination based on race, color and national origin, including harassment based on shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics, for all faculty, staff, and students. “The commitments Drexel has made today are designed to ensure its full compliance with Title VI, building on many critical proactive steps the university has already taken, and importantly bringing university practices in line with federal civil rights requirements,” said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon. “OCR will work with Drexel in the coming years to ensure its full satisfaction of its federal civil rights obligation to ensure that Jewish students at the university, and all students at the university, can learn safely in an environment free from stereotyped discrimination related to their shared ancestral backgrounds.” The resolution letter and resolution agreement are available on the Office for Civil Rights website ."
1-Aug-24,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/secretary-cardona-congratulates-2024-presidents-education-awards-program-recipients,Secretary Cardona Congratulates 2024 President’s Education Awards Program Recipients,"Elementary, middle and high school graduates across all U.S. states, outlying areas, and military bases selected by principals for academic achievement recognition U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona today congratulated the 2024 President’s Education Awards Program (PEAP) recipients, recognizing hundreds of thousands of elementary, middle, and high school graduates from public and private schools across all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Outlying Areas, and American military bases abroad on their educational accomplishments. Since moving all PEAP materials to digital download in 2022, there has been continual increase in participation of schools across the nation sharing in this award at their promotion and graduation ceremonies. This year, from the opening of the program in March through close-out in the month of June, there have been more than 158,000 unique downloads of 2024 PEAP materials, including the Excellence and Achievement certificates and letters from the President and the Secretary. “On behalf of President Biden, the Biden-Harris Administration, and our entire U.S. Department of Education team, I am thrilled to congratulate the recipients of our 2024 President’s Education Award,” Secretary Cardona said. “Our nation’s future is made brighter by these remarkable young people, each of whom have demonstrated a love of learning, spirit of determination, and strength of character that inspires us all. If education is the springboard to the American dream, then these students are well on their way to achieving great things.” PEAP was founded in 1983. Every year since then, the program has provided schools with the opportunity to recognize graduating students who meet high standards of academic excellence and those who have given their best effort, often overcoming obstacles to their learning. Each year, eligible graduating K-12 students are selected by their school principals for recognition in one of two categories: The President’s Award for Educational Excellence – recognizes academic success in the classroom. To be eligible, students must meet requirements, including grade point average or other school-set criteria and choice of state tests or teacher recommendations. The President’s Award for Educational Achievement –recognizes students who show outstanding educational growth, improvement, commitment, or intellectual development in their academic subjects but do not meet the criteria for the Educational Excellence Award. Its purpose is to encourage and reward students who give their best effort, often in the face of obstacles. Criteria for this award are developed at each school. Individual recognition is bestowed by the President and the U.S. Secretary of Education, in partnership with the National Association of Elementary School Principals and the National Association of Secondary School Principals. The award includes a congratulatory letter and a certificate signed by the President, the Secretary, and the school principal. Unlike other awards programs, the principal has sole discretion in choosing recipients based on eligibility. There is no limit on the number of awards that can be downloaded and printed, as long as students meet the criteria for each award set by the school. In addition to the 2024 PEAP materials, PEAP-related products, such as folders, pins, and graduation cords, remain available to order from the National Association of Elementary School Principals at https://www.services-naesp.org/peap/t-main.aspx."

Starting tomorrow, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) will begin emailing all borrowers with at least one outstanding federally held student loan to provide updates on potential student debt relief, and to inform them they have until August 30 to call their servicer and opt out if they do not want this relief. The rules that would provide this relief are not yet finalized, and the email does not guarantee specific borrowers will be eligible. The Department will provide additional information to borrowers once the rules are finalized this fall. These proposed rules build upon the Administration’s existing work that has approved more than $168 billion in student loan relief for nearly 4.8 million borrowers through various actions. These rules, if finalized as proposed, would bring the total number of borrowers eligible for student debt relief to over 30 million, including borrowers who have already been approved for debt cancellation by the Biden-Harris Administration over the past three years. “Today, the Biden-Harris administration takes another step forward in our drive to deliver student debt relief to borrowers who’ve been failed by a broken system,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “These latest steps will mark the next milestone in our efforts to help millions of borrowers who’ve been buried under a mountain of student loan interest, or who took on debt to pay for college programs that left them worse off financially, those who have been paying their loans for twenty or more years, and many others. The Biden-Harris Administration made a commitment to deliver student debt relief to as many borrowers as possible as quickly as possible, and today, as we near the end of a lengthy rulemaking process, we’re one step closer to keeping that promise.” In April, the Administration released its first set of draft rules that proposed authorizing the Secretary of Education to grant student debt relief to tens of millions of borrowers across the country, including those whose balances have grown due to runaway interest and those who entered repayment on their loans a long time ago, among others. If these rules are finalized as the Department has proposed, they would authorize the Secretary of Education to provide partial or full debt relief for the following groups of borrowers: Borrowers who owe more now than they did at the start of repayment. Borrowers would be eligible for relief if they have a current balance on certain types of Federal student loans that is greater than the balance of that loan when it entered repayment due to runaway interest. The Department estimates that this debt relief would impact nearly 23 million borrowers, the majority of whom are Pell Grant recipients. Borrowers who have been in repayment for decades. If a borrower with only undergraduate loans has been in repayment for more than 20 years (entered repayment on or before July 1, 2005), they would be eligible for this relief. Borrowers with at least one graduate loan who have been in repayment for more than 25 years (entered repayment on or before July 1, 2000) would also be eligible. Borrowers who are otherwise eligible for loan forgiveness but have not yet applied. If a borrower hasn’t successfully enrolled in an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan but would be eligible for immediate forgiveness, they would be eligible for relief. Borrowers who would be eligible for closed school discharge or other types of forgiveness opportunities but haven’t successfully applied would also be eligible for this relief. Borrowers who enrolled in low-financial value programs. If a borrower attended an institution that failed to provide sufficient financial value, or that failed one of the Department’s accountability standards for institutions, those borrowers would also be eligible for debt relief. If finalized as proposed, these new rules would authorize relief for borrowers across the country who have struggled with the burden of student loan debt. The Department expects that all four of these proposed forms of relief would be provided to eligible borrowers without requiring any action from borrowers; no application would be needed. If, however, borrowers prefer to opt out of this debt relief for any reason, they can do so by contacting their servicer by Aug. 30, 2024. Borrowers who opt out of this debt relief will not be able to opt back in, and they will also be temporarily opted out of forgiveness due to enrollment in an IDR plan until the Department is able to automatically assess their eligibility for that benefit in a few months. In addition, borrowers would only be eligible for the proposed relief if they have entered repayment at the time that the Department would be determining eligibility, after the proposed rules are finalized. More information for borrowers about this debt relief is available at StudentAid.gov/debt-relief . An unparalleled track record of borrower assistance The Biden-Harris Administration has taken historic steps to reduce the burden of student debt and ensure that student loans are not a barrier to educational and economic opportunity for students and families. The Administration secured a $900 increase to the maximum Pell Grant—the largest increase in a decade—and finalized new rules to help protect borrowers from career programs that leave graduates with unaffordable debts or insufficient earnings. The Administration continues its work to issue debt relief regulations under the Higher Education Act, with final regulations expected this fall. The Biden-Harris Administration has approved the following debt relief for borrowers: $69.2 billion for 946,000 borrowers through fixes to Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF). $51 billion for more than 1 million borrowers through administrative adjustments to IDR payment counts. These adjustments have brought borrowers closer to forgiveness and addressed longstanding concerns with the misuse of forbearance by loan servicers. $28.7 billion for more than 1.6 million borrowers who were cheated by their schools, saw their institutions precipitously close, or are covered by related court settlements. $14.1 billion for more than 548,000 borrowers with a total and permanent disability. $5.5 billion for 414,000 borrowers through the SAVE Plan."
30-Jul-24,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-host-strengthening-whole-child-communities-raising-bar-cradle-career-detroit-michigan,"U.S. Department of Education to Host Strengthening Whole Child Communities: Raising the Bar from Cradle to Career in Detroit, Michigan","On Thursday, August 1 and Friday, August 2, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) will host the Strengthening Whole Child Communities: Raising the Bar from Cradle to Career Summit in Detroit, Michigan. The summit will convene policymakers, practitioners, advocates, philanthropy leaders, youth and community-based organizations to reaffirm the importance of public education as a driver of opportunity and socioeconomic mobility for children and youth from low-income backgrounds and their families. Speakers and panelists will uplift examples of how schools and communities are effectively collaborating to strengthen prenatal-to-career continuums for students and families and support place-based efforts. The Strengthening Whole Child Communities Summit is hosted in partnership with the Ballmer Group, Kresge Foundation, Raikes Foundation and the Stuart Foundation. At the Summit, White House Domestic Policy Advisor Neera Tanden and U.S. Deputy Secretary of Education Cindy Marten will provide keynote remarks. The opening sessions of each day are open press; media availability with speakers will follow the conclusion of the opening session. Members of the media interested in attending are requested to RSVP to pressRSVP@ed.gov . Day 1 Opening Session WHO: White House Domestic Policy Advisor Neera Tanden U.S. Department of Education Assistant Secretary of the Office of Planning, Evaluation, and Policy Development Roberto Rodriguez WHEN: Thursday, August 1, 2024 9:15 - 10 a.m. ET WHERE: Marygrove Conservancy 8425 West McNichols Road Detroit, Michigan Day 2 Opening Session WHO: U.S. Deputy Secretary of Education Cindy Marten WHEN: Friday, August 2, 2024 9:30 - 10:15 a.m. ET WHERE : Marygrove Conservancy 8425 West McNichols Road Detroit, Michigan As part of the Department’s commitment to boldly improve learning conditions and address opportunity gaps, the summit will highlight funding opportunities through the Department’s Promise Neighborhoods grants program. The Promise Neighborhoods Program works to support academic, developmental, and other outcomes for children and youth living in communities of concentrated poverty and to provide services that will support students from early childhood through the course of their K-12 education. The FY2024 grant competition focuses on early implementation to help build the capacity of communities to create lasting place-based partnerships and cradle-to-career supports, as well as encourages applicants to engage young people in the planning and implementation of their grants. This year there are 3 competitive priorities and 1 invitational priority for the competition. The 3 competitive preference priorities are: 1) new applicants, 2) strengthening cross agency coordination for system change to address community violence prevention, and 3) promoting equity in student access to educational resources and opportunities. The invitational priority is designed to encourage applicants to increase regular student attendance and engagement and reduce chronic absenteeism through evidence-based strategies. The summit will also feature federal Full-Service Community School (FSCS) grantees who have built supportive and enriching learning environments for all students—including those furthest from opportunity. Specifically, FSCS grantees will share how they have built sustainable partnerships to provide essential services to support learning and foster student engagement, including nutrition services, dental, vision, and mental health support. FSCS Project Directors will share their insights on how other states, districts, and schools can connect with local educational agencies, institutes of higher education, community-based organizations, and nonprofit organizations to create impactful systems of learning and support. The Biden-Harris Administration has been a catalyst behind the expansion and impact of the FSCS program as it has grown from 42 grants in 2020 to 114 in 2024. And in just the past two years, the FSCS program’s reach has spread to an additional 359 districts, 2,023 schools, and over 1 million students. This is because the Administration has increased funding for the program from $25 million in 2020 to $150 million for each of the past two fiscal years. These investments have helped states, districts, and schools in 30 states implement their locally driven visions for education. To support these efforts and underscore the importance of public-private partnerships in supporting place-based strategies, several new commitments to supporting students and families from cradle to career will be announced at the Summit: The Kresge Foundation is committing: A $28.5 million guarantee to the Marygrove Conservancy to support the capital build-out of classroom and dormitory space to house undergraduate degree programs, realizing the full complement of cradle-to-career programming on the campus. $3 million over the next 3 years to implement a Cradle-to-Career Neighborhoods strategy to envision how neighborhoods in Detroit can center the needs of the whole child and whole family, from cradle to career, in order to retain and grow its population, catalyze economic development, and advance socioeconomic mobility for its existing residents. Support to Policy Equity Group, to launch a community of practice for attendees of the Summit on Strengthening Whole Child Communities, building a national network of communities interested in strengthening place-based approaches to serving the whole child and whole family and centering education as a driver of economic opportunity. The Raikes Foundation is committing: $10 million to improve outcomes for students and youth at risk of or experiencing homelessness. Over the next 2.5 years, the Raikes Foundation is supporting national, state, and local efforts to improve how students and older youth are served in and out of school to prevent or quickly address homelessness, in part by ensuring they graduate from high school."

The district entered into an agreement to ensure its compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI) when responding to discrimination based on race, color, and national origin, including antisemitic harassment of its students. OCR’s investigation determined that in the 2021-2022 and 2023-2024 school years, the district had notice of fifteen instances involving swastikas or other vandalism or harassment at the school that created a hostile environment for students based on their race, color, or national origin, including shared Jewish ancestry. OCR found that during the 2021-2022 school year, school administrators knew of nine incidents involving the use of swastikas and/or the n-word, including graffiti in a bathroom, swastikas written or etched on two classroom desks, the “SS” symbol drawn on a classroom desk, a swastika on a ruler handed out to students in class, and a swastika visible on the skin of a student. In the 2023-2024 school year, school administrators received reports of more swastikas in the school and a student expressing wanting “to kill all Jews and burn them in their homes,” among other incidents. While the district responded to these incidents by attempting to identify the responsible individuals and to discipline them when appropriate, OCR found that the district violated Title VI by failing to take effective steps reasonably calculated to eliminate the known hostile environment and to prevent its recurrence. OCR found that in some instances the district failed to evaluate whether a hostile environment existed for affected students and if they needed remedies to address the effects of that environment. OCR also identified a compliance concern that the district appears not to have met its Title VI obligation to maintain the records related to the district’s responses to notice of antisemitic harassment. To resolve the violations and the compliance concern that OCR identified, the district agreed to: Review specific incidents regarding students subjected to harassment based on race, color, or national origin in the 2021-2022, 2022-2023, and 2023-2024 school years to determine what further action is needed to equitably resolve these incidents for students; Review, revise, and disseminate districtwide policies and procedures for responding to reports of harassment and maintaining related records to ensure they satisfy Title VI; Issue written guidance to staff on the updated harassment policies and procedures; Implement new forms for tracking reports of harassment and the district’s responses; Notify all students and parents that discrimination based on race, color, and national origin, including shared ancestry, is prohibited in the district and how to report harassment on these bases; Implement a plan to educate students and parents about reporting harassment; Conduct a districtwide assessment of school climate, including specifically regarding antisemitism, with an emphasis on harassment and submit any proposed responsive action to OCR for review and approval; Train all administrators, faculty, and staff on the new policies, procedures, and forms; Train all school administrators who are responsible for processing, investigating, and/or resolving complaints of discrimination on how to investigate and document them; and Report to OCR the district’s responses to reports and complaints of harassment based on race, color, and national origin during the 2024-2025 and 2025-2026 school years. “Carmel Unified School District has committed to ensure that all of its students, including its Jewish students, can learn safely and without discriminatory harassment in its schools,” said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon. “OCR will work with the district in the coming years to protect students’ federal civil rights.""

It’s shameful that politically motivated lawsuits waged by Republican elected officials are once again standing in the way of lower payments for millions of borrowers. “Borrowers enrolled in the SAVE Plan will be placed in an interest-free forbearance while our Administration continues to vigorously defend the SAVE Plan in court. The Department will be providing regular updates to borrowers affected by these rulings in the coming days. “It wasn’t so long ago that a million borrowers defaulted on their student loans every single year, mainly because they couldn’t afford the payments. The SAVE plan is a bold and urgently needed effort to fix what’s broken in our student loan system and make financing a higher education more affordable in this country. The Biden-Harris Administration remains committed to delivering as much relief as possible for as many borrowers as possible. Already, we’ve approved an unprecedented $169 billion in relief for nearly 4.8 million Americans, including teachers, veterans, and other public servants, students who were cheated by their colleges, borrowers with disabilities, and more. And from larger Pell Grants to free community college, President Biden, Vice President Harris, and I continue to believe that college affordability is a cause worth fighting for – and we’re not giving up.”"

These approvals are the result of significant fixes that the Administration has made to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Program. This relief builds on President Biden and his Administration’s efforts to provide relief to as many borrowers as possible across the country. Today’s announcement brings the total loan forgiveness approved by the Biden-Harris Administration to $168.5 billion for 4.76 million Americans, which includes $69.2 billion for 946,000 borrowers through PSLF. Before President Biden took office, only 7,000 public servants had received debt relief through PSLF. “Once again, the Biden-Harris administration delivers on its historic efforts to reduce the burden of student debt—making needed and long overdue improvements to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Program. The additional Americans approved for PSLF today are hardworking public servants who will finally receive the financial breathing room they were promised—and all PSLF recipients can easily track and manage the process through StudentAid.gov,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “This is relief that will bring real change in their lives and marks another win for this administration’s relentless and unapologetic work to fix a broken student loan system.” This relief is a result of the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to overhauling the PSLF Program, which supports public servants—including teachers, nurses, firefighters, and other public servants -- by forgiving the remaining student loan balance for those who make the required 120 qualifying monthly payments. The debt relief announced today includes borrowers who have benefitted from the Biden-Harris Administration’s limited PSLF waiver, a temporary opportunity that ended in October 2022, as well as from regulatory improvements made to the program by this Administration. Secretary Cardona will head to Denmark, South Carolina to make this announcement with Congressman James Clyburn. They will visit Voorhees College and Denmark Technical College and speak to borrowers who have benefited from the Administration’s student loan relief efforts. “The Biden-Harris Administration’s actions to tackle the burden of student loan debt are making a difference in the lives of my constituents,” Congressman Clyburn said. “Every day, teachers, law enforcement officials and other government employees who have dedicated their lives to serving our community, are benefiting from the efforts of this Administration to lower cost and build an economy from the bottom up.” In addition to these fixes to PSLF, the Biden-Harris Administration has also implemented further improvements to PSLF to make it easier for borrowers to participate in the program. As of July 1, 2024, the PSLF Program is now fully managed by the Department through StudentAid.gov, rather than by a single, specialty loan servicer. That means that, for the first time, borrowers can now manage all aspects of their PSLF journey on StudentAid.gov, including submitting their PSLF form and tracking their progress toward forgiveness. These updates will simplify the process for borrowers and allow for faster processing of PSLF forms. These improvements have been in the works for since day one of the Administration as part of the Department’s efforts to overhaul loan servicing and implement significant improvements to all of its loan forgiveness programs, including PSLF.

During its investigation, OCR determined that the district had not taken steps specifically designed to ensure equal access to high rigor courses for students with disabilities, although the district had notice for years that students with disabilities participate in AP courses at rates well below their enrollment rates. In addition, specific district practices, such as promoting AP courses among students in courses in which students with disabilities under-enroll and an absence of district guidance for ensuring inclusion of students with disabilities may contribute to under-enrollment of these students. To resolve this investigation, the district has committed to: Complete a review and assessment of the district’s AP course offerings for the 2023-2024 school year and develop recommendations for ensuring equal access to AP courses for students with disabilities, including whether adjustments to its AP course enrollment practices would increase enrollment for students with disabilities. Review its communication with students and their parents, including students with disabilities and their parents, regarding the availability of AP courses and develop a protocol for ensuring that all students in 8th through 11th grade and their parents are provided with notice of the availability of AP courses, how to enroll in these courses, and the significance given to AP courses by colleges in the admissions process. Complete an evaluation of its academic counseling services at the district’s Middle School and High School and make changes, as necessary, to ensure that students with disabilities receive counseling that informs them of available AP course options. Provide training to all district Middle School and High School guidance counselors and teachers regarding the eligibility requirements for AP courses, and the importance of inclusion of students with disabilities in AP course enrollment. And, Develop a record-keeping system to identify the number of students with disabilities who participate in the district High School’s AP course offerings and ensure accurate reporting of data to OCR’s Civil Rights Data Collection. “Equal access to academically rigorous courses and programs is critical to ensuring all students can realize their educational dreams,” said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon. “I commend the Colonial School District for its cooperation throughout OCR’s investigation and its commitment to improve access for students with disabilities, and all students, to its AP courses.” The letter to the Colonial School District is available here and the resolution agreement is available here ."
17-Jul-24,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-releases-proposed-regulations-increase-college-access-and-quality-and-strengthen-oversight-distance-education,"Biden-Harris Administration Releases Proposed Regulations to Increase College Access and Quality, and Strengthen Oversight of Distance Education","The U.S. Department of Education (Department) today released proposed regulations that would increase college access for high school students, provide better public data on student outcomes, including to increase oversight over distance education programs, and ensure the student aid programs work in the best interests of students. The regulations propose changes to three distinct areas, including the federal TRIO programs, Distance Education, and Return to Title IV (R2T4). Today’s proposed regulations build on the Biden-Harris Administration’s efforts to increase college access and affordability and improve the quality and value of postsecondary education. “Under President Biden’s leadership, we continue our relentless push to make higher education more affordable and accessible to all Americans. The regulations proposed today, if enacted, would help expand both access and affordability to our most disadvantaged students: those from low-income backgrounds, students without immigration status, and students with disabilities,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “By broadening eligibility for federal programs and placing guardrails that help protect against situations that leave students with debt but no degree, we can open more doors to the life-changing potential of higher education.” The proposed regulations will be formally published in the coming days, and the public will be invited to comment on the proposed regulations for a period of 30 days. The rules propose needed and critical improvements to: • Increase Dreamers’ access to higher education through the federal TRIO programs. The TRIO programs are federal outreach and student services programs designed to identify and provide services for individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds, including low-income, first-generation college students, and students with disabilities. The proposed changes would expand eligibility to include students without immigration status who are enrolled in or seek to enroll in a high school in the United States, territories, or Freely Associated States. The expansion in eligibility would apply to the Upward Bound, Talent Search, and Educational Opportunity Center programs which serve students at the elementary and high school levels. These changes would increase high school completion, college access, enrollment, completion, and overall earnings of students without status. • Account for student outcomes in evaluating student success and increase oversight over programs offered through distance education. Online learning, which has substantially increased since the COVID-19 pandemic, has the potential to provide some flexibility to college students. However, the Department currently has very limited data on students enrolled in and programs offered through distance education which limits the Department’s ability to answer important questions about student outcomes and conduct adequate oversight over distance education. Proposed changes include requiring additional reporting for programs offered entirely through distance education and students’ distance education status which would allow the Department to share and evaluate data and protect students through offering closed school discharges when an institution ends a program offered in-person or online. The regulations also propose protections to make sure online students in career-focused programs get direct instructor interaction by prohibiting the use of asynchronous instruction. • Help students who withdraw from paying any outstanding balances and increase accuracy and simplicity of calculations for institutions under R2T4. R2T4 regulations govern the process institutions must conduct when an HEA Title IV recipient ceases attendance during a payment period. An R2T4 calculation determines whether funds must be returned by the school and/or student. The issue is one of the top compliance findings for institutions and raises complex and challenging questions. Proposed changes would help students who withdraw better pay down their balances so they may more easily return to their education and would streamline and simplify the calculation for institutions. The proposed regulations released today are the latest action in the Department’s ongoing work to better ensure students and taxpayers receive value from postsecondary education. The Department launched negotiations on Program Integrity and Institutional Quality with a series of public hearings in April 2023. The negotiating committee and TRIO subcommittee, which were formed to develop and inform proposed language, met over the course of January through March 2024, and reached consensus on the issue of TRIO expansion. In addition to the issues included in the notice of proposed rulemaking, the Department considered regulations on Accreditation, State Authorization, and Cash Management. As further detailed in a blog post today on the timing of forthcoming regulations, the remainder of those issues will be released in proposed rules in 2025.

17-Jul-24,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/justice-department-and-department-education-announce-continuing-success-student-loan-bankruptcy-discharge-process,Justice Department and Department of Education Announce Continuing Success of Student-Loan Bankruptcy Discharge Process,"WASHINGTON – The Justice Department, in close coordination with the Department of Education, announced today the continued and growing success of a process instituted in November 2022 for handling cases in which individuals seek to discharge their federal student loans in bankruptcy. Data and information tracking the effectiveness of the process over the last year and a half demonstrate that it is achieving its goal of providing a more transparent, equitable, and streamlined mechanism for borrowers to request a discharge of their student loans in consumer bankruptcy cases. The process has translated into increasing numbers of eligible federal student loan borrowers seeking and obtaining debt relief under the Bankruptcy Code. The departments finalized new guidance in November 2022 that outlined a fairer, more accessible process to ensure consistent treatment of the discharge of federal student loans, reduce the burden on borrowers of pursuing such proceedings, and facilitate identifying cases where discharge is appropriate. At the time, both Departments committed to an ongoing assessment of the guidance’s effectiveness. As part of that commitment, the Justice Department surveyed all 94 U.S. Attorneys’ Offices after the first year of implementation, and it recently repeated its survey to obtain updated information about use of the guidance. The information that the Departments have collected from these surveys indicates that the new process continues to be a success, and that an increasing number of borrowers are seeking and receiving discharges of their federal student loan debts. In particular, since the process was announced a year and a half ago, the data collected by the departments reveals that: As anticipated, case filings have steadily increased as consumers have learned of the new process. A total of 588 new cases were filed from October 2023 to March alone, which is a 36% increase from the prior six-month period. And a total of 1,220 cases were filed from November 2022 through March, a significant increase from recent years. The departments expect this trend to continue. The vast majority of borrowers seeking discharge continue to benefit from the guidance. In cases decided by the courts from November 2022 through March, 98% have provided debt relief through full or partial discharge. And the overall number of court judgments providing full or partial discharge have continued to increase, with the number of such judgments over the last six months exceeding the number of judgments for the preceding 12 months. Borrowers continue to embrace the new process set forth in the guidance in large numbers. In filed cases, 96% of all borrowers are voluntarily using the streamlined process, which includes a standard attestation form that allows borrowers more easily to identify and provide relevant information in support of their discharge request. Multiple bankruptcy courts have adopted procedures recognizing the utility of the new process, aimed at further streamlining the procedures debtors must follow to obtain discharges. “We are now able to evaluate the success of the student loan bankruptcy discharge guidance with a robust record of empirical information,” said Acting Associate Attorney General Benjamin C. Mizer. “The results are clear: this guidance has helped make the promise of a fresh start in bankruptcy a meaningful option for individuals weighed down by student loan debt.” “Our clear, fair, and practical standards are helping struggling borrowers find relief that was previously out of reach,” said U.S. Under Secretary of Education James Kvaal. “This data should puncture the myth that struggling borrowers cannot discharge their student loan debt through bankruptcy. We will continue to work with our partners at the Department of Justice to make it simpler and easier for borrowers to get much-needed relief in the way it was intended.” In addition to the internal data surveys, the Justice Department has taken other measures to support and evaluate the new guidance. The Justice Department has been consulting closely with the Department of Education on the process. Since the implementation of the guidance, a dedicated group of experts within the Justice Department’s Civil Division also has collected input on the new process from consumer law groups, including the National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys. Finally, the Civil Division has conducted trainings for Justice Department attorneys as well as members of the public, including training events supported by regional bar associations and the courts. The Department of Education also participated in training events hosted by regional bar associations, the American Bankruptcy Institute and U.S. Trustee Program, as well as at the annual meeting of the National Association of Chapter 13 Trustees, which included private attorneys as well as Chapter 13 trustees. The Departments will continue to monitor the impact of the guidance to ensure that it is appropriately implemented and meets the goals it was designed to achieve."
8-Jul-24,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-educations-office-civil-rights-announces-resolution-complaint-against-brown-university-alleging-antisemitic-discrimination,U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights Announces Resolution of Complaint Against Brown University Alleging Antisemitic Discrimination,"The U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) today announced that Brown University in Rhode Island has entered into a resolution agreement to ensure compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 with respect to alleged harassment of students based on national origin (including shared Jewish, Palestinian, Arab, and/or Muslim ancestry). A complaint was filed against the university in December 2023 alleging Title VI violations. OCR’s investigation confirmed that the university has taken notable proactive steps to support a nondiscriminatory campus environment, including updating its relevant policies and procedures in February 2024, providing university investigators with Title VI training specifically addressing shared ancestry discrimination in January 2024, and providing student and staff workshops on combating antisemitism and combating anti-Muslim hate in February and March 2024. However, OCR’s investigation also identified compliance concerns regarding the effectiveness of the university’s response to notice of alleged shared ancestry discrimination that could contribute to or create a hostile environment for students. Today, OCR is announcing that the university has signed a resolution agreement that will effectively ensure the university’s compliance with Title VI’s requirement of nondiscrimination based on shared ancestry. The university received some 75 reports of alleged antisemitic, anti-Palestinian, and anti-Muslim harassment against students from October 2023 through late March 2024. But the university appears to have taken no or little action in response other than to acknowledge receipt of the reports, list support resources, and request to meet with the complainant, consistent with its policies then in effect. These reports include allegations of serious harm, including, for example: allegations that students pointed at a Jewish classmate’s Star of David jewelry and yelled “Zionist pig Jew;” a Palestinian-American student’s roommate berated them about their Palestinian-American identity for weeks; and students blocked a Jewish classmate from attending a pro-Palestinian rally. OCR’s review of university records suggests that the university may have conditioned a fuller response to the harassing conduct on the complainant’s replying to the university’s outreach emails. So doing misapplies applicable law. Once a university has notice of alleged discrimination, it has a Title IV obligation to assess whether a hostile learning environment exists independent of whether a complainant does or does not respond to or meet with the university. Relatedly, OCR noted distinct variation among the half-dozen university entities responding to these reports, leaving university students and staff without consistent university redress. During the investigation, the university revised its practices to address a campus climate the university characterized as marked by anxiety, tension, and fear. The university reported organizing its updated practices around the following key priorities: Protecting the safety of its community, in particular supporting the needs and safety of its students, faculty, and staff who are Israeli, Palestinian, Muslim, Jewish, have ties to the region, and are feeling impacted by current events. Fostering welcoming, open, and respectful learning and living environments free of discrimination and harassment. Providing care and empathy to affected members of the Brown community. And, Taking the strongest possible stance against any form of discrimination and harassment including, but not limited to, antisemitism, anti-Muslim hate, or other unlawful discrimination based on actual or perceived shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics or citizenship or residency in a country with a dominant religion or distinct religious identity. OCR determined that monitoring the university’s fulfillment of these key priorities through the following resolution agreement terms will effectively ensure the university’s compliance with Title VI’s prohibition on discrimination based on shared ancestry: Further revising its policies and procedures to ensure all university offices consistently and effectively comply with Title VI, including with respectto prot ests and demonstrations. Conducting annual training on nondiscrimination and harassment for all students and employees. Maintaining records related to complaints or reports of discrimination under Title VI. Conducting a review of the university’s response to complaints and reports of antisemitic and other shared ancestry discrimination during the 2023-2024 and 2024-2025 academic years, and taking remedial actions if required. And, Analyzing the results of, and creating an action plan in response to, climate survey(s) and/or other review(s) focused on shared ancestry discrimination. “I commend Brown University for assessing its own campus climate and undertaking responsive reforms to comply with Title VI, in addition to the terms it agrees today to undertake in response to OCR’s investigation,” said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon. “OCR looks forward to work with the university to ensure a nondiscriminatory learning environment for its Jewish, Muslim, Israeli, and Palestinian students and students of all other backgrounds.” The letter to Brown University and the resolution agreement are available on the OCR website ."

On this day last year, the Supreme Court reversed course on decades of precedent and sharply limited a vital tool that colleges used to create vibrant, diverse campus communities and expand access to higher education for students of color, who too often face inequities in our education system. The decision was a blow to the fight for equal opportunity and a more just, equitable country. ""The Biden-Harris Administration is not backing down on its commitment to educational opportunity for all Americans. Over the past year, I've been encouraged to see many colleges take concrete action to preserve educational diversity and equity in their recruitment and admissions practices—as well as their efforts to promote inclusivity and supportive campus cultures. Following guidance released by the Department in the aftermath of this decision, many schools revised their admissions strategies to place student achievement in the context of adversity and resilience, such as their financial means, the opportunities available where they grew up, their personal experiences of hardship, including racial discrimination, and other hardships. We've seen schools launch targeted recruitment programs, and others that have increased affordability through need-based aid and ensuring transparency and simplicity in student aid processes. We also know the critical role K-12 plays in providing rigorous and engaging pathways to postsecondary education and the importance of strong partnerships between higher education and K12 in increasing access to postsecondary education for students of color. ""The Department applauds these efforts. I look forward to our continued work together to intentionally better support students of color and erase unacceptable disparities and inequities in higher education. The fight for a more inclusive system goes on. Together, we will continue to raise the bar for all our nation's students."""

The Department of Justice will continue to vigorously defend the SAVE Plan. The Biden-Harris Administration’s SAVE Plan is the most affordable repayment plan in history. We designed SAVE to cut undergraduate loan payments in half, avoid interest growth for borrowers making zero-dollar or low payments, and allow at-risk borrowers to reach forgiveness faster. Under SAVE, nearly 8 million Americans—one out of five borrowers—have breathing room from bills that, too often, compete with basic needs. But Republican elected officials and special interests sued to block their own constituents from being able to benefit from this plan – even though the Department has relied on the authority under the Higher Education Act three times over the last 30 years to implement income-driven repayment plans. “While we continue to review these rulings, the SAVE plan still means lower monthly payments for millions of borrowers - including more than 4 million borrowers who owe no payments at all, and protections for borrowers facing runaway interest when they are making their monthly payments. “President Biden, Vice President Harris, and I remain committed to our work to fix a broken student loan system and make college more affordable for more Americans. We remain proud of our work providing debt relief to more than 4.75 million Americans—including fixing the broken Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, providing income-driven repayment plans, relief for borrowers with disabilities, and relief for borrowers burdened with debt from predatory schools. We will continue to provide this long-overdue relief, no matter how many times Republican elected officials and their allies try to stop us.”"

21-Jun-24,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-educations-office-civil-rights-announces-resolution-complaint-against-lafayette-college-alleging-antisemitic-discrimination,U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights Announces Resolution of Complaint Against Lafayette College Alleging Antisemitic Discrimination,"The U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) today announced that Lafayette College (College) has entered into a resolution agreement to ensure its compliance with Title VI of the of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI) when responding to allegations of discrimination or harassment based on shared ancestry, including based on shared Jewish ancestry. OCR investigated the College’s response to an October 25, 2023 protest on campus and the College’s responses to notices of antisemitic and anti-Arab discrimination it received during fall 2023, and more recent events. The College engaged in many efforts to respond proactively to prevent the creation of a hostile environment during fall 2023. But the College nonetheless misapplied the legal standard, particularly with respect to harassment occurring on social media, and did not adequately discharge its obligation to take steps reasonably designed to assess the existence of, or redress any hostile environment affecting its campus. College records show inconsistent responses to the same conduct depending on whether it occurred on or off campus, responding to a student protester who carried a sign during a campus protest by repeatedly meeting with the student to discuss the harm the phrase on the sign could inflict and securing a commitment from the student never to use the phrase again in future campus protests but not responding to reports of use of the same phrase in social media or to other reports of social media content that students alleged had created a hostile environment for them. The College’s responses were not reasonably designed to redress any hostile environment. The College appears generally not to have addressed allegations of harassment occurring on social media unless the College considered the harassment to constitute a direct threat, not recognizing its Title VI obligation – which is not limited to conduct that occurs on campus or outside social media – to redress a hostile environment. To resolve the concerns OCR identified, the College agreed to: Review its response to previous reports of discrimination and/or harassment based on shared ancestry for the 2023-2024 academic year to ensure the College made a determination regarding whether the alleged conduct created a hostile environment, including incidents that occurred on social media or off campus. Provide OCR with documentation of the College’s response to all complaints alleging discrimination, including harassment, on the basis of shared ancestry, for the next two school years. Review and revise its policies and procedures to include a description of the forms of discrimination that can occur in the college environment and to ensure that the college’s response to notice of discrimination, including national origin harassment on the basis of shared ancestry, is consistent with Title VI. Provide training to all employees and staff responsible for investigating complaints and other reports of discrimination, including harassment, based on shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics (which includes antisemitism), as well as all staff involved in responding to reports of race, color, and national origin discrimination, regarding the College’s obligations under Title VI, as well as the College’s non-discrimination policies and procedures. Provide training to all staff and students regarding conduct prohibited by Title VI, the College’s responsibility to respond to allegations of discrimination, including harassment, based on shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics (which includes antisemitism), and the College’s antiharassment policies and procedures. “Lafayette College has committed to take the steps necessary to ensure its students are not subjected to antisemitic or anti-Arab hostile environments and have the equal access to education the law guarantees to them,” said Assistant Secretary for the Office for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon. “The College’s commitments today build on many laudable practices the College already had in place to support its campus community against discrimination, importantly bringing its responses in line with applicable Title VI legal requirements.” The resolution letter and resolution agreement are available on the Office for Civil Rights Website"
20-Jun-24,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-educations-office-civil-rights-releases-new-resources-protecting-students-disabilities-k12-and-higher-education,U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights Releases New Resources on Protecting Students with Disabilities in K12 and Higher Education,"The U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) released three new resources today with information for students, parents and families, and schools addressing the civil rights of students with sickle cell disease, epilepsy, and cancer. OCR issued these resources during a month that marks both World Sickle Cell Day and National Black Family Cancer Awareness Week . The resources inform students with disabilities, and their families and schools, about relevant legal rights under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Section 504 prohibits discrimination against students with disabilities by institutions that accept federal financial assistance, which includes almost all public schools and public and private institutions of higher education. These new resources, which are applicable to all levels of education, explain when these medical conditions trigger protections under Section 504, what kind of modifications an educational institution may need to take to avoid unlawful discrimination, and what an institution may need to do to remedy past discrimination. OCR is also responsible for enforcing Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national origin. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 90% of people with sickle cell disease in the United States are Black; Black Americans are more likely than White and Hispanic Americans to have active epilepsy (e.g., having one or more seizures in the past year and/or taking medication to control it); and, compared to other racial and ethnic groups, Black Americans have higher rates of getting and dying from many kinds of cancer . OCR enforces all the laws in its jurisdiction when they apply to cases OCR investigates. “These new resources will give all students experiencing sickle cell disease, epilepsy, or cancer, as well as their families and schools, important tools to understand when and how they are protected by federal disability rights laws,” said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon. The new resources regarding sickle cell disease , epilepsy , and cancer are available on the OCR website ."
20-Jun-24,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-issues-request-information-operational-approaches-extend-public-service-loan-forgiveness-early-childhood-educators,U.S. Department of Education Issues Request for Information on Operational Approaches to Extend Public Service Loan Forgiveness to Early Childhood Educators,"The U.S. Department of Education (the Department) issued a Request for Information (RFI) to help the Department better understand operational aspects of potentially expanding Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) for workers in early childhood education (ECE) settings. “Early childhood educators help young children learn, grow, and thrive. But they are often poorly compensated, and student debt is a problem. If these educators can access Public Service Loan Forgiveness, we can help our youngest children, their families, and their communities,” said U.S. Under Secretary of Education James Kvaal. Since its creation in 2007, PSLF has been available to Federal student loan borrowers who are employed by a government or certain types of not-for-profit organizations. Participating borrowers see the remaining balance of their Federal student loans forgiven after making 120 qualifying payments on their loans, which typically takes about 10 years. Through the Biden-Harris Administration’s efforts to overhaul this program and provide relief to as many borrowers as possible, more than 900,000 borrowers (compared to 7,000 prior to this Administration) have already been approved for $68 billion in forgiveness through PSLF. While many borrowers have received relief, under the current PSLF program rules, hundreds of thousands of ECE educators, many of whom operate small businesses, are excluded from the program because of their employer’s tax status. The ECE workforce, regardless of the tax status of the employer, is made up almost entirely of women, including a disproportionate number of women of color and immigrants. Additionally, the ECE workforce is among the lowest-paid categories of occupations in the country. Based on data from the National Survey of Early Care and Education conducted by the Department of Health and Human Service’s Office of Planning, Research, and Evaluation, extending PSLF eligibility to include employers of ECE workers, regardless of their employer’s tax status, could potentially allow more than 450,000 ECE workers—about 68,000 in home-based settings and 390,000 in center-based settings—to make progress toward PSLF if those workers have Federal student loans. This reflects roughly one-third of the overall ECE workforce. Since day one, the Biden-Harris Administration has worked to improve the broken student loan system, including making lasting improvements to the PSLF program. This request will help the Department gather important information about how it could implement any potential expansion of PSLF for ECE workers, yet another step toward these goals. In July 2022, the Department published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in the Federal Regist erthat proposed improvements to PSLF to reduce regulatory and administrative barriers that have historically made it more difficult for borrowers to make progress toward PSLF. Additionally, in the NPRM, the Department asked directed questions about the possibility of allowing employers that operate as private, for-profit businesses and employ ECE workers to be considered eligible employers for PSLF. In November 2022, the Secretary published these final regulations in the Federal Register . Although the Department received many detailed comments in response to the directed questions, those final regulations did not address whether, or under what circumstances, private, for-profit ECE providers employing borrowers working in ECE should be treated as qualifying employers for PSLF. Accordingly, the Department is soliciting comments from researchers, academics, policy experts, administrators, and other individuals familiar with ECE employer data and the administration of ECE programs about how the Department would determine employer eligibility and related considerations if for-profit ECE employers who provide services listed in the statute were to be considered eligible employers. Members of the public will have 30 days to submit comments for the Department to then review. The comments received in response to this RFI will not be used as part of the rulemaking related to the treatment of for-profit employers, including ECE providers, and eligibility for PSLF. Instead, the feedback from this RFI will help inform the Department’s understanding of different operational approaches. The RFI and additional information on submitting comments can be found here ."

This resolution addresses discrimination concerns in CUNY schools from academic year 2019-2020 forward. OCR has been investigating whether the university and/or Hunter College, Brooklyn College, the School of Law, and Baruch were on notice of and failed to respond promptly or effectively to alleged discrimination and antisemitic harassment by employees and students at the colleges and schools, creating a hostile environment for students of Jewish ancestry since academic year 2019-2020. In addition, OCR has been investigating whether the university and/or Hunter College, the School of Law, and Queens have discriminated against students on the basis of their actual or perceived national origin/ancestry, including shared Palestinian, Arab, Muslim, and/or South Asian ancestry and their association with these national origins/ancestries) since October 2023. Because OCR identified concerns regarding systemwide fulfillment of CUNY’s federal nondiscrimination obligations, CUNY committed to resolve all nine complaints to ensure every one of the 25 CUNY campuses protects all students against shared ancestry discrimination that violates Title VI without further delay. The complaints this agreement resolves include: Hunter : Two cases, one alleging harassment of students based on national origin (shared Jewish ancestry) in academic year 2020-2021 ; and the other alleging harassment and disparate treatment of students based on actual or perceived national origin/ethnicity (including shared Palestinian, Arab, Muslim, and/or South Asian ancestry and association with these national origins/shared ancestries) since October 2023 . Brooklyn : One case alleging harassment of students on the basis of national origin (shared Jewish ancestry) and actual or perceived race/color in fall 2020 . The Law School : Three cases, two alleging harassment of students based on national origin (shared Jewish ancestry) during academic years 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 ; and another alleging harassment and disparate treatment of students based on actual or perceived national origin/ethnicity (including shared Palestinian, Arab, and/or Muslim ancestry and association with these national origins/shared ancestries) since October 2023 . Queens : One case, alleging harassment and disparate treatment of students based on actual or perceived national origin/ethnicity (including shared Palestinian, Arab, Muslim, and/or South Asian ancestry and association with these national origins/shared ancestries) since October 2023 . Baruch : One case, alleging, among other things, harassment of students based on their national origin (shared Jewish ancestry) during spring 2022 . Central Office : One case, alleging harassment of students on the basis of national origin (shared Jewish ancestry) across the university’s constituent colleges and schools since academic year 2020-2021 . With respect to the earliest filed complaint against Hunter, OCR’s investigation confirmed that students and faculty disrupted two different sessions of a required college course in 2021 by commandeering the scheduled course discussion to use the class time to call for the decolonization of Palestine. Several students expressed that the disruption made them fearful and at least one student left class early. A Jewish student testified that when Jewish students spoke or tried to speak, others told them they should be listening, not speaking. OCR’s investigation also confirmed that Hunter concluded – without interviewing any students who were present during the Zoom sessions – that the class disruption did not deny access to education at Hunter. OCR determined that Hunter could not have adequately evaluated what occurred in the sessions and whether it created a hostile environment for Jewish students without interviewing affected students. OCR’s investigation also yielded no evidence that Hunter took any action to communicate to affected students the results of its investigation or that it took actions to redress any hostile environment students may have experienced. In addition to the concerns OCR’s investigation to date had raised regarding Hunter, OCR identified compliance concerns that specific CUNY colleges and schools appear not to have conducted adequate investigations in response to reports of alleged harassment based on national origin/shared ancestry, may treat students differently based on their national origin/shared ancestry with respect to implementation of policies and procedures governing student conduct and events on campus, may not have taken steps reasonably designed to redress existing hostile environments, and in some circumstances may not have considered whether the alleged conduct subjected students to possible hostile environments at all. Based on these related compliance concerns regarding several of CUNY’s constituent campuses, CUNY entered into a CUNY-wide agreement to ensure that CUNY and each of its 25 constituent colleges and schools fulfill their Title VI responsibilities when responding to discrimination, including harassment, based on national origin/shared ancestry. In the resolution agreement, CUNY has committed to: Reopen or initiate investigations of complaints and reports alleging discrimination, including harassment, on the basis of national origin, including shared Jewish, Palestinian, Muslim, Arab, and/or South Asian ancestry, or association with these national origins/shared ancestries. For each investigation, provide OCR with the results of the investigation, and for each finding of a hostile environment created by harassment based on national origin/shared ancestry, report to OCR any remedial action to be taken by CUNY, including actions to remedy the effects of the environment and prevent recurrence. Provide training to employees responsible for investigating complaints and other reports of discrimination, including harassment, based on national origin/shared ancestry or association with the national origin/shared ancestry, to ensure thorough and impartial investigations, including that the investigators know how to identify relevant witnesses to interview and how to conduct interviews about such harassment and whether it created a hostile educational environment. Provide training for campus peace officers on CUNY’s Title VI obligations not to discriminate based on national origin, including shared ancestry, how to engage effectively with CUNY students and the campus community, and how to ensure accurate collection and reporting of complaints and other information regarding interactions between public safety officers and students, as required by Title VI. Ensure that each of CUNY’s 25 constituent colleges and schools administers at least one climate survey to students no later than September 30, 2024. And, Continue the third-party reviews currently being conducted of CUNY’s nondiscrimination and antisemitism policies, at the direction and request of New York State Governor Kathy Hochul, and the other by an advocacy group. “Everyone has a right to learn in an environment free from discriminatory harassment based on who they are,” said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon. “In fully executing the important commitments announced today, the City University of New York will ensure that its students may learn in the nondiscriminatory environment federal law promises to them and that each CUNY school fulfills its Title VI obligation to evaluate the facts needed to protect all students’ nondiscrimination rights.” The letter to CUNY and resolution agreement are available on the OCR website ."
17-Jun-24,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-educations-office-civil-rights-announces-resolution-two-complaints-against-university-michigan-alleging-antisemitic-discrimination,U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights Announces Resolution of Two Complaints Against the University of Michigan Alleging Antisemitic Discrimination,"The U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) today announced that the University of Michigan (university) has entered into a resolution agreement to ensure its compliance with Title VI of the of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI) when responding to allegations of discrimination or harassment, including based on shared Jewish ancestry and shared Palestinian or Muslim ancestry. In OCR’s review of university documentation of 75 reports the university received alleging shared ancestry harassment and/or discrimination from the 2022-23 school year through February 2024, OCR found no evidence that the university complied with its Title VI requirements to assess whether incidents individually or cumulatively created a hostile environment for students, faculty, or staff, and if so, to take steps reasonably calculated to end the hostile environment, remedy its effects, and prevent its recurrence. For example, in October 2023, protestors shouted on the central campus about “Nazi liberation,” but University records do not identify any steps the university took to assess the existence of or redress for any resulting hostile environment from the conduct; but university records show only that the university forwarded the reports to university public affairs for response. Similarly, the university did not assess the existence of a hostile environment or take remedial action when a Jewish student reported having been targeted and harassed on social media that same month. This student reported that after he viewed a graduate student instructor’s Instagram story that included a discussion of pro-Palestinian topics, the instructor screenshotted that the student had viewed the story and posted a new story, tagging the student in the post and showing that he had an Israeli flag in his bio, with a comment saying, “Did you like my educational talk.” The university merely responded to the reporting student that “formal conflict resolution is not a path forward at this time” because social media “is largely going to be protected as free speech” and told the student about informal resolution pathways. And when a student reported to the university in November 2023 that someone yelled an accusation at her that she had “terrorist” friends because she participated in a pro-Palestinian protest, the university reported that it held “restorative circles” to address the incident, but took no further action to address effects on students from the widely reported anti-Palestinian incident. The information provided by the university to date in this investigation also raises concerns that diffuse university policies leave students, faculty, and staff unclear as to how the university will respond to alleged discrimination. In addition, although the university’s Equity, Civil Rights and Title IX office (ECRT), by university policy, is responsible for ensuring compliance with federal antidiscrimination laws, the university did not ensure that the office evaluated all reports of Title VI discrimination or oversee responses to determine compliance with Title VI. However, the university has indicated that it is taking steps for ECRT to assume primary responsibility for addressing Title VI complaints. To resolve the Title VI concerns OCR identified during investigation of these complaints, the university has committed to: Reviewing case files for each report of discrimination and/or harassment on the basis of shared ancestry during the 2023-2024 school year to determine whether the alleged conduct created a hostile environment and whether any further action is needed to provide an equitable resolution of each incident. Reporting to OCR on its responses to reports of discrimination, including harassment on the basis of shared ancestry, during the 2024-2025 and 2025-2026 school years. Revising as necessary university policies and procedures to ensure that they adequately address the Title VI prohibition on discrimination based on race, color, and national origin, including discrimination based on a student’s actual or perceived shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics. Ensuring the university coordinates compliance with Title VI through its Equity, Civil Rights, and Title IX office. Training employees, including university law enforcement, regarding the university’s obligations under Title VI to respond to alleged discrimination, and university policies and procedures. And, Administering a climate assessment for students and employees to evaluate the extent to which students and/or employees are subjected to or witness discrimination and harassment based on race, color, and national origin, including discrimination based on actual or perceived shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics, as well as knowledge of university procedures for reporting such discrimination. The university will use the results of such assessments to identify responsive steps for OCR’s review and approval. “The University of Michigan’s comprehensive commitments today put the university on a path for the coming school year and beyond to ensure that all its students may study without antisemitic discrimination or discrimination based on the region of the world they and their families come from,” said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon. “I am grateful to the University of Michigan for its speedy commitment to course correct following the volatile campus conditions since October 2023.” Title VI’s protection from national origin discrimination extends to students who experience discrimination, including harassment, based on their actual or perceived shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics, such as students of Jewish, Palestinian, Muslim, Arab, and/or South Asian descent, or citizenship or residency in a country with a dominant religion or distinct religious identity, or their association with this national origin/ancestry.

FAFSA Executive Advisor The Department is committed to carrying out transformational changes at FSA, including continuing making improvements to the Better FAFSA, and to ensure a smooth launch and successful 2025-26 FAFSA season. The Department is bringing on Jeremy Singer, a technology solutions expert, to help FSA deliver the Better FAFSA and improved experience for students and families. Singer is taking temporary leave from his role as President of College Board to join the Department. He will lead FSA’s overall strategy on the 2025-26 FAFSA form, working closely with the Department’s leadership and the FAFSA implementation team to strengthen internal systems and processes, bolster technical capabilities, and drive innovation to help ensure optimal performance leading to the launch of the 2025-26 FAFSA form. “Jeremy brings deep experience having successfully led the development and introduction of major technology innovations in education, which will be integral to improving the FAFSA experience and ensuring millions of students and families can easily access the federal financial aid they are entitled to,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. The Department remains committed to ensuring all students receive the federal aid they need to access higher education and is working to improve the application experience for the next FAFSA cycle. The Department has heard from students, families, institutions, states, and those that support them that it is most important for the 2025-26 FAFSA form to be available on October 1st, and the Department is working toward that goal. To minimize disruptions and ensure a smooth experience for students, families and institutions, the 2025-26 FAFSA will remain consistent with the 2024-25 form. The Department has made significant progress to address and resolve all major known issues with the 2024-25 form and will continue to make improvements to the form to enable a better user experience. For the 2024-25 award year, which will begin July 1, 2024, the Department has already received and processed over 11.1 million FAFSA forms. The Department also released new data that show that it has made significant progress in closing the gap in FAFSA submissions to 8 percent compared to this time last year, down from nearly 40 percent in March. This FAFSA cycle was the culmination of extraordinary change: Over 20 systems within FSA, some over 50 years old, had to be rebuilt from the ground up. The changes have meant that students can complete the form faster – many in less than 15 minutes. 7.1 million students in total are expected to be eligible for Pell Grants, including 5.7 million students eligible for a maximum Pell Grant, making 1.7 million more students receiving the maximum Pell Grant. Overall, 665,000 more students will receive Pell grants. The expansive scope and timeline of the changes for the 2024-25 FAFSA has been challenging for students, families, institutions, states, and organizations that support them. The Department will continue to work with partners and solicit specific feedback on ways to improve the help text on the form, student tip sheets, and other direct communication to students to ensure students can successfully complete the 2025-26 FAFSA. We will also conduct a series of listening sessions over the coming weeks to inform how we can better support students, families, colleges, states, and other partners for a successful 2025-26 FAFSA season. In addition, the Department will publish a Request for Information (RFI) this summer to solicit feedback from those not able to attend the sessions. The listening sessions and RFI will also lead to the development of a new Better FAFSA Better Future Roadmap, to be released in late summer, that will outline new tools the Department is making available such as additional trainings, webinars, counselor guides, and student tip sheets. FAFSA Student Support Strategy In May, the Department launched the FAFSA Student Support Strategy to increase the number of students completing their FAFSAs and enrolling in college. This strategy has now provided over $30 million in funding and counting and has reached more than 180 organizations across the country. The funding is supporting various projects and activities, including launching paid media campaigns to increase FAFSA completion, providing stipends to school counselors hosting FAFSA completion events, launching mobile FAFSA clinics, providing one-on-one support during FAFSA office hours, translation services, and other activities all organizations focused on ensuring that students and families are successful in submitting the 2024-25 FAFSA. This work will continue through the summer months. A regularly updated list of awardees can be found at the ECMC website ."

30-May-24,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/secretary-cardona-outlines-steps-modernizing-office-federal-student-aid,Secretary Cardona Outlines Steps to Modernizing the Office of Federal Student Aid,"EDITOR'S NOTE: The following message was posted today on the Education Department's Homeroom blog . In a letter sent to all staff today, U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona outlined comprehensive steps the Department is taking to improve Federal Student Aid (FSA) for students, families, borrowers, and schools. These efforts will ensure FSA works better and addresses ongoing management and operational challenges. Specifically, the Department is taking the following steps: Searching for a new Chief Operating Officer (COO) for FSA. Conducting a full-scale review of FSA’s current and historical organization, management, staffing, workflow structures, business processes, and operations to continue bringing the federal financial aid system into to the 21st century. Hired an independent consulting firm to make recommendations to the COO and the Secretary on ways to improve the design, structure, and processes within FSA, with a focus on building an updated organizational structure and workflow. Reviewing contracts and acquisition procedures to ensure contracts are appropriately structured to hold vendors accountable for meeting key deadlines, achieving desired outcomes, and providing the best value to the agency and protecting taxpayers’ resources. The Department is also restructuring senior leader reporting protocols to increase accountability and make sure we provide the best value to the agency and protect taxpayers’ resources. The Department will also create a new IT innovation team empowered to lead information technology design to support the digital transformation of the organization. This new team will oversee recruitment of top engineers, project managers, and designers who will bring critical information technology expertise and experience to strengthen FSA’s work in this area. Seeking input from the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) and engaging Members of Congress, whose constituents receive services from FSA. Continuing our robust outreach efforts to parents, students, colleges, and community organizations, and conduct listening sessions with them this summer. The Secretary’s full letter to staff follows below: Dear Colleagues, For half a century, Federal Student Aid (FSA) has helped millions of Americans access higher education. Today, FSA maintains the same mission. But like any organization, its methods and scope of work have changed dramatically over time, and the environment where it now operates is continuously evolving. FSA has worked to accommodate those changes over the years, including fulfilling congressional directives under tight budgetary constraints and addressing ongoing management and operational challenges. Over the last three years, the Department and FSA have made great strides in making sure federal financial aid is put in the hands of students. We have also taken unprecedented steps to protect borrowers from servicing errors while holding servicers accountable. However, changes are needed to make sure students, borrowers, and families have a better user experience with FSA, and we can achieve better outcomes for the millions of people we serve. Today, I am announcing new, comprehensive efforts to improve FSA for students, families, borrowers, and schools. These efforts include changes in leadership, boosting oversight and accountability, and engaging a variety of stakeholders so that FSA works best for our most important stakeholders—students and families. New Leadership The Department has already begun a search for a new Chief Operating Officer (COO) for FSA. This leader will be responsible for launching a full-scale effort to improve the management and execution of critical services and projects, with a focus on information technology and development. FSA’s next COO will have extensive executive leadership experience, as well as an understanding of complex, interconnected programs and services. This leader will have a strong commitment to best serving our students, families, borrowers, and schools. While the search for a new COO is underway, Denise Carter has been named Principal Deputy Chief Operating Officer (PDCOO). A seasoned leader at the Department, PDCOO Carter brings more than three decades of experience managing complex, multifaceted organizational components with rigor, dedication, and efficiency. She understands the importance of immediate-term improvements to FSA’s execution and management and is already taking steps to tighten processes for FSA projects and programs. Transforming Operations and Improving Oversight The Department is committed to carrying out transformational changes at FSA, informed by input from students, educators, and experts in systems design. To meet increased demand and improve the student and borrower experience, the Department will undertake a full-scale review of FSA’s current and historical organization, management, staffing, workflow structures, business processes, and operations. This includes a review of contracts and acquisition procedures to hold vendors accountable for performance issues. The Department has also hired an experienced, independent firm that will make recommendations to the COO and me on ways to improve the design of FSA, with a focus on building an updated organizational structure and workflow. This will enable FSA to achieve its objectives effectively and efficiently, including supporting students, families, borrowers, and schools. In addition to considering external recommendations, the changes will also include an immediate restructure of senior leader reporting protocols to increase outcome-based accountability. The new leadership at FSA, in consultation with the Department, will be examining FSA’s leadership needs, changing work assignments, and bringing in senior leaders to oversee critical workstreams. They are also onboarding IT team members empowered to lead and support innovative information technology development and implementation. This includes recruiting top engineers, project managers, and designers who will bring critical information technology expertise and experience to support the 2025-2026 FAFSA implementation and other key information technology initiatives. Engagement with External Stakeholders To ensure both internal and external input into the process of improving services at FSA, the Department will seek input from the Office of Inspector General (OIG) and engage Members of Congress, whose constituents receive services from FSA. We look forward to engaging the OIG. OIG’s thoughtful analysis, insight, and experience with holistic reviews will support our efforts to modernize, improve operations, and create efficiencies within FSA. Similarly, we welcome the opportunity to work in bipartisan fashion with key congressional leaders. Continuing engagement on planned improvements with congressional partners is critical to ensuring that initiatives will better serve the needs of the millions of constituents that FSA supports. Finally, we will maintain our robust outreach efforts to parents, students, colleges, and community organizations that have been critical partners in boosting FAFSA® submissions and troubleshooting applications at a grassroots level. Listening sessions with stakeholders this summer will drive program delivery and improvements at FSA. To date, FSA has processed more than 10 million FAFSA® applications. As we implement these changes at FSA, we remain committed to ensuring its core functions continue. From administering the FAFSA®, awarding Pell Grants and campus-based aid, managing student loans, overseeing more than 5,000 institutions of higher education, and more—we are working tirelessly to help all students have access to the resources they need to attain higher education. Sincerely, Miguel A. Cardona, Ed. D. U.S. Secretary of Education"

OCRs investigation raised concerns that similarly situated Native American and white students have been treated differently at the referral and sanctioning stages of the districts discipline process and with respect to access, referral, identification, and selection for the districts advanced learning programs and courses.

OCRs review found evidence indicating that (1) Native American students were being disciplined more frequently and more harshly than similarly situated white students, and (2) that Native American students were discriminated against with respect to access, referral, identification, and selection for the districts advanced learning programs and courses including honors courses and Advanced Placement courses.

To resolve this investigation, the district commitments include:

Examining the root causes of possible discrimination in the districts discipline and advanced learning programs and implementing corresponding corrective action plans.
Employing a discipline equity supervisor with expertise in nondiscriminatory discipline practices to help the district implement the corrective action plan and the agreement.
Employing an advanced learning coordinator with expertise in addressing the underrepresentation of Native American students in advanced learning programs and courses to help the district implement the corrective action plan and the agreement.
Establishing a standing committee, consisting largely of Native American community members, to inform implementation of the plans.
Revising its discipline and truancy policies and procedures, including regarding law enforcement involvement in school discipline.
Revising its advanced learning policies and procedures.
Regularly analyzing and tracking its student discipline and truancy data, and its advanced learning data to identify and, as needed, address possible areas of discrimination.
Providing training to staff on the revised policies and practices.
Reporting disaggregated discipline and advanced learning data.
Through this agreement, Rapid City Area School district has committed to take actions to ensure nondiscrimination for Native American students, said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon. OCR looks forward to working with the Rapid City Area School district to improve equal learning opportunities for all its students.

Since rolling out the Better FAFSA form, the Department has made significant progress to address known issues with the form. Students who complete a Better FAFSA online today can expect their records to be sent to colleges within one to three days. According to the latest data, nearly 90% of nonprofit and four-year institutions are packaging and sending out aid offers to students. A surge in FAFSA submissions in recent weeks has closed the gap from nearly 40 percent just two months ago to 12 percent today -- and this gap continues to fall. In order to encourage Better FAFSA submissions, the Department developed the FAFSA Support Strategy, now with two distinct arms, supporting institutions of higher education and students and families across K-12 and higher education. The Department will continue to work to make improvements to the FAFSA experience for students, families, and our other key partners.

""Thanks to the countless educators, schools, financial aid officers, and community partners across the country who have worked hard, along with the Department, to motivate students to fill out FAFSA, we have real momentum,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""We will continue to leave no stone unturned in pursuit of our goal of ensuring that every student has the help they need to access the life-changing potential of higher education.""

FAFSA Student Support Strategy

To complement college supports, the FAFSA Student Support Strategy was created to increase the number of students completing their FAFSAs and enrolling in college, particularly first-time college students and students of color. Since the Student Support Strategy launched on May 6, over 65 organizations have received funds through the partnership with ECMC and are already putting this funding to work to increase FAFSA submissions.

Projects include providing stipends to school counselors hosting FAFSA completion events, launching mobile FAFSA clinics, providing one-on-one support during FAFSA office hours, providing translation services, ensuring support extends through the summer months, and other activities all organizations focused on ensuring that students and families are successful in submitting the FAFSA.

Today, ECMC announced the first tranche of organizations receiving funding through this program. In total over 65 organizations have received funding including the following examples provided by ECMC:

Iowa College Access Network - will provide evening and weekend availability for in-person or virtual FAFSA completion appointments at each of its 7 offices statewide. Additionally, they will work with school counselors to provide up to 75 completion events for high schools and communities as well as host 4 FAFSA Step-by-Step webinars (with 2 conducted fully in Spanish) for families. They will also recruit up to 50 school counselors to join the FAFSA completion initiative and work locally to boost completion in their schools.

College Access Fairfax, Falls Church, VA - will assist nearly 1,000 students in completing and submitting the FAFSA. They will hold in-person completion events and schedule individual appointments with other students who need the assistance. CAF intends to hire translators to assist in communicating with families.

Centro Hispano de East Tennessee, Knoxville, TN - will conduct FAFSA completion events, in Knoxville and surrounding region in schools with high populations of immigrant families. They will also support more staff time to continue these efforts through the summer months.

Oregon TRIO Association, Astoria, OR - will hold hands-on FAFSA Support Workshops in local communities during evenings and weekends, specifically designed to assist students and parents in completing FAFSA. Additionally, they will allocate additional funding for staff to support extended hours for TRIO professionals, enabling them to facilitate workshops beyond their regular positions.

FAFSA College Support Strategy

In February of this year, the Department made funds available to support institutions of higher education through the FAFSA College Support Strategy. Under this strategy, the Department is deploying federal personnel, allocating millions in technical assistance and support, and providing tools to help schools prepare to process student records as efficiently as possible. To date, our partners have supported over 270 institutions, including over 60 Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). In addition, FSA staff have worked directly with colleges including more than 100 campus visits.

Through its college and student support strategies, the Department will continue to work to make sure students and families can access the maximum financial aid they are entitled to, and that schools have the resources and support they need."
21-May-24,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-announces-additional-77-billion-approved-student-debt-relief-160000-borrowers,"Biden-Harris Administration Announces Additional $7.7 Billion in Approved Student Debt Relief for 160,000 Borrowers","The Biden-Harris Administration announced today the approval of $7.7 billion in additional student loan debt relief for 160,500 borrowers. These discharges are for three categories of borrowers: those receiving Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF); those who signed up for President Biden’s Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) Plan and who are eligible for its shortened time-to-forgiveness benefit; and those receiving forgiveness on income-driven repayment (IDR) as a result of fixes made by the Administration. This action comes as more than 8 million borrowers have been helped by the SAVE Plan. That includes 4.6 million with a $0 monthly payment. Today’s announcement brings the total loan forgiveness approved by the Biden-Harris Administration to $167 billion for 4.75 million Americans. Thanks to this Administration’s efforts more than one out of every 10 federal student loan borrowers has now been approved for some debt relief. This action builds on President Biden and his Administration’s efforts to provide debt relief to as many borrowers as possible as quickly as possible. “The Biden-Harris Administration remains persistent about our efforts to bring student debt relief to millions more across the country, and this announcement proves it,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “One out of every 10 federal student loan borrowers approved for debt relief means one out of every 10 borrowers now has financial breathing room and a burden lifted.” Recently, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) also announced an update on the timing of the payment count adjustment. This administrative fix ensures borrowers get credit for progress borrowers made toward IDR forgiveness and PSLF. Borrowers who would benefit from consolidating now have until June 30, 2024 to apply to consolidate. Borrowers can find out more about the payment count adjustment here . The debt relief announced today is broken down into the following categories: $5.2 billion for 66,900 borrowers through fixes to PSLF: The Administration has now approved $68 billion in forgiveness for more than 942,000 borrowers through PSLF. $613 million for 54,300 borrowers through the SAVE Plan: This relief will go to borrowers enrolled in the SAVE Plan who had smaller loans for their postsecondary studies. Borrowers can receive relief after at least 10 years of payments if they originally borrowed $12,000 or less. Each additional $1,000 in borrowing adds 12 more months until forgiveness. All borrowers on the SAVE Plan receive forgiveness after 20 or 25 years, depending on whether they have loans for graduate school. The benefit is based upon the original principal balance of all Federal loans borrowed to attend school, not what a borrower currently owes or the amount of an individual loan. Today’s announcement brings total relief approved under the SAVE Plan to $5.5 billion for 414,000 borrowers. $1.9 billion for 39,200 borrowers through administrative adjustments to IDR payment counts. These adjustments have brought borrowers closer to forgiveness and address longstanding concerns with the misuse of forbearance by loan servicers. Including today’s announcement, the Biden-Harris Administration has now approved $51.0 billion in IDR relief for more than 1 million borrowers. “Another 160,000 borrowers and their families will get some much-needed relief thanks to the continued efforts the Biden-Harris Administration to fix the broken student loan system,” said U.S. Under Secretary of Education James Kvaal. “We congratulate those borrowers on their due forgiveness and we will continue to work to deliver relief to others.” As discussed in a recent report by the Council of Economic Advisers, the relief provided by these discharges and other actions taken by the Administration could boost short-term consumption and have positive effects on borrower mental health, financial security, and outcomes such as homeownership and entrepreneurship. Borrowers have already begun receiving emails informing them of their approvals. Their relief will be processed in the following weeks. New Plans to Deliver Debt Relief to Tens of Millions of Americans In April, the Biden-Harris Administration released initial details of a new set of plans that would provide student debt relief for tens of millions of borrowers across the country. The plans would bring the total number of borrowers eligible for student debt relief to over 30 million, including borrowers who have already been approved for debt cancellation by the Biden-Harris Administration over the past three years. The plans for new student debt relief regulations announced by President Biden are the next step in a regulatory process that began last summer to provide debt relief to as many borrowers as possible as quickly as possible under the Higher Education Act. The proposals would permit the following types of waivers: Waiving accrued and capitalized interest for millions of borrowers; Automatically discharging debt for borrowers not enrolled in but otherwise eligible for loan forgiveness under the SAVE Plan, closed school discharge, or other forgiveness programs; Eliminating student debt for borrowers who entered repayment 20 or more years ago; Helping borrowers who enrolled in low-financial-value programs or institutions; and Assisting borrowers who experience hardship in paying. Public comments on the first set of plans closed on May 17. The Department is in the process of carefully reviewing comments. Our goal is to publish a final rule that results in delivering relief this fall. A Strong Track Record of Borrower Assistance The Biden-Harris Administration has taken many steps to reduce the burden of student debt and ensure that student loans are not a barrier to opportunity for students and families. The Administration secured a $900 increase to the maximum Pell Grant -- the largest increase in a decade -- and finalized new rules to protect borrowers from career programs that leave graduates with unaffordable debts or insufficient earnings. Beyond the relief under IDR, the SAVE Plan, and PSLF, the Biden-Harris Administration has also approved: $28.7 billion for more than 1.6 million borrowers who were cheated by their schools, saw their institutions precipitously close, or are covered by related court settlements. $14.1 billion for more than 548,000 borrowers with a total and permanent disability The updated state-by-state breakdown of borrowers approved for forgiveness under IDR and the SAVE Plan, including today’s announcement, can be found here ."
16-May-24,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/fact-sheet-biden-%E2%81%A0harris-administration-announces-record-over-16-billion-support-historically-black-colleges-and-universities-hbcus,FACT SHEET: Biden-⁠Harris Administration Announces Record Over $16 Billion in Support for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs),"Today, the Biden-Harris Administration announced a new record in Federal funding and investments in Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) totaling more than $16 billion from Fiscal Years (FY) 2021 through current available data for FY 2024. This new reported total is up from the previously announced over $7 billion , and captures significant additional actions already undertaken. The total of more than $16 billion includes over $11.4 billion between FY2021 and FY2023 through Federal grants, contracting awards, and debt relief for HBCUs; over $4 billion between FY2021 and FY2023 for HBCU-enrolled students through federal financial aid and educational benefits for veterans; and, so far in FY 2024, over $900 million has been secured for Department of Education programs strengthening HBCUs as institutions. President Biden and Vice President Harris are committed to ensuring whole-of-government investment efforts in HBCUs continue at full momentum through the rest of FY 2024. These historic funding levels demonstrate the Administration’s ongoing commitment to HBCUs, which serve as an engine for upward economic mobility in our country. The Administration is also focused on work to ensure HBCUs have the resources to provide a high-quality postsecondary education. For more than 180 years, HBCUs have been advancing intergenerational economic mobility for Black families and communities, developing vital academic research, and making our Nation more prosperous and equitable. Despite representing only 3% of colleges and universities, HBCUs play an outsized role to support the economic mobility of African Americans, producing 40 percent of all Black engineers, 50 percent of all Black teachers, 70 percent of all Black doctors and dentists, 80 percent of all Black judges, and the first woman and Black Vice President of the United States. Overall, HBCUs greatly contribute to the economic success of America, providing college access to twice as many Pell Grant-eligible (low-income) students as non-HBCU institutions. Additionally, social mobility research by the United Negro College Fund finds that HBCUs support nearly five times more students than Ivy League and other top-ranked institutions in facilitating movement from the bottom 40% in U.S. household income to the top 60%. A CEA report published today further underscores that HBCUs are engines for upward mobility and additionally discusses new research showing that HBCU enrollment has considerable positive effects on bachelor’s degree completion and household income later in life. The report details how these successes have occurred in the context of historic underfunding of HBCUs. It also discusses a recent resurgence in applications to, and enrollment in, HBCUs which highlight the high value that students have placed on these institutions in recent years. Since Day One, the Biden-Harris Administration has committed to advancing racial equity , economic opportunity, and educational excellence, including by reestablishing the White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity through Historically Black Colleges and Universities . Between FY 2021 – FY 2023 the Biden-Harris Administration has taken historic actions to support HBCUs: Invested over $11.4 billion in HBCUs, which includes: Nearly $4 billion for HBCUs through the American Rescue Plan and other COVID relief legislation. These grants funded through the Department of Education and other agencies have helped HBCUs support students’ ability to meet basic needs; support campus operations, staffing, teaching, and educational programs; and keep campuses and the surrounding communities on the path to an equitable recovery; $2.6 billion from the Department of Education to build institutional capacity at HBCUs. These efforts support the growth and sustainability of HBCU degree programs; increase and enhance human, technological, and physical infrastructure for research; strengthen positioning to secure direct partnership opportunities; and create sustainable fund development; Over $1.6 billion to HBCUs through Federal grants, cooperative agreements, and other competitive funding opportunities that drive the advancement of academic and training programs, community-based initiatives, and research innovation across national priorities such as medicine and public health, climate science, agriculture, emerging technologies, and defense; Almost $950 million to support HBCUs in growing research capacity and related infrastructure to better compete for Federal research and development dollars; Nearly $719 million in grant funding to expand STEM academic capacity and educational programs; and in other high-wage, high-demand fields such as computer science, nursing, and allied health; Over $150 million in Federal contracting opportunities awarded to HBCUs, including for research and expansion of STEM education programs at the Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Transportation, Department of Energy, and U.S. Agency for International Development; $1.6 billion in capital finance debt relief for 45 public and private HBCUs. Discharging these debts has enabled these institutions to focus resources on supporting students, faculty, and staff while recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic; and Over $2.4 million in Project SERV funds to support HBCUs affected by more than a dozen bomb threats in 2022. These grants have helped restore safe learning environments and invest in student mental health and well-being for students. In addition to the over $11 billion provided to HBCUs, the Biden-Harris Administration has provided over $4 billion to support the success of HBCU-enrolled students through: $2.8 billion in need-based grants and other Federal programs, including Pell Grants, Federal Work-Study and Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants, to assist HBCU students in affording a postsecondary education; and Nearly $1.3 billion to support Veterans attending HBCUs through the GI bill and other college, graduate school, and training programs delivered through the Department of Veterans Affairs. While more must be done to ensure equity for HBCUs and their students, the Biden-Harris Administration is delivering landmark first-of-its-kind results: The Department of Defense U.S. Air Force established the first-ever HBCU-led University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) . Led by Howard University with seven other HBCUs and funded at $90 million over five years, efforts will focus on advancing the deployment of autonomous technologies for Air Force missions. Participating schools include Jackson State University, Tuskegee University, Hampton University, Bowie State University, Norfolk State University, Delaware State University, Florida Memorial University, and Tougaloo College. The Department of Commerce established the first-ever Connecting-Minority-Communities program delivering funding for 43 HBCUs to purchase broadband internet, purchase equipment, and hire IT personnel to tackle the digital divide impacting HBCUs. Several HBCUs also recently launched an HBCU CHIPS Network in collaboration with Georgia Institute of Technology to increase the coordination of the resources at the colleges and universities and jointly contribute to workforce development needs of the semiconductor industry. Chips are critical in powering our consumer electronics, automobiles, data centers, critical infrastructure, and virtually all military systems. The Department of Commerce National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will provide $4.2 million in grant funding to HBCUs, through the EPP/MSI Cooperative Science Center program . The Department of Agriculture announced a $262.5 million investment to support 33 projects across U.S. institutions of higher education designed to train the next generation of diverse agricultural professionals. Through the USDA NextGen program , the projects are led by 1890 land-grant institutions (historically Black land-grant universities), 1994 land-grant institutions (Tribal Colleges and Universities, Alaska Native-Serving Institutions and Native Hawaiian-Serving Institutions, Hispanic-Serving Institutions), and institutions of higher education located in the Insular Areas. This historic investment will provide training and support to more than 20,000 future food and agricultural leaders through 33 projects executed by more than 60 institutions across 24 states and Insular Areas. The Department of Energy announced the inaugural $7.75 million Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) Clean Energy Education Prize , a competition that will support HBCUs in developing programming to strengthen the participation of K-12 and community college students in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields. The competition, which has announced its first 10 winning HBCU teams , is supporting the creation of clean energy community networks to inspire the next generation of students to work in STEM fields related to clean energy. The Department of Education provided nearly $25 million to HBCUs under the Research and Development Infrastructure program to transform their research infrastructure, including strengthening research productivity, faculty expertise, physical infrastructure, and partnerships leading to increases in external funding. The Department of Transportation announced Prairie View A&M University in Texas as the first-ever HBCU to lead a University Transportation Center . Prairie View A&M and 11 other HBCUs were among 34 schools to receive a portion of a $435 million grant for development of interoperable technology systems, which allow equipment, software, and applications to work together, communicate, and exchange data. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is pioneering efforts to close opportunity gaps in STEM, including nearly $12 million for eight HBCUs to support programs in artificial intelligence and machine learning and create a more diverse pipeline of talent for careers in data-intensive space-based Earth science. The White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity through HBCUs established the Executive HBCU Space Lab , a new collaboration between HBCUs, the Federal government, and industry partners to increase HBCU engagement in space-related federal contracting. The Executive HBCU Space Lab is a solutions-oriented initiative that will release resources including SpaceTechConnect, a free platform to highlight space-related capabilities at HBCUs. The Department of Health and Human Services National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences established HBCU-Connect , a new initiative with HBCUs to inspire the development of environmental health science leaders from diverse backgrounds. HBCU-Connect is a multifaceted effort to strengthen ties between the institute and faculty and students at academic institutions that are often underrepresented in the sciences. The Department of Health and Human Services Health Resources and Services Administration’s Maternal and Child Health Bureau launched the Maternal Health Research Collaborative for MSIs , providing roughly $30M in research support to seven HBCUs over five years. The funding will build capacity of HBCUs to conduct Black maternal health research to fully understand and address the root causes of disparities in maternal mortality, severe maternal morbidity, and maternal health outcomes; and to find community-based solutions to address these disparities and advance health equity. The Department of Health and Human Services National Institutes of Health funding to HBCUs totaled $147.5 million to support research, training, research capacity building, and outreach efforts. NIH funding included endowment awards to strengthen the research infrastructure of the HBCU award recipients to conduct minority health and health disparities research. Other NIH funding has assisted several HBCUs in contributing towards building a diverse scientific workforce, including mentorship and student training programs and career development opportunities for faculty. The National Science Foundation launched Advancing Research Capacity at HBCUs through Exploration and Innovation (ARC-HBCU) to support participation in an intensive, facilitated workshop that brings together HBCU faculty, staff, research administrators and academic leadership focused on exploration of innovative and promising approaches for addressing the research capacity needs of HBCUs. The National Science Foundation, as part of Growing Research Access for Nationally Transformative Equity and Diversity (GRANTED) initiative , awarded an Atlanta-based HBCU consortium a $14 million competitive grant to establish a hub that promotes equity in the national research ecosystem and serves as a model for other HBCUs and emerging research institutions. The consortium includes Spelman College, Morehouse College, Morehouse School of Medicine, and Clark Atlanta University. The National Science and Technology Council’s Committee on STEM , in support of the CHIPS and Science Act, established an Interagency Working Group (IWG) on HBCU, TCU, and MSI STEM Achievement. The Council provides a coordinated federal approach to carry out sustained outreach activities to increase clarity, transparency, and accountability for federal research agency investments in STEM education and research at HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs, including such institutions in rural areas. The Department of Housing and Urban Development announced awards totaling $5.5 million for HBCUs to conduct housing and community development research to support the production of affordable housing, support homeownership, advance use of renewable energy, and address infrastructure inequity affecting underserved communities. The Department of Justice has increased both the number of HBCUs applying for grants and its HBCU approval rate. Over the past five years, DOJ's grant awards to HBCUs have increased 83% (from $900,000 in FY18 to $5.2 million to HBCUs in FY23)."
15-May-24,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-allows-borrowers-more-time-consolidate-loans-get-credit-progress-toward-loan-forgiveness-programs,Biden-Harris Administration Allows Borrowers More Time to Consolidate Loans to Get Credit for Progress Toward Loan Forgiveness Programs,"The Biden-Harris Administration today announced an update on the timing of the payment count adjustment. This administrative fix ensures borrowers get proper credit for progress borrowers made toward income-driven repayment (IDR) forgiveness and Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF). The payment count adjustment is now anticipated to be fully implemented in September 2024. At that time, borrowers with Direct Loans or Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program loans held by the U.S. Department of Education (Department) will see a full and accurate count of their progress toward loan forgiveness. Because of this updated timeline, borrowers with non-federally held FFEL loans who apply to consolidate by June 30 can still benefit from the payment count adjustment. The prior consolidation deadline was April 30. “The Department is working swiftly to ensure borrowers get credit for every month they’ve rightfully earned toward forgiveness,” said U.S. Under Secretary of Education James Kvaal. “FFEL borrowers should consolidate as soon as possible in order to receive this benefit that has already provided forgiveness to nearly 1 million borrowers.” The Department first announced the payment count adjustment in April 2022 to address extensive evidence, including from the U.S. Government Accountability Office , that borrowers did not have a proper accounting of their time to forgiveness under IDR plans as well as widespread evidence that servicers had not been properly following regulations and Department contracts governing the use of forbearances, resulting in borrowers spending excessive amounts of time in forbearances. To rectify these problems and ensure an accurate count going forward, the payment count adjustment automatically counts months in the following statuses: • Any months in a repayment status, regardless of the payments made, loan type, or repayment plan; • Twelve or more months of consecutive forbearance or 36 or more months of cumulative forbearance; • Any months spent in economic hardship or military deferments in 2013 or later; • Any months spent in any deferment (with the exception of in-school deferment) prior to 2013; and • Any time in repayment (or deferment or forbearance, if applicable) on earlier loans before consolidation of those loans into a consolidation loan. Borrowers also can receive credit toward PSLF for any month covered by the payment count adjustment as long as they certify their qualifying employment for that month. The Department has already been identifying borrowers eligible for forgiveness under the payment count adjustment so they can get their relief without waiting for the adjustment to finish. Starting in August 2023, the Department began identifying and, following an opt-out period, automatically discharging borrowers whose updated payment counts were sufficient to reach forgiveness after 20 or 25 years of payments, as well as borrowers who reached the required 120 months of repayment and certified employment for PSLF. Borrowers are eligible for IDR forgiveness whether they are currently enrolled in an IDR plan or not, because part of the problem identified was borrowers not getting complete and accurate information that would have allowed them to access IDR. Through this action, the Department has approved $49.2 billion in forgiveness for more than 996,000 borrowers. This number does not include borrowers who received PSLF at least in part due to the account adjustment. While the Department continues to identify borrowers who have reached those forgiveness thresholds, we are still working to implement changes that will give all borrowers an accurate count of their payments. Those changes are now expected to be completed in September instead of July. When the Department finishes processing the account adjustment in September 2024, it will ensure that the adjustment has been applied to any loan held by the Department at that time. The payment count adjustment will be processed automatically for all Direct Loan borrowers without further action on their part. Borrowers with FFEL Program loans held by the Department will also receive the account adjustment automatically but must consolidate into the Direct Loan Program if they want to count any prior time in repayment toward PSLF. Borrowers with any other federal loan type would need to consolidate to Direct Loans to receive the payment count adjustment. That includes borrowers with commercial FFEL loans or any type of Perkins loan. Based upon this updated timeline, borrowers who need to consolidate in order to benefit from the payment count adjustment or count periods toward PSLF must apply to consolidate by June 30. The Department has previously released information about eligibility requirements and how to understand what loans are eligible for this benefit and how to consolidate. Borrowers can also learn more on at StudentAid.gov/idradjustment . Borrowers who aren’t sure what kind of loans they have can find out by logging in to StudentAid.gov. On their dashboard, they can click the “Loan Breakdown” section to view a list of their loans. Direct Loans begin with the word “Direct.” Federal Family Education Loan Program loans begin with “FFEL.” Perkins Loans include the word “Perkins” in the name. If the name of your servicer starts with “Dept.of Ed” or “Default Management Collection System,” your FFEL or Perkins loan is federally managed (i.e., held by the Department). Unwavering commitment to relief The Biden-Harris Administration remains committed to using all available tools to deliver the federal student loan relief that borrowers and their families deserve. In total, the Administration has approved almost $160 billion in relief for nearly 4.6 million borrowers, including: • $62.8 billion in relief for more than 876,000 individuals through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program • $49.2 billion for more than 996,000 borrowers through improvements to IDR that addressed longstanding administrative failure and the misuse of forbearance by loan servicers. • $4.8 billion for almost 360,000 borrowers on the SAVE Plan. These are borrowers who originally took out smaller loans for their postsecondary studies. • $28.7 billion for 1.6 million borrowers who were cheated by their schools, saw their institutions precipitously close, or are covered by related court settlements. • $14.1 billion for more 548,000 borrowers with a total and permanent disability."

Of the 3.7 million students expected to graduate from high school this year, more than 5,700 candidates qualified for the 2024 awards determined by outstanding performance on the College Board SAT or ACT exams or through nominations made by chief state school officers, other partner recognition organizations and YoungArts , the National Foundation for the Advancement of Artists. As directed by Presidential Executive Order, the 2024 U.S. Presidential Scholars are comprised of two students from each state, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, and U.S. families living abroad, as well as 15 chosen at-large, 20 scholars in the arts and 20 scholars in career and technical education. Created in 1964, the U.S. Presidential Scholars Program has honored over 8,200 of the nation's top-performing students. The program was expanded in 1979 to recognize students who demonstrate exceptional talent in the visual, literary and performing arts. In 2015, the program was again extended to recognize students who demonstrate ability and accomplishment in career and technical education fields. 2024 is the program’s 60th anniversary. The Presidential Scholars Class of 2024 will be recognized for their outstanding achievement this summer with an online recognition program.

9-May-24,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/during-mental-health-awareness-month-u-s-department-education-announces-new-actions-increase-access-school-based-mental-health-services,"During Mental Health Awareness Month, U. S. Department of Education Announces New Actions to Increase Access to School-Based Mental Health Services","Today, during Mental Health Awareness Month, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing new actions to increase access to school-based mental health services, including: (1) nearly doubling investments in the U.S. Department of Education’s (Department’s) School-Based Mental Health Services (SBMH) and Mental Health Service Professionals (MHSP) grant programs in the current Fiscal Year; (2) making additional investments through the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA) to improve the mental health and wellbeing of students and educators; and (3) offering new mental health and wellbeing trainings and resources for schools and educators. “Today’s announcements affirm the Biden-Harris Administration’s continued commitment to tackling our youth mental health crisis,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “We know students are more likely to access mental health support if it’s offered in schools. By nearly doubling funds this year for school-based mental health professionals, releasing additional funds to help advance a variety of mental health strategies, and providing additional training and resources, we are raising the bar for student wellbeing across the country.” Our nation’s schools serve as a critical access point to mental health services that could otherwise be out of reach for students. Students are six times more likely to receive mental health services when they are delivered at school. That is because schools are often best positioned to provide access and reach large numbers of students through education, prevention, services, and early intervention efforts, and can help to reduce stigmatization that might be associated with seeking services. Improving youth mental health is a key component of the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to improving student wellbeing and outcomes: when young people have access to the mental health care that they need and deserve, they’re more likely to learn, develop, and achieve, and to build important connections with peers and caring adults. Thanks to President Biden’s work to pass and sign the American Rescue Plan (ARP) and BSCA, and as a core component of the President’s Unity Agenda , students have increased access to vital services and are more likely to have a counselor, social worker, or nurse at their school than when the President took office. The Department has worked closely with federal, state, and local government agencies, as well as colleges and universities, to build K-12 school-based capacity to provide mental health services and work toward accomplishing the goal set out by the President to double the number of school counselors, social workers, and other school-based mental health professionals. Additionally, Biden-Harris Administration investments have opened the door for colleges and universities to train more school-based mental health professionals who can work with students and increase the diversity of the profession; for schools to hire and retain mental health professionals and provide school-based services; and for schools to access additional funding through the Medicaid program to support school health services, including mental health services. Today, we are announcing three additional actions that build on this Administration’s efforts to make mental health services more available and accessible to children and youth. Today’s actions include: 1. Nearly doubling the amount of funding available in the current Fiscal Year for the School-Based Mental Health (SBMH) and the Mental Health Service Professional (MHSP) grant programs—and giving states, school districts, and institutions of higher education additional time to apply. Earlier this year, the Department released Notices Inviting Applications (NIA s ) for the SBMH and MHSP programs totaling a $38 million investment across both programs. Following the passage of the final Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill, the Department will now allocate an additional $32 million toward these two critical programs – bringing the new total funding available to states, local educational agencies, and institutions of higher education for school-based mental health efforts up to $70 million. In addition to increasing available funding, the Department has extended the application windows for both programs until May 31, 2024, so they remain open throughout the entirety of Mental Health Awareness Month. This $70 million investment in FY 2024 builds on the $571 million in awards already made in these programs through Department appropriations and the largest-ever expansion of K-12 mental health programs through BSCA. To date, the Biden-Harris Administration has made awards to 264 grantees across 48 states and territories to strengthen the pipeline and increase the number and diversity of school-based mental health professionals—with funding projected to help train and hire an additional 14,000 mental health professionals to support students and address their mental health needs. NIAs, which outline requirements to apply, have been posted to the Federal Register. Applications for SBMH and MHSP are due on May 31, 2024. 2. Releasing additional BSCA funding to improve the mental health and wellbeing of students and educators. BSCA provided $1 billion for states to invest in improving school climate and safety and supporting student mental health and well-being in underserved schools through the Stronger Connections Grant program. This funding is making schools safer and more welcoming for students using a variety of strategies, including school-based mental health services, as well as safety and community violence prevention and intervention programs. BSCA also contained a 2% set-aside for technical assistance and capacity building for states to help administer and advance the objectives of the Stronger Connections Grant program. In the coming weeks, the Department will release a notice for states to apply for this remaining BSCA funding which can be used to strengthen mental health, such as efforts to improve mental health for our youngest learners and for educators. This funding will help states and schools better leverage their existing Stronger Connections Grant investment to have more impact for more students. 3. Providing additional trainings and resources for youth mental health through Departments of Education and Health and Human Services Technical Assistance Centers. Throughout Mental Health Awareness Month, the Department's technical assistance centers are sharing resources and information to support state and local mental health efforts. Each week will be dedicated to sharing resources on a different topic: (1) Educator mental health and wellbeing, timed with Teacher Appreciation Week; (2) the Department’s Free to Learn initiative to prevent violence, hate, and harassment; (3) Mental health and Medicaid resources for schools; and (4) Creating safe and healthy learning environments. More information about upcoming events on mental health can be found on the Department’s Best Practices Clearinghouse calendar ; and additional resources, including toolkits and reports from the Department's technical assistance centers, can be found in the resource library . In addition to these resources, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released a new communications toolkit and is carrying out an array of technical assistance offerings throughout the month of May. The toolkit features resources on how to support children and youth with developing self-care strategies and skills for managing life stressors in healthy ways. The Departments of Education and Health and Human Services will continue to work together to increase access to critical health care services, especially mental health services, for millions of students across the nation. President Biden named tackling the mental health crisis a key pillar in his Unity Agenda for the nation because its an issue that we can all come together to advance. And, since day one of his Administration, President Biden has been clear that we must invest in the mental health and wellbeing of every student. The Department will continue to advance this mission by making the pathway into mental health professions more accessible; increasing the number and diversity of school-based mental health professionals; expanding the number of full-service community schools , increasing partnerships with community-based organizations to provide school-based mental health supports and community violence interventions, and reducing the stigmatization and shame that young people often associate with seeking help."

This letter comes as President Biden is delivering remarks today about antisemitism at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum’s Days of Remembrance commemoration. “I continue to be deeply concerned by the repeated reports of antisemitic and anti-Israeli, anti-Muslim, anti-Arab, and anti-Palestinian harassment on our campuses and in our communities. These incidents are abhorrent, period. There is nothing more important than making sure students feel safe on campus,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “The Administration will continue to develop and provide resources and support to ensure safe, supportive school environments. The Department will investigate and address any possible discrimination that causes harm to students and we will continue to remind schools of their responsibilities to enforce Title IV.” This Dear Colleague Letter is the latest in a series of recent guidance documents on this topic and a key component of the Biden-Harris Administration’s U.S. National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism and the forthcoming National Strategy to Counter Islamophobia and Related Forms of Bias and Discrimination . On Friday, Secretary Cardona sent a letter to all college and university presidents offering resources and guidance in the midst of increased antisemitism and widespread college protests on campus. Today’s letter provides information on the legal analyses that OCR uses to determine whether discrimination exists, and it provides examples of conduct that, depending on facts and circumstances, could raise concerns under Title VI and its implementing regulations. Schools that receive federal financial assistance from the Department have a legal responsibility to address discrimination against students, including Jewish, Israeli, Muslim, Arab, Sikh, South Asian, Hindu, and Palestinian students, when the discrimination involves racial, ethnic, or ancestral slurs or stereotypes; is based on a student’s skin color, physical features, or style of dress that reflects both ethnic and religious traditions; or is based on the country or region where a student is from or is perceived to have come from, including, for example, discrimination based on a student’s accent or name, a student’s limited English proficiency, or a student speaking a language other than English. “OCR designed this resource to help school communities know how to ensure every student has equal access to education without a hostile environment based on negative stereotypes or bias about where their families come from,” said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon. In addition to today’s letter, OCR has issued other resources to support schools in complying with their obligations under Title VI. These resources include: Dear Colleague Letter: Addressing Discrimination Against Jewish Students . Dear Colleague Letter on Addressing Discrimination Against Muslim, Arab, Sikh, South Asian, Hindu, and Palestinian Students . Dear Colleague Letter: Discrimination, including Harassment, Based on Shared Ancestry or Ethnic Characteristics Fact Sheet Protecting Students from Discrimination Based on Shared Ancestry or Ethnic Characteristics . These resources are available on the Shared Ancestry or Ethnic Characteristics page of OCR’s website. Information about recently resolved complaints under Title VI, including complaints alleging discrimination based on shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics, is available here . Anyone who believes that a school has discriminated against a student based on race, color, or national origin can file a complaint of discrimination with OCR. To file a complaint, visit https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/complaintintro.html . OCR is available to provide technical assistance on the application of Title VI to discrimination based on race, color, or national origin as described in the letter released today.

6-May-24,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-launches-next-phase-fafsa-support-strategy-boost-completion-rate-among-high-school-students,U.S. Department of Education Launches Next Phase of FAFSA Support Strategy to Boost Completion Rate Among High School Students,"The U.S. Department of Education (Department) today announced additional steps to support students and their families with the Better FAFSA. The Department is launching a multi-million-dollar program as part of the FAFSA Student Support Strategy to help school districts, state, nonprofits and other public and private organizations with efforts to boost FAFSA completion. Since the new 2024–25 FAFSA form became available on Dec. 30, more than 8.95 million forms have been successfully submitted. The FAFSA Student Support Strategy funds will help grow capacity for organizations to expand the availability of advisers, counselors, and coaches to support students and contributors through the FAFSA applications, including during extended hours through evenings, weekends, and the summer weeks. It will also facilitate FAFSA submission clinics, including through partnerships with schools and districts, and provide transportation support as needed. Additionally, these funds will provide communication supports to help organizations communicate with parents and students via text, phone calls, and videoconferences, in multiple languages as needed, to help them complete their forms. The FAFSA Student Support Strategy aims to continue increasing the number of high school students who complete a 2024-25 FAFSA and enroll in college, particularly first-time college students and students of color. This investment builds on the Department’s efforts to help students, families, and institutions through the 2024-25 FAFSA application cycle, in addition to the College Support Strategy , the FAFSA Fast Break campaign, and direct communication efforts with institutions and stakeholders via the FAFSA Fast News blog . Over the past few months, the Department has sent approximately 70 million emails to students encouraging them to complete the Better FAFSA form, as well as engaged with hundreds of superintendents and principals to help drive submission efforts, garnering over 200 commitments from companies, non-profits, and community organizations to help boost FAFSA submissions. Last week, the Department kicked-off a series of regional and local media engagement in media markets across the country to drive awareness and increase completion rates, targeting states with the largest high school senior FAFSA submission gaps. “We are determined to close the FAFSA completion gap,” said U.S. Deputy Secretary of Education Cindy Marten. “The funding we’re announcing today will support states, districts, and community-based groups build capacity and leverage their power to ensure that every student who needs help paying for college turns in their FAFSA form.” The program will provide up to $50 million for grantees and will be implemented by ECMC to support organizations with demonstrated experience expanding college access and enrollment. The funding will be prioritized for organizations currently working with schools and districts, and those that have deep ties with students and families which have the reach and capacity to help decrease barriers and increase FAFSA submissions. The Department continues to create and share resources for schools, students, families, and institutions of higher education to ensure they have the tools and information they need to receive and award financial aid. More information can be found at Ed.gov/better-FAFSA. This announcement comes as the Department has made significant progress to address known issues with the 2024-25 FAFSA form and transmitted the Institutional Student Information Records (ISIRs) from more than 8.95 million applications to schools, states, and designated scholarship organizations. Most four-year institutions are now sending student aid offers, including the vast majority of schools with upcoming admissions deadlines."
1-May-24,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/white-house-honors-national-teachers-year-state-dinner-biden-harris-administration-releases-new-data-public-service-loan-forgiveness-approvals-every-congressional-district,"As White House Honors National Teachers of the Year at State Dinner, Biden-Harris Administration Releases New Data on Public Service Loan Forgiveness Approvals in Every Congressional District","The Biden-Harris Administration today released new data showing the breakdown of borrowers approved for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) by Congressional District. The data showcase how every district across the country has borrowers that are part of the 876,000 individuals who have been approved for $62.8 billion in relief through this program. By contrast, at the start of this Administration only 7,000 had been approved for PSLF. The data released today come as the White House prepares to host the first-ever State dinner to honor the 2024 National Teacher of the Year and State Teachers of the Year from across the country. “As we honor our nation’s teachers, we also celebrate the Biden-Harris Administration’s historic work to help ease the burden of student loans for educators as well as for nurses, firefighters, and other public service workers in every single part of the country,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “The data show that much-needed student loan relief is available for public servants no matter where they live—rural or urban, on the coast or in the heartland, and in every congressional district.” The approvals contained in the data are representative of the Administration’s unceasing efforts to fix the broken student loan system and restore the promise of discharge programs. The Administration has helped fix longstanding problems with PSLF through the limited PSLF waiver, while the payment count adjustment has also ensured that borrowers get accurate counts of progress toward forgiveness. Last year, the U.S. Department of Education (Education) also implemented new regulations designed to make it easier for borrowers to qualify for PSLF. The data show that on average, more than 1,200 borrowers in each district have been approved for $87 million in relief. Every district has been approved for at least $1 million in relief. Outside of the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, the districts with the largest number of approved borrowers are New York’s 20th, Maryland’s 5th, Virginia’s 8th, New York’s 25th, and Florida’s 2nd. Unwavering commitment to relief The Biden-Harris Administration remains committed to using all available tools to deliver the federal student loan relief that borrowers and their families deserve. In total, the Administration has approved almost $160 billion in relief for nearly 4.6 million borrowers, including: $49.2 billion for more than 996,000 borrowers through improvements to IDR that addressed longstanding administrative failure and the misuse of forbearance by loan servicers. $4.8 billion for almost 360,000 borrowers on the SAVE Plan. These are borrowers who originally took out smaller loans for their postsecondary studies. $28.7 billion for 1.6 million borrowers who were cheated by their schools, saw their institutions precipitously close, or are covered by related court settlements. $14.1 billion for more 548,000 borrowers with a total and permanent disability. The Department is also working on new regulations to provide debt relief to as many borrowers as possible as quickly as possible. Those draft rules are currently out for public comment through May 17."
1-May-24,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-approves-61-billion-group-student-loan-discharge-317000-borrowers-who-attended-art-institutes,"Biden-Harris Administration Approves $6.1 Billion Group Student Loan Discharge for 317,000 Borrowers Who Attended The Art Institutes","The Biden-Harris Administration today announced the approval of more than $6.1 billion in automatic student loan relief to nearly 317,000 borrowers who enrolled at any Art Institute campus on or after Jan. 1, 2004, through Oct. 16, 2017. The U.S. Department of Education (Department) found that The Art Institutes and its parent company, Education Management Corporation (EDMC), made pervasive and substantial misrepresentations to prospective students about postgraduation employment rates, salaries, and career services during that time. In October 2017, EDMC sold its remaining Art Institute campuses, and all existing Art Institute campuses closed under separate ownership in September 2023. Today's action brings the total amount of student relief approved by the Biden-Harris Administration to almost $160 billion for nearly 4.6 million borrowers. ""For more than a decade, hundreds of thousands of hopeful students borrowed billions to attend The Art Institutes and got little but lies in return. That ends today—thanks to the Biden-Harris Administration's work with the attorneys general offices of Iowa, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""We must continue to protect borrowers from predatory institutions—and work toward a higher education system that is affordable to students and taxpayers."" The Department independently reviewed evidence provided by the attorneys general offices of Iowa, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania, which conducted multi-year investigations into, and brought lawsuits against, The Art Institutes and EDMC. The attorneys general of Pennsylvania and Iowa provided materials obtained from investigations into these entities, including internal employment data, admissions training manuals, and the school's employment advertisements. The Massachusetts attorney general provided information obtained during an investigation into the New England Institute of Art—the Massachusetts Art Institute campus—including internal employment verification forms, other internal records of graduate employment outcomes, advertisements, and statements from former students and employees. Today's announcement is another example of the strong partnerships between the Department and state attorneys general and their shared commitment to protecting federal student loan borrowers from predatory schools. ""The Art Institutes preyed on the hopes of students attempting to better their lives through education,"" said Federal Student Aid Chief Operating Officer Richard Cordray. ""We cannot replace the time stolen from these students, but we can lift the burden of their debt. We remain committed to working with our federal and state partners to protect borrowers."" About the findings Based on the evidence, the Department found that The Art Institutes engaged in widespread and pervasive substantial misrepresentations that deceived students about the value they would be receiving from their education: The Art Institutes advertised that more than 80 percent of graduates obtained employment related their fields of study within six months of graduation, but the school's own records demonstrate that it inflated advertised employment rates. For example, The Art Institutes counted graduates as employed in-field when the school did not know graduates' job titles, when a graduate's job title was too vague to indicate that they worked in-field, and when a graduate's job title was unrelated to their field of study. The school also excluded some graduates with out-of-field jobs from their calculations to inflate their in-field employment rates. When recalculated to account for these issues, The Art Institutes' average in-field employment rate dropped from 82 percent to no higher than 57 percent, 25 percentage points lower than advertised. The true average in-field employment rate was lower than 57 percent because the school also falsified some internal data to make graduates appear to be working in-field when they were not. The advertisements promoting The Art Institutes' falsified employment rates also displayed inaccurate average salaries that graduates earned from their in-field positions based on the same flawed data as the employment rates. Testimony from former high-raking school officials supported the findings that school personnel made up graduate earnings and annualized the actual or estimated incomes of graduates working in temporary positions. They also included high-earning outliers in its averages and falsified incomes reported for graduates. For example, according to a former employee, one Art Institute campus included professional tennis player Serena Williams' annual income to ""skew the statistics and overinflate potential program salaries."" Another former employee described witnessing a coworker use salary.com to determine that a graduate's salary was $25,000, when the graduate reported earning only $8,000 a year. The Art Institutes also represented to prospective students that it had partnerships with employers and offered ongoing postgraduation career services. However, the evidence showed that The Art Institutes exaggerated its relationships with employers. In fact, the school had a negative reputation, so companies generally did not want to hire its graduates. Former employees and borrowers also described that graduates did not have access to ongoing career services after leaving school. For example, once students graduated, school staff did not return their phone calls. The Art Institutes communicated these substantial misrepresentations to prospective students through its website and print materials, and school personnel distributed misleading information to prospective students before and during the admissions process. The school's misconduct harmed borrowers by burdening them with high amounts of debt without the advertised employment opportunities or salaries necessary to pay. Many Art Institute borrowers also dropped out of their programs and defaulted on their loan payments. Even if borrowers did complete their programs, they did not receive the promised career services, which hindered their ability to obtain employment. Next steps This group discharge will provide relief automatically to borrowers harmed by The Art Institutes' actions, including borrowers who have not yet applied for borrower defense. The Department will begin notifying eligible borrowers today that they are approved for discharges. Borrowers do not need to take any action. The Department will take immediate steps to pause loans identified for discharge so borrowers do not make further payments. This ensures that they will not face any further financial demands from these loans during the time needed to process their discharges. When their discharges are processed, borrowers will see any remaining loan balances adjusted and credit trade lines deleted. Payments borrowers made to the Department on their related federal student loans will also be refunded. Borrowers who want to learn more about borrower defense can do so at StudentAid.gov/borrower-defense . Unwavering commitment to relief The Biden-Harris Administration remains committed to using all available tools to deliver the federal student loan relief that borrowers and their families deserve. In total, the Administration has approved almost $160 billion in relief for nearly 4.6 million borrowers, including: $49.2 billion for more than 996,000 borrowers through improvements to IDR that addressed longstanding administrative failure and the misuse of forbearance by loan servicers. $62.8 billion in forgiveness for almost 876,000 borrowers through fixes to PSLF. $4.8 billion for almost 360,000 borrowers on the SAVE Plan. These are borrowers who originally took out smaller loans for their postsecondary studies. $28.7 billion for 1.6 million borrowers who were cheated by their schools, saw their institutions precipitously close, or are covered by related court settlements. $14.1 billion for more 548,000 borrowers with a total and permanent disability."
30-Apr-24,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-completes-processing-fafsa-forms-impacted-known-issues-outlines-push-expand-application-submissions,"U.S. Department of Education Completes Processing for FAFSA Forms Impacted by Known Issues, Outlines Push to Expand Application Submissions","The U.S. Department of Education (Department) announced that it has completed reprocessing 2024–25 Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA®) forms impacted by known issues with IRS data, which should enable all institutions to package financial aid offers. The Department also announced changes to allow applicants and contributors without a Social Security number (SSN) to immediately access and submit the online form. These actions coincide with a national outreach campaign to continue increasing completion rates. The Department is committed to providing schools, organizations, students, and families with the support and resources they need to access the new FAFSA form and pursue their higher education goals. To date, the Department has processed more than 8.3 million FAFSA forms and is encouraging schools to package aid offers as quickly as possible. “After the progress we’ve made in recent weeks, we are now processing FAFSA forms quickly and accurately, and many schools are sending out financial aid offers,” said U.S. Under Secretary of Education James Kvaal, “It’s time for schools to package and send aid offers, and for all new and returning students considering going to college this fall to come to StudentAid.gov and complete a Better FAFSA. The Department’s top priority is to bring higher education more in reach for more students, and we know that the better FAFSA can help unlock those opportunities.” Reprocessing and Student Corrections The Department completed reprocessing FAFSA forms impacted by known issues with the FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX) and has now transmitted the Institutional Student Information Records (ISIRs) from more than 8.3 million FAFSA forms to schools, states, and designated scholarship organizations. In addition, nearly one million corrections have been successfully processed, addressing the most common issues with FAFSA submission. Whether resulting from a new submission or a correction, applicants’ ISIRs are now being sent to schools and states within one to three days of submission. The Department has now delivered the reprocessed ISIRs of nearly all impacted records to institutions and states. The completion of reprocessing of FAFSA forms affected by known issues with both the FA-DDX and FAFSA Processing System should enable all institutions to package aid offers, including those institutions who chose to wait for all reprocessed records prior to proceeding. The Department is also emailing applicants and their contributors who still need to make a correction to the form or have started but not completed their form. Individuals without a Social Security number Applicants and contributors without a Social Security number (SSN) can immediately access the online FAFSA form and submit the form after creating a StudentAid.gov account. The Department is temporarily allowing individuals without an SSN to enter and complete the FAFSA form. Students and contributors must manually enter their tax information. Students without an SSN must verify their eligible noncitizen status through their school before they receive any federal funds. These changes streamline the process for students who have contributors without an SSN to complete their FAFSA form. This temporary allowance for those individuals without an SSN, to enter and complete the FAFSA form, will only be available until the IRS data retrieval issues for those without an SSN are resolved. The Department is working on a resolution and will share an update as soon as possible. The Department will continue to work expeditiously to complete the manual validation process for those without an SSN. The Department is committed to ensuring that all students and families, regardless of their background can equitably access the FAFSA form. View the guidance to schools, states, and other financial aid partners with further information here . Expand Regional and Local Outreach This week, the Department will kick-off a series of regional and local media engagement in media markets across the country to drive awareness and increase FAFSA completion rates. The Department is targeting states with the largest high school senior FAFSA submission gaps. The first regional press call will be held today and will include Arizona, California, Nevada, and Texas. Today's outreach is part of the Department’s national efforts to engage new and returning students to complete the 2024–25 FAFSA form.The Department is encouraging states and schools to continue their outreach to these students, as well as to admitted students who have not yet submitted a FAFSA form. There is also a sizeable number of students who have started, but not yet submitted, their FAFSA form. The Department is reaching out to these students and their contributors on a weekly basis to encourage them to complete their application."
26-Apr-24,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/2024-us-department-education-green-ribbon-schools-announced,2024 U.S. Department of Education Green Ribbon Schools Announced,"The U.S. Department of Education today announced the 2024 U.S. Department of Education Green Ribbon Schools, District Sustainability Awardees, and Postsecondary Sustainability Awardees. Across the country, 41 schools, 10 districts, three postsecondary institutions, and one early learning center are being honored for their innovative efforts to reduce environmental impact and utility costs, improve health and wellness, and offer effective sustainability education. The honorees were named from a pool of candidates nominated by 24 states. Half of this year’s honorees are located in underserved communities. In addition, one state education official is recognized with the Director’s Award. This year, it is George Garcia of the California Department of Education. “This year’s U.S. Department of Education Green Ribbon Schools are leading school transformation in states that will help ensure all students in all communities have the opportunity to grow to become strong and healthy learners,” stated U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “This year’s awardees range from early learning centers to postsecondary institutions. Notably, half are located in under-resourced communities. These awards represent thousands of students, and countless hours of hard work in schools and on college campuses, ensuring equitable access to healthy, climate-resilient learning environments where students are prepared for the sustainability challenges of the present and future.” This announcement comes as the White House hosts the first-ever Summit for Sustainable and Healthy K-12 School Buildings and Grounds from 1-3:30 p.m. ET today. Public and press may tune into the livestream of the program, which will highlight the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to equitable access to energy efficient, climate resilient, and healthy school facilities that are conducive to learning and well-being. The summit brings attention to the pressing need for equitable access to sustainable, 21st century school infrastructure and the impact facilities condition has on student health, overall well-being, and learning outcomes. It also shares federal tools and commitments that bolster sustainable school buildings and infrastructure.

He undertook the work of fixing the broken student loan system programs like Public Service Loan Forgiveness and Income Driven Repayment, identifying 4 million borrowers who were eligible for loan forgiveness. He oversaw the development and implementation of the SAVE Plan, the most affordable way to repay your loans ever. He revitalized the FSA Enforcement Unit to hold schools accountable for cheating students and combated student loan scams. It’s no exaggeration to say that Rich helped change millions of lives for the better. “Rich will conclude his tenure at FSA at the end of June and will serve as Chief Operating Officer until then, in order to oversee the completion of key priorities within the organization. As his consequential tenure comes to an end, we thank Rich for his tireless work and commitment to provide the service that our students, families, and institutions deserve.”"
25-Apr-24,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-educations-office-civil-rights-announces-resolution-sexual-harassment-compliance-review-redlands-unified-school-district-california,U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights Announces Resolution of Sexual Harassment Compliance Review of Redlands Unified School District in California,"The U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) announced today that the Redlands Unified School District in California has entered into a resolution agreement to remedy violations OCR found of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 regarding district responses to notice of sexual assault and other sexual harassment of its students, including by employees. OCR determined that the district had no system in place to monitor whether schools’ responses complied with Title IX requirements or to identify emergent patterns or systemic problems either by school or districtwide. In fully 74% of the incidents OCR reviewed over three school years, the district did not provide any evidence that the district took action to address the effects of harassing conduct on targeted students where necessary and to prevent recurrence of the harassment. In addition, OCR found that the district failed to investigate or redress employee-to-student and student-to-student sexual assault allegations after they were reported to law enforcement or other state agencies, leaving affected students vulnerable to the discrimination that Title IX prohibits but that law enforcement does not address. Likewise, the district did not complete or take required investigative steps in other reported employee-to-student and student-to-student cases. For just one example, after receiving a student allegation that the student witnessed a sexual relationship between an employee and another student for about a year that included the sharing of nude photographs via social media, the district confirmed the sexual relationship and therefore found that the employee violated district policies about professionalism and boundaries. But the district failed even to determine if the relationship or sharing nude photos constituted sexual harassment and allowed the employee to resign without investigating if the conduct created a hostile environment for the student or other students who knew about the relationship. OCR also identified a compliance concern that the district’s recordkeeping system to track incidents of sexual harassment in the 2017-18 through 2019-20 school years appears not to have complied with the Title IX regulations. For example, the district reported only three sexual assaults for OCR’s 2017-18 Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC), but then reported nine sexual assaults during that same year in this compliance review. OCR also found that the district failed to establish a recordkeeping system that complies with the 2020 Title IX regulations. The district agreed to resolve the Title IX violations and concern that OCR identified in a resolution agreement to ensure nondiscrimination on the basis of sex in its schools. “The Redlands Unified School District failed to fulfill its Title IX obligations to promptly and effectively respond to reported sexual assaults of its students by employees as well as by students,” said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon. “The district commitments today promise, finally, that these students may expect the safe, nondiscriminatory learning environment that federal law guarantees for them.” The resolution agreement includes: Ensuring that the district coordinates its Title IX compliance through its Title IX coordinator. Notifying students, parents, and employees of its designated Title IX coordinator(s). Assessing the effectiveness of the district’s Title IX anti-discrimination efforts. Revising, as necessary, Title IX policies and procedures to comply with the Title IX regulations. Training staff and students regarding the district’s revised Title IX procedures, how to identify what constitutes sexual harassment, and how to report such harassment. Improving its recordkeeping system to maintain required records of reports and complaints of sexual harassment and to report complete and accurate data to the CRDC. Administering an annual school climate survey to district employees and students to evaluate the climate at each district school with respect to sexual harassment and to identify responsive steps in light of the survey results for OCR’s review and approval. Reviewing case files for reported incidents of employee-to-student and student-to-student sexual harassment from school years 2017-2018 through 2019-2020 to determine if further action is needed to provide an equitable resolution of each incident. And, Reporting to OCR on its responses to reports and complaints of sexual harassment. The letter to Redlands Unified School District and the resolution agreement are available on the OCR website ."
24-Apr-24,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-create-new-national-recognition-program-institutions-increase-economic-mobility,Biden-Harris Administration to Create New National Recognition Program for Institutions that Increase Economic Mobility,"U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona today will announce at the U.S. Department of Education’s (Department) Attaining College Excellence and Equity Summit the release of a Request for Information (RFI) to develop a new Postsecondary Student Success Recognition Program that will uplift institutions of higher education that support all students to complete affordable credentials of value that prepare them for success. Members of the public will have 30 days to submit suggestions to the Department about this new annual recognition program. The summit is part of the Department’s Raise the Bar initiative which aims to increase postsecondary completion rates, close completion gaps, and ensure all students earn credentials of value. This summit is focused on supporting the whole student to succeed through evidence-based policies and strategies that improve completion such as holistic advising and wraparound services. Nearly 200 leaders will participate in the summit where they will learn about increasing student success, integrating wraparound supports into holistic advising, and guiding students to career success beyond completion among other topics. More information on the summit can be found here . “Imagine a world where schools with the most Pell Grant recipients are ranked highest in U.S. News and World Report, where ‘prestige’ is defined by preparing graduates well to enter the workforce and lead fulfilling lives and careers—sometimes right in their own communities. Imagine universities raising the bar for access and equity becoming household names. This award seeks to make that world possible,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona today in his remarks. “Instead of giving schools high marks for the number of students they turn down, we want to recognize schools doing the most to lift students up.” The Department is requesting insights from the field to better understand institutions’ efforts to promote student success and economic mobility to help evaluate and select institutions to receive the recognition. This includes information about which metrics the Department should use for eligibility and selection for the award, how institutions use data to drive success efforts, how institutions can demonstrate an intentional, scaled, and sustainable commitment to supporting student success, and how institutions evaluate the effectiveness of their student success and economic mobility strategies and policies. For this recognition program, the Department aims to promote a more inclusive definition of student success that includes providing access to an affordable education including to underserved populations, supporting students through to completion of credentials of value, and helping students navigate to career pathways that improve their lives through economic opportunity and mobility. Since day one, the Biden-Harris Administration has been committed to a new vision of college excellence that promotes economic mobility in order to grow America's middle class and strengthen our nation's global competitiveness. The Department will release an application later this year which will allow eligible institutions the opportunity to submit additional quantitative data and qualitative information about how they use data and evidence-based practices as part of an intentional, campus-wide strategy to ensure all students are earning credentials of value, including underrepresented students. The Department currently plans to announce the award in early 2025. The RFI and additional information on submitting comments can be found here ."
23-Apr-24,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/illinoiss-mario-diaz-albarran-named-2024-%E2%80%98recognizing-inspiring-school-employees%E2%80%99-rise-honoree,Illinois’s Mario Diaz Albarran Named 2024 ‘Recognizing Inspiring School Employees’ (RISE) Honoree,"U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona announced today the selection of Mario Diaz Albarran, head custodian at Lincoln Elementary School in Palatine, Illinois, as the 2024 Recognizing Inspiring School Employees ( RISE ) honoree. This honor, established by Congress in 2019, spotlights classified school employees’ outstanding contributions to quality PreK-12 education in the United States. Classified school employees include paraprofessionals, clerical and administrative services, transportation services, food and nutrition services, custodial and maintenance services, security services, health and student services, technical services, and skilled trades professionals. They offer essential services to the school community and play a vital role in providing for the welfare, safety, and success of students. “Across the country, our school professionals are education heroes who meet students’ most fundamental needs and enable our young people to learn, achieve, and thrive,” stated U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “I am thrilled to announce Mr. Mario Diaz Albarran as this year’s RISE awardee. Through Mr. Diaz Albarran’s work, he not only is ensuring that Lincoln Elementary School is a healthy and safe place for learning, he also is building invaluable relationships with students that truly make a difference. It’s an honor for me to recognize Mr. Diaz Albarran with this year’s award. “Mr. Diaz Albarran has created a vivid and empowering environment for students and teachers at Lincoln Elementary School,” said Governor JB Pritzker. “He is changing lives through art and mentorship, and I am thrilled to congratulate him on this incredible honor.” “We are incredibly proud that Mario Diaz Albarran, Illinois’ RISE Award nominee, has been chosen for this prestigious national honor,” said Illinois State Superintendent Dr. Tony Sanders. “He represents the high caliber of dedication and excellence seen in school professionals throughout Illinois. They’re the ones who keep everything running smoothly, from the moment our kids step onto the bus to the last bell of the day. Thank you to Mario and all our classified employees across the state for your invaluable contributions to ensure our students feel safe, supported, and ready to learn every single day.” “We could not be more proud of Mario Diaz Albarran on this truly remarkable achievement. Mario’s dedication, hard work, and commitment to the students and staff at Lincoln School exemplify the values we strive for as a school community. On behalf of the Board of Education and I, we extend our sincere gratitude for his commitment to District 15 and the school in which he so deeply, literally and figuratively, cares for,” said Superintendent Dr. Laurie Heinz, Community Consolidated School District 15. “Mario’s childhood experiences have helped him connect with students, serve as a role model, and embody our shared belief that all students can achieve anything they set their minds to. We are truly lucky to have such an inspiring individual in our school and district. Congratulations, Mario. We knew you were a rising star and now the whole country does as well.” As Head Custodian, Diaz Albarran is known for his dedication, attention to detail, and connections with students and staff alike at Lincoln Elementary in Palatine’s Community Consolidated School District 15. His impact can be seen throughout campus where he's brightened up the walls with school colors and murals that display schoolwide goals. He also makes sure the school is spotless and teachers have everything they need to start each new school year and school day. Back when he was a student in District 15, Diaz Albarran recalls struggling with social and peer issues and feeling pressured to get involved with groups that were not serving his best interests. These days he has a group of “student helpers” who volunteer to assist him with daily maintenance tasks. Students in Lincoln’s STAR (Social Emotional, Trauma Informed Practices, Academic Achievement, Relationships and Character Building) program are eager to earn time to serve as one of his “helpers” as a reward for positive behavior. He uses that time to check in on them, connect, and give guidance wherever they need help. One of these helpers, seventh grader Daniel Aguierre explains how he benefits from his time with Mr. Diaz Albarran. “Sometimes I get really angry so Mr. Diaz has taught me how I can control my anger. Mr. Diaz shared his own life stories so that I could learn from them and not make the same mistakes,” Daniel says. “He teaches me to stop and think and walk away when I'm mad.” Diaz Albarran takes to heart the proverb “It takes a village to raise a child.” He has set the bar high for other classified employees and encourages them to strive to go above and beyond the school walls by helping build student’s character and preparing them emotionally for the real world – all while pouring from his experience and being an example. Today, we celebrate Diaz Albarran for his purposeful work of going above and beyond his call of duty and helping every person with whom he has a daily encounter within his district. Selections such as Mario Diaz Albarran’s began in April 2019 when Congress passed the Recognizing Achievement in Classified School Employees Act , which states, “Prior to May 31 of each year… the Secretary shall select a classified school employee to receive the Recognizing Inspiring School Employees Award for the year.” For the fourth annual competition, the Education Department received 27 nominations from 15 states. Each nomination was peer reviewed, and five finalists were forwarded to the Secretary for consideration. Governors’ offices determined their state-specific process for selecting up to two nominees. For the 2024-2025 school year, the names of nominees must be submitted by Nov. 1, along with documentation showcasing excellence in the following areas: (A) Work performance; (B) School and community involvement; (C) Leadership and commitment; (D) Local support (from co-workers, school administrators, community members, etc., who speak to the nominee’s exemplary work); and (E) Enhancement of classified school employees' image in the community and schools. Individuals interested in nominating for the 2024-2025 school year should contact their Governor’s office to inquire about the state-specific process. Governors and state education agency program administrators may contact RISE@ed.gov with any questions and to indicate a state’s plans to participate for the coming cycle."
19-Apr-24,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-releases-final-title-ix-regulations-providing-vital-protections-against-sex-discrimination,"U.S. Department of Education Releases Final Title IX Regulations, Providing Vital Protections Against Sex Discrimination","Department Advances Educational Equity and Opportunity For more than 50 years, Title IX has paved the way for tremendous strides in access to education for millions of students across the country. Every student deserves educational opportunity free from discrimination. That is why today the U.S. Department of Education (Department) released its Final Rule under Title IX, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs or activities receiving federal financial assistance. The final regulations promote educational equity and opportunity for students across the country as well as accountability and fairness, while empowering and supporting students and families. “For more than 50 years, Title IX has promised an equal opportunity to learn and thrive in our nation's schools free from sex discrimination,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “These final regulations build on the legacy of Title IX by clarifying that all our nation’s students can access schools that are safe, welcoming, and respect their rights.” The final regulations advance Title IX's promise of ensuring that no person experiences sex discrimination, including sex-based harassment or sexual violence, in federally funded education. The final regulations restore and strengthen vital protections for students, and provide schools with information to meet their Title IX obligations while offering appropriate discretion and flexibility to account for variations in school size, student populations, and administrative structures. The final regulations also require schools to take prompt and effective action when notified of conduct that reasonably may constitute sex discrimination in their education programs or activities. The final regulations also reaffirm the Department's core commitment to fundamental fairness for all parties, the rights of parents and guardians to support their minor children, and respect for complainants' autonomy. The final regulations: Protect against all sex-based harassment and discrimination. The final rule protects all students and employees from all sex discrimination prohibited under Title IX, including by restoring and strengthening full protection from sexual violence and other sex-based harassment. The rule clarifies the steps a school must take to protect students, employees, and applicants from discrimination based on pregnancy or related conditions. And the rule protects against discrimination based on sex stereotypes, sexual orientation, gender identity, and sex characteristics. Promote accountability and fairness. The final rule promotes accountability by requiring schools to take prompt and effective action to end any sex discrimination in their education programs or activities, prevent its recurrence, and remedy its effects. The final rule requires schools to respond promptly to all complaints of sex discrimination with a fair, transparent, and reliable process that includes trained, unbiased decisionmakers to evaluate all relevant and not otherwise impermissible evidence. Empower and support students and families. The final rule protects against retaliation for students, employees, and others who exercise their Title IX rights. The rule requires schools to communicate their nondiscrimination policies and procedures to all students, employees, and other participants in their education programs so that students and families understand their rights. The rule supports the right of parents and guardians to act on behalf of their elementary school and secondary school children. And the rule protects student privacy by prohibiting schools from making disclosures of personally identifiable information with limited exceptions. “These final regulations clarify Title IX’s requirement that schools promptly and effectively address all forms of sex discrimination,” said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon. “We look forward to working with schools, students, and families to prevent and eliminate sex discrimination.” The Department’s rulemaking process is still ongoing for a Title IX regulation related to athletics. The Department proposed amendments to its athletics regulations in April 2023, and received over 150,000 public comments, which by law must be carefully considered. The unofficial version of the final regulations is available here . In addition, the Department has released a fact sheet , a summary of the major provisions of the final regulations, and a resource for drafting Title IX nondiscrimination policies, notices of nondiscrimination, and grievance procedures. The final regulations are effective on Aug 1, 2024, and apply to complaints of sex discrimination regarding alleged conduct that occurs on or after that date. The Department is committed to supporting schools in implementing the final regulations and will provide technical assistance and additional resources to schools to support implementation and compliance."
16-Apr-24,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-opens-new-path-incarcerated-borrowers-exit-default,Biden-Harris Administration Opens New Path for Incarcerated Borrowers to Exit Default,"The U.S. Department of Education (Department) today announced a new path for borrowers who are incarcerated to exit default through consolidation, providing them access to improve their credit and better repayment options than ever before. Borrowers who had student loans before becoming incarcerated can now consolidate their loans to get out of default, providing them with certain types of loans—including Perkins Loans and commercially held Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFEL) loans—to gain access to income-driven repayment (IDR) plans like the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) Plan. Borrowers who are incarcerated can still sign up for Fresh Start until Sept. 30, 2024, as an additional option to exit default. Previously, this population of borrowers would have to rehabilitate their loans to get out of default rather than having the option to consolidate. The Department has already taken several actions to support students and borrowers who are incarcerated, helping them forge new beginnings. This includes implementing new Prison Education Program (PEP) regulations in July 2023. While Second Chance Pell allowed more than 40,000 students to receive Pell grants, this mass expansion of federal financial aid will allow a far greater number of students to access federal Pell grants. PEPs allow students to continue their education and receive access to Pell grants and federal student loans while incarcerated, building off the Second Chance Pell Experimental Sites Initiative started during the Obama-Biden Administration. Through expanded access to Pell grants through PEPs, the Department has the potential to reach more than 760,000 incarcerated individuals. The Department anticipates approving at least 50 PEPs by 2025.Through partnerships with the U.S. Department of Justice’s Bureau of Justice Assistance and the Federal Bureau of Prisons, as well as the Vera Institute of Justice, 47 states, the Bureau of Prisons, and Puerto Rico are prepared to accept applications for PEPs. As part of today’s announcement, and in celebration of Second Chance Month , U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona visited a Second Chance Pell program at Cheshire Correctional Institution in Cheshire, Connecticut to highlight the Department’s efforts to provide access to educational programs for people who are incarcerated and enabling a jump start. “Every person deserves the opportunity to become the best version of themselves, but too many individuals who are incarcerated never get that opportunity,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “By increasing access to repayment options for student loan borrowers who are incarcerated, the Department of Education is taking one important step to help them to reclaim their lives and rewrite their own narratives.” Borrowers who had student loans before becoming incarcerated can consolidate their loans by contacting their student loan servicer, as long as they are not students (such as enrolled in a PEP or SCP program) when they consolidate. The Department encourages borrowers with loans in default to consider signing up for Fresh Start , the Department’s temporary program that helps borrowers get out of default and automatically receive the benefits of returning to a current repayment status. The deadline to enroll in Fresh Start is Sept. 30, 2024. Borrowers who remain in default may be unable to receive certain relief measures and may be subject to financial consequences , which can be severe and long lasting. Prior to today’s announcement, borrowers who are incarcerated with loans other than Direct Loans had limited options to get out of default. Now, these borrowers will have an easier path to get out of default—stopping harmful credit reporting and improving future financial prospects—and return to repayment status during their incarceration. The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to empowering individuals who are incarcerated to have a second chance and making federal student loans more affordable for everyone. Borrowers can learn more about loan consolidation on StudentAid.gov . Borrowers can learn more about Fresh Start at StudentAid.gov/freshstart and about the SAVE Plan at StudentAid.gov/SAVE ."
16-Apr-24,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-releases-first-set-draft-rules-provide-debt-relief-millions-borrowers,Biden-Harris Administration Releases First Set of Draft Rules to Provide Debt Relief to Millions of Borrowers,"The Biden-Harris Administration today released its first set of draft rules that propose to provide student debt relief for tens of millions of borrowers across the country. These plans were announced last week by President Biden in Madison, Wisconsin. If implemented as proposed, these plans, and others announced by the President, would bring the total number of borrowers getting relief under the Biden-Harris Administration to more than 30 million. To date, the Biden-Harris Administration has taken historic action to approve debt cancellation for nearly 4.3 million borrowers, totaling $153 billion in debt forgiveness through various actions. “Today's announcement shows that the Biden-Harris Administration is continuing to fulfill our promises to fix a broken higher education system,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""Student loan forgiveness isn't only about relief for today's borrowers. It's about social mobility, economic prosperity, and creating America that lives up to its highest ideals."" The rules will be formally published in the Federal Register on Wednesday, April 17 for a 30-day comment period. The U.S. Department of Education (Department) will carefully consider comments received and aims to finalize these rules in time to start delivering relief this fall, including for borrowers who have been subject to runaway interest. The Department will publish a second draft rule focused on providing relief for borrowers experiencing hardship in the coming months. The draft includes nine rules that permit separate and distinct types of waivers using the Secretary of Education’s longstanding authority under the Higher Education Act. Eight of these are applicable to loans held by the Department, while a ninth addresses commercially held loans in the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program. These rules are: Cancelling runaway interest More than 25 million borrowers owe more than they originally borrowed, including many who have made years of payments, due to the interest that accrues on Federal student loans. The Department proposes two rules to address this issue through automatic relief. One would permit automatic relief of up to $20,000 of the amount by which a borrower’s loans currently exceed what they owed upon starting repayment. This relief could be provided automatically to all types of student loans held by the Department, including parent loans, consolidation loans, and loans in default. A second, separate rule would permit the Secretary to forgive the full amount by which a borrower saw their balance grow after entering repayment if the borrower is enrolled in any Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) plan and has annual income equal to or below $120,000 if they are single or $240,000 if they are a married couple that files taxes jointly. No application will be needed for borrowers to receive this relief if these plans are implemented as proposed. The Department estimates over 75% of borrowers benefitting from uncapped interest relief are Pell Grant recipients, and over two-thirds of borrowers benefiting from the automatic $20,000 in interest relief are Pell recipients. Combined, these rules could eliminate all balance growth since entering repayment for 23 million borrowers. Eliminating student debt for borrowers who entered repayment at least 20 years ago This rule would help an estimated 2.6 million borrowers who still have outstanding debt on old loans that entered repayment at least two decades ago. The proposal would permit student debt forgiveness for borrowers with only undergraduate debt if they first entered repayment at least 20 years ago (on or before July 1, 2005), and borrowers with any graduate school debt would qualify if they first entered repayment 25 or more years ago (on or before July 1, 2000). As proposed, this relief would be provided automatically to any type of loan held by the Department, including parent loans and consolidation loans. The Department proposes this rule to provide one-time relief but seeks comment on how to consider ways to assist borrowers who are close to, but not quite at, the timeline for proposed relief while still encouraging them to make payments. The Department proposes a separate rule to authorize relief to any borrower with a commercial loan in the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program that first entered repayment on or before July 1, 2000. Authorizing the automatic discharge of debt for borrowers who are otherwise eligible for loan forgiveness under SAVE, closed school discharge, PSLF, or other forgiveness programs, but not enrolled The draft includes two separate rules that could assist borrowers who are otherwise eligible for relief under existing forgiveness opportunities but have not successfully applied due to paperwork requirements, bad advice, or other obstacles. One section would authorize relief to borrowers identified by the Secretary who are otherwise eligible for relief under payment plans, including Saving on A Valuable Education (SAVE) and other IDR plans but have not successfully applied. The Department estimates this provision could help 1.7 million borrowers eligible for relief under the SAVE Plan provision that provides relief sooner than the typical 20 or 25-year timeline for borrowers with smaller original loan balances. A second section proposes to authorize relief for borrowers eligible for forgiveness opportunities like closed school discharges but have not successfully applied. The Department’s initial estimate is that this could help around 250,000 borrowers based on closed school discharges. Automatic relief under these two rules would only be permitted for loans that are eligible for the relevant type of forgiveness, as some programs are not available for parent borrowers or non-Direct Loans. These proposed rules could provide this relief on an ongoing basis. The Department separately proposes to authorize relief to commercial FFEL borrowers who are identified as eligible for closed school discharges but have not successfully applied. Helping borrowers who enrolled in low-financial-value programs or institutions Three additional rules would authorize ongoing relief for borrowers who took out debt to attend programs or institutions that failed to provide sufficient financial value. One provision could assist borrowers whose debt came from institutions or programs that lost access to Federal aid following a Secretarial action. This includes institutions or programs that lost access due to high student loan default rates, producing graduates whose debt represents too large a share of their income, graduates whose earnings are no better than those of a high school graduate, or were subject to a final agency action to terminate aid for failing to provide sufficient financial value. A second provision would authorize relief for borrowers whose schools or programs faced similar situations but closed before the action was finalized. A final provision could help borrowers whose programs closed and the Department determines their graduates had high levels of debt relative to earnings or insufficient earnings compared to a high school graduate. The Department also proposes separate provisions to assist commercial FFEL borrowers who took out loans during the period associated with high default rates that resulted in their institution losing access to federal aid. A forthcoming rule to assist borrowers experiencing hardship paying back their loans The Department also remains hard at work on a separate proposal that would help many other borrowers experiencing hardship related to student loans that creates a barrier to them fully repaying their loans or the cost of collection is not justified. That rule will be released for comment in the coming months. It will include proposals to authorize the automatic forgiveness of loans for borrowers at a high risk of future default as well as those who show hardship due to other indicators, such as high medical and caregiving expenses. The regulatory text in this proposed rule will mirror the proposals that achieved consensus among negotiators in February. “These distinct forms of debt relief are designed for borrowers struggling with their loans – and that’s a lot of people,” said Under Secretary of Education James Kvaal. “There are 25 million borrowers whose interest is growing faster than they can pay it down. That fact alone shows how badly President Biden’s student loan relief is needed.” An unparalleled track record of borrower assistance The Biden-Harris Administration has taken historic steps to reduce the burden of student debt and ensure that student loans are not a barrier to opportunity for students and families. The Administration secured the largest increase to Pell Grants in a decade and finalized new rules to protect borrowers from career programs that leave graduates with unaffordable debts or insufficient earnings. The Administration has also approved $153 billion for nearly 4.3 million borrowers, including: $49.2 billion for more than 996,000 borrowers through improvements to IDR that addressed longstanding administrative failure and the misuse of forbearance by loan servicers. $62.8 billion in forgiveness for almost 876,000 borrowers through fixes to PSLF. $4.8 billion for almost 360,000 borrowers on the SAVE plan. These are borrowers who originally took out smaller loans for their postsecondary studies. $22.5 billion for more than 1.3 million borrowers who were cheated by their schools, saw their institutions precipitously close, or are covered by related court settlements. $14.1 billion for more 548,000 borrowers with a total and permanent disability."
11-Apr-24,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-announces-additional-74-billion-approved-student-debt-relief-277000-borrowers,"Biden-Harris Administration Announces Additional $7.4 Billion in Approved Student Debt Relief for 277,000 Borrowers","The Biden-Harris Administration announced today the approval of $7.4 billion in additional student loan debt relief for 277,000 borrowers. These discharges are for borrowers who signed up for President Biden’s Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) Plan and are eligible for its shortened time-to-forgiveness benefit and as a result of fixes made by the Administration to income-driven repayment (IDR) forgiveness. This action comes as nearly 8 million borrowers have been helped by the SAVE plan. That includes 4.5 million with a $0 monthly payment. Today’s announcement brings the total loan forgiveness approved by the Biden-Harris Administration to $153 billion for nearly 4.3 million Americans. Thanks to this Administration’s efforts one out of every 10 Federal student loan borrowers has now been approved for some debt relief. This action builds on President Biden and his Administration’s efforts to provide debt relief to as many borrowers as possible as quickly as possible. “Today’s announcement shows—once again—that the Biden-Harris Administration is not letting up its efforts to give hardworking Americans some breathing room,” U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona said. “As long as there are people with overwhelming student loan debt competing with basic needs such as food and healthcare, we will remain relentless in our pursuit to bring relief to millions across the country.” The debt relief announced today is broken down into the following categories: $3.6 billion for nearly 206,800 borrowers through SAVE. This relief will go to borrowers who are enrolled in the SAVE Plan who had smaller loans for their postsecondary studies. Borrowers can receive relief after at least 10 years of payments if they originally borrowed $12,000 or less for college. Each additional $1,000 in borrowing adds 12 more months until forgiveness. All borrowers on SAVE receive forgiveness after 20 or 25 years, depending on whether they have loans for graduate school. The benefit is based upon the original principal balance of all Federal loans borrowed to attend school, not what a borrower currently owes or the amount of an individual loan. Today’s announcement brings total relief approved underwi SAVE to $4.8 billion for almost 360,000 borrowers. $3.5 billion for 65,800 borrowers through administrative adjustments to IDR payment counts that have brought borrowers closer to forgiveness and address longstanding concerns with the misuse of forbearance by loan servicers. Including today’s announcement, the Biden-Harris Administration has now approved $49.2 billion in IDR relief for more than 996,000 borrowers. $300 million for 4,600 borrowers through fixes to Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF). This update comes shortly after the Department announced new PSLF discharges a few weeks ago. The Administration has now approved $62.8 billion in forgiveness for almost 876,000 borrowers through PSLF. “Today we are helping 277,000 borrowers who have been making payments on their student loans for at least a decade,” said U.S. Under Secretary of Education James Kvaal. “They have paid what they can afford, and they have earned loan forgiveness for the balance of their loan.” As discussed in a recent report by the Council of Economic Advisors, the relief provided by these discharges and other actions taken by the Administration could boost short-term consumption and have positive effects on borrower mental health, financial security, and outcomes such as homeownership and entrepreneurship. Borrowers will begin receiving emails today informing them of their approvals. Their relief will be processed in the weeks following. New Plans to Deliver Debt Relief to Tens of Millions of Americans Earlier this week, the Biden-Harris Administration released initial details of a new set of plans that would provide student debt relief for tens of millions of borrowers across the country. The plans would bring the total number of borrowers eligible for student debt relief to over 30 million, including the 4 million borrowers who have already been approved for debt cancellation by the Biden-Harris Administration over the past three years. The plans announced by President Biden are the next step in a regulatory process that began last summer to provide debt relief to as many borrowers as possible as quickly as possible under the Higher Education Act. The proposals would permit the following types of waivers: Waiving accrued and capitalized interest for millions of borrowers; Automatically discharging debt for borrowers otherwise eligible for loan forgiveness under SAVE, closed school discharge, or other forgiveness programs, but not enrolled; Eliminating student debt for borrowers who entered repayment 20 or more years ago; Helping borrowers who enrolled in low-financial-value programs or institutions; and Assisting borrowers who experience hardship in paying back their loans. An Unparalleled Track Record of Borrower Assistance The Biden-Harris Administration has taken historic steps to reduce the burden of student debt and ensure that student loans are not a barrier to opportunity for students and families. The Administration secured the largest increase to the maximum Pell Grant in a decade and finalized new rules to protect borrowers from career programs that leave graduates with unaffordable debts or insufficient earnings. Beyond the relief under IDR, SAVE, and PSLF, the Biden-Harris Administration has also approved: $22.5 billion for more than 1.3 million borrowers who were cheated by their schools, saw their institutions precipitously close, or are covered by related court settlements. $14.1 billion for more 548,000 borrowers with a total and permanent disability.

11-Apr-24,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-educations-office-civil-rights-announces-resolution-pregnancy-discrimination-investigation-hinds-community-college,U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights Announces Resolution of Pregnancy Discrimination Investigation of Hinds Community College,"The U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) today announced that the Hinds Community College in Mississippi entered into a resolution agreement to address a student’s pregnancy discrimination complaint. OCR determined that the college violated Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 after investigating allegations that Hinds Community College failed to provide a pregnant student with necessary academic adjustments or necessary services during and after her pregnancy. OCR also determined that the college violated Title IX in its response to the student’s complaints of pregnancy discrimination and harassment. Additionally, OCR identified a compliance concern related to Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504) that the college did not consider whether the student’s pregnancy complications constituted a temporary disability. The student informed college staff of her pregnancy at the beginning of what should have been her final semester at the college. Throughout the semester, she repeatedly asked for academic adjustments that would allow her to occasionally leave instruction a few minutes early for pregnancy-related medical appointments, remotely attend a lecture while hospitalized for pregnancy-related conditions, and take breaks to express milk after delivering her child. The college had no process in place to respond to the student’s requests, nor did the college recognize pregnancy and related conditions as Title IX matters. The student developed complications resulting in the premature birth of her baby. Rather than providing academic adjustments as required under Title IX, or considering whether the student’s pregnancy had caused a temporary disability and working with the student to provide necessary academic adjustments under Section 504, college staff members encouraged the student to withdraw from the semester and consider finishing the program later. As a result of the college’s failures, the student was relegated, at times, to pumping in a restroom. Following the semester, the student filed a Title IX complaint based on the lack of adjustments as well as alleged harassment and discrimination by college staff. OCR found that the college failed to respond to the student’s complaint consistent with Title IX at every turn. Upon the student’s report of harassment and discrimination, the college failed to provide information to the student about how to file a formal complaint and regarding supportive measures. The college also failed to fulfill its Title IX obligations during its investigation of the student’s complaint. The college failed to provide the student with an opportunity to inspect and review evidence and appeal rights. OCR also identified a concern about the sufficiency of the college’s Title IX investigation because it did not interview key witnesses. The college agreed to take specific actions to resolve this investigation and signed an agreement memorializing that commitment. “We look forward to working with Hinds Community College – the largest community college in Mississippi – to ensure that it provides pregnant students’ equal access to the programs and educational opportunities the college offers,” said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon. The college’s commitments in the voluntary resolution agreement include: Revising its nondiscrimination notice, Title IX policies and grievance procedures to comply with Title IX; Publishing information on its website for pregnant students about their Title IX rights and how to seek academic adjustments, special services, or excused absences; Training its Title IX coordinator and other school employees involved in addressing Title IX requests from pregnant students regarding Title IX’s and Section 504’s protections for pregnant students and the academic adjustments and special services available to pregnant students; Tracking and documenting requests by pregnant students to ensure pregnancy-related adjustments are being provided; and Taking other measures to directly remedy the discrimination against the student.

11-Apr-24,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-office-civil-rights-resolves-restraint-and-seclusion-compliance-review-denton-independent-school-district-texas,U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights Resolves Restraint and Seclusion Compliance Review of Denton Independent School District in Texas,"Today, the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) announced that the Denton Independent School District in Texas has entered into a resolution agreement to ensure that its restraint policies and practices do not deny students with disabilities a free appropriate public education (FAPE). OCR’s review identified a number of concerns with the district’s compliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504) and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (Title II) and their implementing regulations with respect to district restraint practices. In particular, OCR’s review revealed that students ultimately identified as students with disabilities were restrained multiple times before the district initiated an evaluation to determine whether the students may need special education or related aids and services. For example, the district restrained one student 18 times before conducting an evaluation that resulted in the district classifying the student as a student with a disability for whom appropriate supports could obviate a need for restraint. OCR also identified concerns with the frequency and duration of student restraints. For example, the district restrained at least 12 students 10 or more times per student and the district restrained one student 43 times; in another example the district restrained a student on two separate occasions for more than an hour each time. District documentation often did not indicate that the district considered the impact of the restraints on the student’s receipt of FAPE from the district. OCR’s review also revealed that the district permitted School Resource Officers (SROs) to restrain students with disabilities without having been properly trained on student restraint in educational settings or on the district’s obligations regarding the provision of FAPE to students with disabilities and OCR also found that district staff lacked a consistent understanding of when it would be appropriate for an SRO to assist with student restraints. This inconsistency is reflected, for example, by SROs’ frequent involvement in restraints even in the absence of probable cause to believe a crime was being committed, contrary to the district’s stated position that SROs should only be involved in criminal matters. OCR’s review revealed that the district’s documentation of restraint incidents contained significant gaps, hindering the district’s capacity to evaluate its satisfaction of its Section 504 and Title II obligations to its students. Many restraint forms provided by the district lacked clear identification of the staff members involved, start and end times of restraints, or the underlying behavior necessitating the restraint, which could hinder the district’s ability to consider this information in re-evaluating the students’ individual educational and behavioral needs. And district staff reported inconsistent understanding regarding whether and/or when a restraint by an SRO should be documented, raising concern about whether district records accurately reflect these restraints and allow for district evaluation of them. Finally, OCR’s review revealed a concern that the district does not provide clear notice to parents/guardians of the individual(s) designated by the district to coordinate its efforts to comply with Section 504 and Title II, thereby hindering parents’ and guardians’ ability to request re-evaluations as necessary to ensure their children receive a FAPE. The district did not report, and OCR’s investigation did not identify, any incidents of student seclusion. The resolution agreement commits the district to taking the following actions: Convening Section 504 and/or Admission Review and Dismissal (ARD) committees to re-evaluate the needs of students identified during the review who may have been denied a FAPE as a result of the district’s use of restraint and timely providing any compensatory services identified as necessary for identified students. Reviewing and revising as necessary the district’s policies and procedures governing restraint, including the involvement of SROs in restraint incidents. Developing a process for the creation, maintenance, and review of records documenting each incident of student restraint. Developing a process to ensure accurate reporting of all restraint incidents to the Department’s Civil Rights Data Collection. Reviewing each incident of restraint in which an SRO was involved between 2022-23 and 2023-24 school years to assess the impact on individual students restrained and to inform the district’s policies and practices regarding SRO involvement in restraint incidents. Reviewing the district’s policies regarding the involvement of SROs in restraint incidents, including revising Memoranda of Understanding and district policy as necessary to ensure all policies and agreements include clearly defined roles and areas of responsibility for SROs, including when staff may involve SROs in restraints and how such incidents should be documented. Establishing an annual review process for SRO involvement in student restraints. Establishing a monitoring program to monitor the use of restraint in students in all district schools to safeguard student rights under Section 504 and Title II. Ensuring that all staff who may be involved in student restraints receive training regarding the use of restraint on students, including the district’s policies and procedures relating to the recording of all incidents of restraint. Ensuring that all staff receive training regarding the District’s obligation to provide a FAPE to students with disabilities pursuant to Section 504 and Title II. Offering training to all SROs contracted by the District to serve on District campuses regarding the District’s policies and procedures regarding restraint, including recordkeeping procedures, as well as the District’s nondiscrimination obligations pursuant to Section 504 and Title II. “Through this agreement, Denton Independent School District has committed to important steps to ensure students with disabilities will not be denied their federal civil right to a free and appropriate public education because of the district’s use of restraint,” said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon. “The district’s commitments to ensure that school resource officers contracted by the district are aware of their obligations to students with disabilities, improve recordkeeping to evaluate district fulfillment of student rights as well as staff training to protect these rights, and to make whole students who have been harmed by past restraint practices reflect appropriate leadership to address this crucial, and sometimes life-or-death, issue.” The letter to Denton Independent School District and the resolution agreement are available on the OCR website ."
8-Apr-24,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-announces-new-plans-deliver-debt-relief-tens-millions-americans,Biden-Harris Administration Announces New Plans to Deliver Debt Relief to Tens of Millions of Americans,"Department of Education releases new state-by-state numbers showing the effect of four major discharge program proposals for the 4 million borrowers who have already been approved for relief The Biden-Harris Administration today released initial details of a new set of plans that would provide student debt relief for tens of millions of borrowers across the country. The plans would bring the total number of borrowers eligible for student debt relief to over 30 million, including the 4 million borrowers who have already been approved for debt cancellation by the Biden-Harris Administration over the past three years. The public will have an opportunity to comment on these plans in the coming weeks. The U.S. Department of Education (Department) is also releasing combined state-by-state totals for approved discharge across four existing major student loan forgiveness programs: Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF), Income-Drive Repayment (IDR), Saving On A Valuable Education (SAVE), and Total and Permanent Disability (TPD). “These state-by-state numbers show the Biden-Harris Administration’s historic student loan efforts are already improving lives in every part of the country,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “Thanks to our unapologetic commitment to provide relief to as many borrowers as possible as quickly as possible, our regulatory efforts would help tens of millions more borrowers find financial breathing room—and help fix our country’s broken higher education system.” The plans announced by President Biden are the next step in a regulatory process that began last summer to provide debt relief to as many borrowers as possible as quickly as possible under the Higher Education Act. The proposals would permit the following types of waivers: Waiving accrued and capitalized interest for millions of borrowers More than 25 million borrowers owe more than they originally borrowed, including many who have made years of payments, due to the interest that accrues on Federal student loans. President Biden will announce plans to cancel up to $20,000 of the amount a borrower’s balance has grown due to unpaid interest on their loans after entering repayment, regardless of their income. Low and middle-income borrowers enrolled in the SAVE Plan or any other income-driven repayment (IDR) plan would be eligible for waiver of the entire amount their balance has grown since entering repayment. This group of borrowers includes single borrowers who earn $120,000 or less and married borrowers who file joint tax returns who earn $240,000 or less. No application will be needed for borrowers to receive this relief if the plan is finalized as proposed. We estimate that of the 25 million borrowers potentially helped by such a waiver, 23 million would see the entirety of their balance growth eliminated. Automatically discharging debt for borrowers otherwise eligible for loan forgiveness under SAVE, closed school discharge, or other forgiveness programs, but not enrolled Too many borrowers eligible for relief—including immediate cancellation—have historically not been able to overcome paperwork requirements, bad advice, or other obstacles. While the Department has worked to make it easier to apply for relief, the proposed plans would automatically cancel debt for borrowers otherwise eligible for relief through the SAVE plan, closed school loan discharges, PSLF, or other forgiveness opportunities but who have not successfully applied for that assistance. For instance, borrowers who are eligible for the shortened period until forgiveness under SAVE could receive help automatically. This applies to borrowers who originally took out $12,000 or less in loans and have been in repayment for 10 years that would be eligible to get their remaining debt waived. For every additional $1,000 in loans they took out (up to $21,000 total for undergraduate loans and $26,000 total for graduate loans), a borrower would be eligible for relief after an additional year of repayment. For example, if a borrower took out $13,000 in loans, they would be eligible for debt cancelation after 11 years in repayment. Eliminating student debt for borrowers in repayment for 20 years or more More than 2 million borrowers have been repaying had their student loans for two decades or longer and still carry debt from these old loans. The Administration’s new proposals would waive student debt for borrowers with only undergraduate debt would qualify for forgiveness if they first entered repayment at least 20 years ago (on or before July 1, 2005), and borrowers with any graduate school debt would qualify if they first entered repayment 25 or more years ago (on or before July 1, 2000). Both Direct Loans and Direct Consolidation Loans that repay only undergraduate study or graduate study for 20 or 25 years respectively are eligible for relief in this proposal. Borrowers would not need to be on an income-driven repayment plan to qualify. Helping borrowers who enrolled in low-financial-value programs or institutions The Administration has worked aggressively to hold colleges accountable when they leave students with mountains of debt and without good job prospects. The Administration is proposing to waive loans from borrowers who took on debt to enroll in institutions or programs that lost their eligibility to participate in the Federal student aid program or were denied recertification because they cheated or took advantage of students. Further, borrowers who attended institutions or programs that closed and failed to provide sufficient value—for example those that leave graduates with unaffordable loan payments or earnings no better than what someone with a high school diploma earns—would be eligible for relief under this proposal. Assisting borrowers who experience hardship in paying back their loans While these proposed plans and executive actions to date would help tens of millions of borrowers, there are many other borrowers whose student loans continue to be a barrier for them participating in the economy, accessing economic mobility, or pursuing their dreams. The Administration will also pursue a specific action that is dedicated to canceling student debt for borrowers experiencing hardship in their daily lives that prevent them from fully paying back their loans now or in the future. This could include delivering automatic forgiveness to borrowers predicted to be likely to default on their loans, or through an individualized applications where borrowers could detail their financial hardship that is preventing them from being able to fully pay back their loan, such as a child care or medical expense. ""These historic steps reflect President Biden’s determination that we cannot allow student debt to leave students worse off than before they went to college,” said U.S. Under Secretary of Education James Kvaal. “The President directed us to complete these programs as quickly as possible, and we are going to do just that.” New State-by-State Data on Forgiveness Efforts The Department’s new set of State-by-State numbers shows the statewide impact of 85 percent of the $146 billion in approved relief for 4 million borrowers under this Administration. Today’s numbers highlight the State-level effect of four major programs reformed and improved by the Biden-Harris Administration: Income-Driven Repayment Forgiveness: Nearly $46 billion in relief to more than 930,000 borrowers. Prior to the Biden-Harris Administration, only 50 borrowers had received forgiveness through these programs. The Administration addressed longstanding challenges with inaccurately tracking progress toward forgiveness and misuse of forbearances to ensure borrowers got the credit they deserve. Public Service Loan Forgiveness: $62.5 billion for nearly 872,000 borrowers. The Biden-Harris Administration restored the broken promise of PSLF. Just 7,000 borrowers had been approved for forgiveness prior to President Biden taking office. SAVE Early Forgiveness: $1.2 billion in loans for nearly 153,000 borrowers who are eligible for the shortened time to forgiveness benefit under President Biden’s SAVE Plan. Total and Permanent Disability Discharge: $14.1 billion for 548,300 borrowers. In August 2021 the Biden-Harris Administration issued a final rule automatically discharging the loans of borrowers identified as eligible for a total and permanent disability discharge based upon a data match with the Social Security Administration. The Administration also rewrote rules to simplify the process of becoming eligible for a disability discharge that went into effect on July 1 of last year. An unparalleled track record of borrower assistance The Biden-Harris Administration has taken historic steps to reduce the burden of student debt and ensure that student loans are not a barrier to opportunity for students and families. The Administration secured the largest increase to Pell Grants in a decade and finalized new rules to protect borrowers from career programs that leave graduates with unaffordable debts or insufficient earnings. Beyond the state-by-state relief, the Administration has also approved $22.5 billion for more than 1.3 million borrowers who were cheated by their schools, saw their institutions precipitously close, or are covered by related court settlements.

Today, ED joined the Biden-Harris Administration’s Good Jobs Initiative, a call to action across the federal government to help shore up access to and retention of good jobs as the foundation of a thriving economy that lifts all people in our nation. As part of this initiative, ED is issuing a set of Good Jobs Principles for Education describing high-quality working conditions that comprise a good job and will help attract and retain a high-quality education workforce in all roles and at all levels, from early childhood through higher education. Additionally, since President Biden took office, the number of states with teacher registered apprenticeship programs has grown from zero to 34 states and Puerto Rico. Building on this progress, today ED and DOL are announcing availability of new funding and resources to support the expansion of high-quality and affordable pathways into careers in education, addressing a key factor driving educator shortages. These announcements will be made as part of a joint trip between U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona and Acting U.S. Secretary of Labor Julie Su in Reno and Las Vegas, Nevada this week. “Recruiting and retaining high-quality educators and education staff to provide and support core instruction from pre-K through college is central to student success—and to creating strong pathways to good, family-sustaining jobs,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “The new funding the Department is releasing, alongside the Education Good Jobs Principles published today, recognize that when workers have access to competitive wages, benefits, working conditions, and growth opportunities, their voices are respected, their communities thrive, and they can develop the next generation of skilled workers, leaders, and citizens.” “We depend on educators to open doors for their students. It is equally important that we ensure our nation’s educators enjoy the benefits and security of having a good job,” said Acting Secretary of Labor Julie Su. “Through these Principles and in partnership with the Department of Education, we seek to open doors for a new generation of educators, including expanding access to Registered Apprenticeships and readiness programs, especially for workers in historically underserved communities. While careers in education are often referred to as a calling, we must ensure that those educating our young people are in good, family-sustaining jobs by building clear pathways to higher wages, increased benefits, and better working conditions.”; Today’s announcements include: Good Jobs Principles A strong educator workforce is vital to preparing students for college and career pathways and workplaces offering good jobs. The Biden-Harris Administration’s Good Jobs Initiative, led by DOL, promotes economic mobility by helping embed good jobs across our communities. The north star for this effort is the Good Jobs Principles , a shared federal vision of job quality—published by DOL and the U.S. Department of Commerce in 2022—that has impacted nearly $240 billion in federal investments through Investing in America (IIA) awards toward infrastructure and technology. These Principles describe how workers can be provided with stable, quality jobs that provide equitable treatment to all applicants and employees. Building on this work, ED is publishing the Good Jobs Principles for Education, developed in coordination with DOL, to align educators’ working conditions with a federal framework that can help guide how jobs in the education field are treated nationwide. Good Jobs Principles have helped shape high labor standards in other areas of Administration policy, including through requiring, prioritizing, or encouraging high labor standards in grant-making, procurement and other investments. The Good Jobs Principles for Education encourage all education institutions, systems, and organizations to provide quality jobs that provide a competitive wage, family-sustaining benefits, job security, safe working conditions, and access to career advancement opportunities as the foundation for good quality jobs. ED will seek out best practices from labor management collaboration to innovative collective bargaining agreements to uplift models in education for workforce resiliency. ED will promote the Principles and encourage their adoption across educational settings and, where possible, in Department practice. ED is the seventh agency to announce its partnership with the Good Jobs Initiative, joining the U.S. Departments of Interior, Commerce, Transportation, and Energy, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency and the General Services Administration. While in Reno, Secretary Cardona and Acting Secretary Su will speak to educators at Washoe County School District where, as a result of the most recent contract negotiated by the Washoe County School Board with the district’s unions, and additional matching funds provided by the state, teachers will get a 20 percent pay raise over two years, and education support professionals will receive a 20 percent pay raise as well. Retention bonuses will be given to special education teachers and in-demand job categories like bus drivers, custodians, and food service workers for an additional year. High-Quality and Affordable Pathways into Education ED and DOL are additionally taking actions today to further expand access to high-quality and affordable pathways into education professions, including residency, grow your own, and Registered Apprenticeship programs. Too many young people, paraprofessionals, and potential career changers dream of becoming a teacher but cannot afford to pursue high-quality pathways into the profession due to financial barriers. Yet teachers who go through comprehensive, evidence-based pathways are two to three times more likely to remain in the profession compared to their peers who go through low-quality pathways. Investments to help grow high-quality and evidence-based pathways, and provide future teachers with robust clinical experience and financial support, can help to make sure they enter the classroom better prepared to teach on day one.; While is Las Vegas, Nevada, Secretary Cardona and Acting Secretary Su will visit Laura Dearing Elementary School to highlight paraprofessionals apprentices working towards their teaching certification as part of the University of Las Vegas Paraprofessional Pathways Project, in partnership with Clark County School District.; The Departments’ funding opportunities include : Nearly $50 million from ED to expand high-quality and affordable educator preparation programs. This funding includes: $25 million in the Teacher Quality Partnership Grant program , which invests in high-quality, evidence-based educator programs, including teacher residency programs that include a year of on-the-job learning in the classroom. The competition includes priorities for applications that are designed to increase educator diversity and support evidence-based grow-your-own programs, including high school dual enrollment, and Registered Apprenticeship Programs for teachers that are fully aligned with high-quality design principles. $15 million for the Augustus F. Hawkins Centers of Excellence program to support high-quality teacher preparation programs and address teacher shortages through investments in Educator Preparation Programs at Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribally Controlled Colleges and Universities, and Minority Serving Institutions, including Hispanic Serving Institutions, with a State-accredited teacher preparation program. Programs supported by Hawkins include evidence-based, comprehensive pre-service clinical experiences and increase the diversity of the teacher workforce and teacher pipeline programs. $8 million in the National Professional Development program which supports pre-service training programs for teachers, paraprofessionals, administrators, and aspiring educators, including high school students (for example, through dual enrollment and early college programs), who want to become fully certified as bilingual or multilingual educators. Nearly $200 million from DOL to support Registered Apprenticeship, which include K-12 teachers as a priority occupation. This funding includes: 100 million for a second round of State Apprenticeship Expansion Formula Grants to support the Administration’s goals to modernize and strengthen the National Apprenticeship System, while also providing opportunities for those States that have the capacity and can commit to adopting and expanding new opportunities for innovation, equity, expansion, and modernization in Registered Apprenticeship.; $95 million for a second round of Apprenticeship Building America Grants to continue to expand, diversify, and strengthen the Registered Apprenticeship system through support for public and private partnerships designed to serve a range of industries and individuals and promote Registered Apprenticeship Programs as a workforce development solution that translates training into good jobs.; Additionally, ED and DOL will launch new technical assistance offerings to help support high quality Registered Apprenticeship programs for teachers, as well as other efforts to support teacher recruitment, preparation, retention, and development. This is part of the Administration’s effort to expand Registered Apprenticeship programs, including in education, launched by First Lady Dr. Jill Biden in 2022 and built upon through additional announcements in 2023. New technical assistance efforts include: The Educator Registered Apprenticeship (ERA) Intermediary for the K-12 education sector, funded by DOL, is providing supports for states, school districts, and others working to establish Registered Apprenticeship Programs (RAPs) for teachers.; States, districts, educator preparation programs, workforce boards, and labor unions/teacher associations can receive free, individualized coaching from the ERA Intermediary as they explore, develop, and implement apprenticeship programs. Many States receive support in developing statewide accelerators to help districts in a State develop RAPs in accordance with state models, guidance, or funding requirements.; State teams can apply to participate in the State Leadership Academy , a workshop series for states early in their design process or interested in designing or scaling additional apprenticeship programs. Those interested can learn more here . ED plans to support the creation of a new technical assistance center focused on the educator workforce through the FY 2024 competition for the Comprehensive Centers program. The new center will provide assistance focused on educator recruitment, preparation, retention, and development, including implementing evidence-based grow-your-own, and residency programs, and designing evidence-based teacher apprenticeship programs fully aligned to high-quality standards. Later this month, ED’s Comprehensive Center Network will also release an online learning package focused on Registered Apprenticeship Programs, featuring presentations from federal and state policy and program leaders and related resources to help design and implement high quality programs."
28-Mar-24,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-launches-government-coordinating-council-strengthen-cybersecurity-schools,U.S. Department of Education Launches Government Coordinating Council to Strengthen Cybersecurity in Schools,"The U.S. Department of Education (Department), in coordination with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), today launched the Government Coordinating Council (GCC) for the Education Facilities Subsector, a pivotal step forward in the national effort to enhance cybersecurity across K-12 educational institutions. This new council signifies an unprecedented level of collaboration between federal, state, tribal, and local governments to protect schools from cybersecurity threats. The Education Facilities Subsector is part of the Government Facilities Sector, one of 16 critical infrastructure sectors defined in Presidential Policy Directive 21. In recent years, the K-12 cybersecurity landscape has become increasingly complex, with school districts across the country experiencing ransomware attacks that shut down schools and data breaches that expose sensitive health, financial, and educational data on students, families, and staff. The formation of the GCC is a direct response to these challenges, aiming to foster a more resilient and secure K-12 digital infrastructure through structured dialogue and shared best practices. “The GCC embodies our commitment to ensuring the cybersecurity of our nation's schools,” said U.S. Deputy Secretary of Education Cindy Marten in remarks delivered to K-12 educational leaders. “This initiative represents a monumental step forward in formalizing the partnership between federal, state, and local educational leaders in protecting our K-12 critical infrastructure.” This collaborative effort builds on significant progress made by the Department in partnership with CISA, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and other federal agencies. Notably, the launch follows the “Back to School Safely” K-12 Cybersecurity Summit hosted by First Lady Jill Biden at the White House in August , underscoring the Biden-Harris Administration's whole-of-government approach to addressing cyber incident prevention, mitigation and recovery in K-12 schools. “The importance of protecting our schools, students, and educators from cyber threats cannot be overstated—I’m very proud of the work the Department of Education and CISA are doing in this critical area, working collaboratively with the K-12 community,” said CISA Director Jen Easterly. “I am especially excited that the Education Facilities Subsector Government Coordinating Council is being launched today; it will have a vital role in helping to guide efforts to ensure a safer and more resilient learning environment for our classrooms across the nation.” The GCC's inaugural meeting brought together a diverse group of educational stakeholders, including technology leaders, superintendents, school principals, as well as leaders from state agencies and educational service agencies to outline the GCC’s objectives and strategic direction. The GCC marks a significant milestone in the implementation of the National Cybersecurity Strategy, promising a safer, more secure future for students, teachers, and communities across the country. The Department of Education is committed to continuing its work with federal, state, and local partners to strengthen cybersecurity measures and ensure that our schools remain safe and supportive learning environments for all students."
21-Mar-24,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-approves-additional-58-billion-student-debt-relief-78000-public-service-workers,"Biden-Harris Administration Approves Additional $5.8 Billion in Student Debt Relief for 78,000 Public Service Workers","President Biden will email an additional 380,000 public service workers thanking them for their service and notifying them they are on track to have their debt cancelled through PSLF within two years The Biden-Harris Administration announced today the approval of $5.8 billion in additional student loan debt relief for 77,700 borrowers. These approvals are the result of fixes made by the Administration to Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF). Today’s announcement brings the total loan forgiveness approved by the Biden-Harris Administration to $143.6 billion for 3.96 million Americans. This action builds on President Biden and his Administration’s efforts to provide debt relief to as many borrowers as possible as quickly as possible. “For too long, our nation’s teachers, nurses, social workers, firefighters, and other public servants faced logistical troubles and trap doors when they tried to access the debt relief they were entitled to under the law. With this announcement, the Biden-Harris Administration is showing how we’re taking further steps not only to fix those trap doors, but also to expand opportunity to many more Americans,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “Today, more than 100 times more borrowers are eligible for PSLF than there were at the beginning of the Administration. The Biden Administration is turning a promise broken under our predecessor into a promise kept.” The debt relief announced today includes borrowers who have benefitted from the Biden-Harris Administration’s limited PSLF waiver as well as regulatory improvements made to the program by the Administration. Total relief through PSLF is now $62.5 billion for 871,000 borrowers since October 2021. Prior to the Biden-Harris Administration’s fixes to PSLF, only about 7,000 borrowers had ever received forgiveness. “The Biden-Harris Administration is proud to provide relief for another 77,700 borrowers who have given back to their communities through public service,” said U.S. Department of Education Under Secretary James Kvaal. “We hope this relief provides borrowers and their families some much needed breathing room.” An additional nearly 380,000 borrowers who are within two years, or 24 qualifying payments, of receiving forgiveness under PSLF will also receive an email from President Biden starting next week thanking them for their service and notifying them that if they continue in their public service work, they will be eligible for forgiveness within that time frame: “The Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program is an important way to bring more Americans into public service and help them get out from under the burden of student loan debt. But for too long, the program failed to live up to its commitments – and public service workers like you never got the relief you are entitled to under the law because of errors and administrative failures. I vowed to fix that, and I’m proud that my Administration has delivered on that promise,” the email from President Biden notes. “I hope you continue the important work of serving your community – and if you do, in less than two years you could get your remaining student loans forgiven through Public Service Loan Forgiveness,” the President adds. An unparalleled track record of borrower assistance The Biden-Harris Administration has taken historic steps to reduce the burden of student debt and ensure that student loans are not a barrier to opportunity for students and families. The Administration secured the largest increase to Pell Grants in a decade and finalized new rules to protect borrowers from career programs that leave graduates with unaffordable debts or insufficient earnings. And, in the wake of the Supreme Court decision on the Administration's original student debt relief plan, the Administration continues its work to pursue an alternative path to debt relief through negotiated rulemaking under the Higher Education Act. Beyond the relief under PSLF, the Biden-Harris Administration has also approved: $45.6 billion for 930,500 borrowers through improvements to income-driven repayment plans. $22.5 billion for more than 1.3 million borrowers who were cheated by their schools, saw their institutions precipitously close, or are covered by related court settlements. $11.7 billion for almost 513,000 borrowers with a total and permanent disability.

20-Mar-24,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-educations-office-civil-rights-announces-resolution-addressing-responses-harassment-based-race-sex-and-disability-and-antisemitic-harassment-park-city-school-district-utah,"U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights Announces Resolution Addressing Responses to Harassment Based on Race, Sex, and Disability and to Antisemitic Harassment in Park City School District in Utah","On March 20, 2024, the Park City School District in Utah signed a resolution agreement to resolve the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) investigation of seven complaints of unlawful harassment filed in 2023. The complaints alleged that ongoing harassment based on race, national origin (including antisemitic harassment), disability, and sex created hostile environments for students at the district’s middle school, junior high, and high school (the three schools). The district entered into an agreement to address violations and concerns OCR identified and to ensure the district complies with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 when responding to harassment based on race, national origin, sex, and disability. OCR found the district received more than 180 reports of students harassing other students based on race, national origin, sex, and disability during school years 2021-22 and 2022-23. OCR also found that the district took some action to address this harassment, such as disciplining harassing students. However, the district’s responses to repeated harassment of Black, Asian, and Jewish students and to harassment based on sex – including slurs, threats, name-calling, gestures, symbols, and assaults, among other actions that negatively affected their access to education – did not meet the district’s federal civil rights obligations. In particular, the district repeatedly failed to investigate allegations of race-based and antisemitic harassment, to take effective steps to end hostile environments based on race and antisemitic harassment that the district confirmed, and to provide complainants information about the availability of supportive measures and how to file a formal complaint of sexual harassment. In addition, OCR found that the district Title IX coordinator did not maintain all records of the district’s responses to actual notice of sexual harassment, as required by the Department’s 2020 Title IX regulations. These district failures to fulfill Title VI and Title IX responsibilities left children in school without effective responses to being repeatedly called denigrating terms that harassed students based on their race, national origin, and sex, and being physically assaulted. OCR also identified concerns regarding the district’s record keeping under Title VI and Section 504, and its apparent inadequate responses to students harassing Latino students and students with disabilities. To resolve the violations and compliance concerns OCR identified, the district agreed to: Review incidents of harassment based on race, national origin, sex, and disability in school year 2022-23, using a list of specific incidents provided by OCR, to determine for OCR’s approval what further action is needed to provide an equitable resolution of each incident. Review, revise, and disseminate districtwide policies and procedures, including for handling reports of harassment and maintaining records related to harassment. Implement new forms for tracking reports of harassment and the district’s responses. Coordinate the district’s compliance with Title IX through the Title IX coordinator. Notify students and parents about the district’s prohibitions of harassment based on race, national origin, sex, and disability and how to report harassment on these bases. Conduct a districtwide climate assessment focused on student-to-student harassment. Train all employees on Title IX coordination and related policies, procedures, and forms. Implement a plan to educate students and parents about reporting harassment. And, Report to OCR about how the district responded to reports and complaints of harassment based on race, national origin, sex, or disability in school years 2024-25 and 2025-26. “Today’s agreement commits the Park City School District to fulfill its federal civil rights obligation to ensure that all of its students can learn without discriminatory harassment in its schools,” said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon. “We look forward to active work with this district going forward to correct the gauntlet of harassment its students have had to endure, and to protect all students from targeted discrimination that impedes their equal access to education.” The resolution letter to Park City School District and the resolution agreement are available on the Office for Civil Rights website."

HIDOE was awarded $2,199,146, one of the largest Project SERV grants awarded for a natural disaster. Authorized by the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, Project SERV provides short-term funding for schools that have experienced a violent or traumatic crisis, including weather-related natural disasters, to assist in restoring a safe environment conducive to learning. “Too many communities across our country are reeling from all-too-frequent environmental disasters—and that loss and trauma carry over to our schools, educators, students, and families. Today’s announcement builds on the efforts President Biden and his entire administration have taken to support the people of Maui affected by last summer’s catastrophic wildfires and will provide much-needed assistance as they recover and look forward to a brighter future,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. The Project SERV grant awarded to HIDOE will cover 18 months of education recovery and support services and activities such as mental health personnel, trauma-recovery services training, summer academic counselors, relief staff, student transportation funding, and support for local nonpublic schools. On August 8, 2023, catastrophic wildfires devastated the island of Maui. The wildfires caused loss of life, loss of housing, damage and destruction to public and private buildings -- including schools, evacuations, extended power outages and unsafe air quality. In all, over 2,200 structures were destroyed, including King Kamehameha III Elementary School. In addition to supporting Maui schools with this Project SERV grant, the Department has actively participated in a FEMA-funded Hawaii Wildfires Interagency Recovery Mission. Since the onset of this tragedy, the Biden-Harris Administration has provided hundreds of millions of dollars in federal grants and disaster loans to support response and recovery efforts, while hundreds of personnel from across dozens of federal departments and agencies continue working with state and local partners on the ground to support Maui as it continues its long-term recovery.

This reminder, sent as a Dear Colleague Letter , is one component of the Biden-Harris Administration’s forthcoming National Strategy to Counter Islamophobia and Related Forms of Bias and Discrimination and is issued ahead of the International Day to Combat Islamophobia , which will be observed Friday, March 15. “I am deeply disturbed by increasing reports of anti-Muslim, anti-Arab, and anti-Palestinian harassment in schools,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “Hate has no place in our nation’s classrooms or on our college campuses, and the Department is committed to providing school communities with the information and resources they need to prevent and combat Islamophobia and related forms of discrimination.” The letter reminds schools of their legal obligation under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI) and its implementing regulations to provide all students with a school environment free from discrimination based on race, color, or national origin, including shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics. Further, the letter explains that schools that receive federal financial assistance from the Department have a responsibility to address discrimination against students, including Muslim, Arab, Sikh, South Asian, Hindu, and Palestinian students, when the discrimination: involves racial, ethnic, or ancestral slurs or stereotypes; is based on a student’s skin color, physical features, or style of dress that reflects both ethnic and religious traditions; or is based on the country or region where a student is from or is perceived to have come from, including, for example, discrimination based on a student’s accent or name, a student’s limited English proficiency, or a student speaking a language other than English. “OCR continues to stand ready to fulfill the promise of Title VI to ensure every student, including Muslim, Arab, Sikh, South Asian, Hindu, and Palestinian students, has equal access to educational opportunities that are free from discrimination,” said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon. The release of the letter continues the Department’s work in advancing the Biden-Harris Administration’s National Strategy to Counter Islamophobia and Related Forms of Bias and Discrimination. In November, the Department issued a fact sheet outlining various resources to keep students safe in the classroom and on campuses. Senior administration officials have also conducted site visits to schools and institutions of higher education, as well as held listening sessions with impacted communities. In addition to today’s letter, OCR has issued other resources to support schools in complying with their obligations under Title VI. These resources include: Dear Colleague Letter: Discrimination, including Harassment, Based on Shared Ancestry or Ethnic Characteristics (November 2023); Fact Sheet Protecting Students from Discrimination Based on Shared Ancestry or Ethnic Characteristics (January 2023); Dear Colleague Letter: Addressing Discrimination Against Jewish Students (May 2023), issued as part of the Department’s launch of an Antisemitism Awareness Campaign.

11-Mar-24,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/statement-secretary-cardona-presidents-fiscal-year-2025-budget,Statement by Secretary Cardona on the President's Fiscal Year 2025 Budget,"The Biden-Harris Administration today released the President's Budget for Fiscal Year 2025. Following historic progress made since the President took office—with nearly 15 million jobs created and inflation down two-thirds—the Budget protects and builds on this progress by lowering costs for working families, protecting and strengthening Social Security and Medicare, investing in America and the American people, and reducing the deficit by cracking down on fraud, cutting wasteful spending, and making the wealthy and corporations pay their fair share. ""President Biden's Budget raises the bar in education by investing in evidence-based strategies and partnerships that will improve outcomes from cradle to career,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""With these investments, we can deliver an excellent education to all students, improve learning conditions, build pathways to college and careers, and increase postsecondary education affordability and access. By answering the President's call to action, Congress would provide states and communities with invaluable resources to bolster a talented, diverse teaching workforce; expand access to multilingual programs; increase school-based mental health services; and meet the needs of children and youth with disabilities. Through this budget, the President prioritizes fiscal responsibility while making bold strides to narrow opportunity and achievement gaps. I look forward to working alongside states, schools, and communities as they leverage these investments to promote access, opportunity, and excellence for all students.""

5-Mar-24,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-imposes-14-million-fine-against-liberty-university-clery-act-violations,U.S. Department of Education Imposes $14 Million Fine Against Liberty University for Clery Act Violations,"The U.S. Department of Education (Department) today announced its office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) is imposing a $14 million fine as a result of a settlement agreement with Liberty University (Liberty) for material and ongoing violations of the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act ( Clery Act ), including with respect to its published crime statistics and treatment of sexual assault survivors. This is the largest fine ever imposed for violating the Clery Act , which requires institutions to provide important information about public safety issues to current students, parents, employees, prospective students and employees, and the public postsecondary schools participating in the federal student aid programs. As a part of the settlement, Liberty agreed to spend $2 million over the next two years for on-campus safety improvements and compliance enhancements. Progress on that work will be audited by an outside accounting firm. The Department will also conduct its post-review monitoring of Liberty through April 2026 to ensure that the school executes on promised improvements. Any further lapses in Clery Act compliance could jeopardize the terms of the University’s participation in the federal student aid programs or result in other administrative sanctions against the institution. “Students, faculty, and staff deserve to know that they can be safe and secure in their school communities. We respond aggressively to complaints about campus safety and security,” said FSA Chief Operating Officer Richard Cordray. “Through the Clery Act schools are obligated to take action that creates safe and secure campus communities, investigate complaints, and responsibly disclose information about crimes and other safety concerns. We will continue to hold schools accountable if they fail to do so.” In February 2022, FSA notified Liberty that it would conduct a program review to evaluate Liberty’s Clery Act compliance. The announcement followed the receipt of several complaints that alleged the university had engaged in a pattern of conduct that reflected serious violations of the Clery Act. In May 2023, FSA’s Clery Group issued a program review report identifying significant violations of the Clery Act by Liberty. Liberty provided FSA more information in response to the program review report, and today, FSA issued a Final Program Review Determination (FPRD) letter that upholds 11 findings in the program review report: Finding 1: Lack of administrative capability – Liberty substantially failed to develop and implement an adequate Clery Act compliance program between 2016–23, the years FSA reviewed, and did not meet its regulatory responsibilities in numerous and serious ways. Specifically, the evidence acquired shows, among other things, that Liberty failed to: 1) provide accurate and complete informational disclosures; 2) comply with a number of sexual violence prevention and response requirements, 3) issue timely warnings to advise the campus community about criminal activity that may have posed a significant or ongoing threat; 4) issue emergency notifications to advise the campus community about emergencies or dangerous situations that may have posed a threat to health or safety. Finding 2: Inaccurate and incomplete informational disclosures – In its Annual Security Report (ASR) Liberty failed to develop and implement required statements about campus safety and crime prevention policy, procedure, practice, and programs and include accurate and complete informational disclosures in its annual security reports. Finding 3: Failure to comply with Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) requirements – VAWA amended the Clery Act to expand and enhance the sexual violence prevention and response requirements that apply to all schools that participate in the federal student aid programs. Liberty failed to comply with numerous sexual violence prevention and response requirements of the Clery Act, such as providing victims of sexual violence with appropriate notice of their rights and options and deficiencies in the investigatory and adjudicative process. Finding 4: Failure to identify and notify campus security authorities and to establish an adequate system for collecting crime statistics from all required sources – Liberty failed to effectively collect required statistics for incidents of crimes reported to campus security authorities, failed to include them in its campus crime statistics, and failed to identify and notify campus security authorities of their obligations. Finding 5: Failure to properly classify and disclose crime statistics – Liberty failed to compile and publish accurate and complete crime statistics for calendar years 2016–21. FSA identified numerous instances where Liberty failed to include reported crimes in the annual security reports—including VAWA offenses—as well as numerous instances in which Liberty misidentified crimes, did not make required disclosures, and failed to properly classify crimes. Finding 6: Failure to issue emergency notifications in accordance with federal regulations – Liberty knowingly and repeatedly failed to issue the required emergency notifications to advise the campus community about emergencies and other dangerous conditions that posed a threat to the community’s health or safety. Finding 7: Failure to issue timely warnings in accordance with federal regulations – The Clery Act and Department regulations require schools to issue timely warnings to the entire campus community to inform students and employees about Clery reportable crimes that pose an ongoing threat to students and employees.These warnings must be issued whenever such crimes are reported to a campus security authority but, Liberty failed to do so. Finding 8: Failure to maintain an accurate and complete daily crime log –Schools with a police or campus security department must maintain a written, easily understood daily crime log that lists all crimes that occurred (1) on campus, including residence halls; (2) in non-campus buildings or on non-campus property; (3) on public property within the campus or immediately adjacent to and accessible from the campus; or (4) within the boundaries of the campus police or security department’s patrol zone. This reporting requirement applies to all types of crimes. Liberty failed to maintain accurate and complete daily crime logs throughout the review period. Finding 9: Failure to define Clery geography in accordance with federal regulations – Liberty did not properly apply the geographical definitions of the Clery Act , which involves identifying all buildings and properties within its “Clery Geography.” Thus, Liberty did not properly compile and report accurate crime statistics to the campus community and the Department. Finding 10: Failure to comply with Title IV record retention – Liberty failed to retain the required records necessary to establish its compliance with the Clery Act . The failure to retain these compromised the Department's ability to conduct required oversight and monitoring. Finding 11: Failure to publish and distribute Annual Security Report in accordance with federal regulations – Schools must prepare a comprehensive ASR that contains, at a minimum, all statistics and policy disclosures identified in Department regulations. Schools must actively distribute the ASR to enrolled students and current employees through appropriate publications and mailings. Additionally, schools must provide a conspicuous notice to prospective students and employees, including a statement that the ASR is available, its contents, and the URL where it is posted. In four years, from 2018 through 2021, Liberty failed to distribute the revised version of the institution’s ASR. The settlement terms require Liberty to bring its programs and operations into full compliance with the Clery Act and do so in a manner that will provide reasonable assurance that these violations will not recur. The $14 million fine and other remedial actions imposed in this settlement reflect the serious and longstanding nature of Liberty’s violations, which undermined campus safety for students, faculty, and staff. The settlement also takes into account current Liberty administration’s prompt acknowledgment of almost all the violations identified in the program review report, and its demonstrated commitment to remedying them. FSA will vigilantly monitor Liberty’s ongoing remedial actions, including the school’s increased spending on campus safety improvements. Students, parents, employees, and other stakeholders—including members of the public—can file complaints about suspected Clery Ac t violations; examples include a school misreporting crime statistics, failing to publish an Annual Security Report, discouraging individuals from reporting assaults, and failing to issue timely warnings about threats to safety. To file a Clery complaint with FSA, contact CleryComplaints@ed.gov , and provide the specifics of the alleged failure of compliance with the Clery Act and supporting documentation. To learn about or file a Title IX complaint—including complaints about sex discrimination, sexual harassment, and sexual violence—visit the Department’s Office for Civil Rights at www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/complaintintro.html ."

President Biden named tackling the mental health crisis, particularly among youth, a key pillar in his Unity Agenda for the nation. And, in line with the Administration’s goals, these programs play a key role in doubling the supply of qualified mental health professionals in our nation’s schools. These newly-opened applications build on the progress made through the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act to advance the Biden-Harris Administration’s efforts to integrate mental health services into our schools as part of the President’s National Mental Health Strategy . Many school districts across the country are facing an increased need for mental health services for their students, while at the same time, often struggling to find qualified mental health professionals to provide these services. The Administration has continued to request additional funding to sustain and expand efforts nationwide to provide more school-based health services, and pending appropriations the Department anticipates making approximately $38 million available across both competitions in Fiscal Year 2024. “Youth mental health needs have reached a crisis point, and help is available in our public schools,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “The grant competitions that the Department is opening today will build on the Biden-Harris Administration’s progress in providing vital mental health supports in our schools, help schools grow a pipeline of mental health professionals, and raise the bar in meeting students’ holistic needs. Most importantly, the funds provided through these grant programs will change students’ lives by making it easier for them to access critical services.” Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, isolation, the impact of social media, and trauma of the pandemic, youth rates of anxiety and depression, and other mental health challenges were on the rise, and too many students suffered. Mental health and wellness have profound implications for America’s students, their overall wellbeing, academic success, and other outcomes. Studies show that youth facing mental health challenges are more likely to receive services in a school-based setting. The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act presented an unprecedented opportunity to raise the bar for our support of our students, to improve teaching and learning conditions in our schools, to expand access to school-based mental health care, and to scale up and accelerate efforts across the country to train and hire a pipeline of professionals committed to the wellbeing of our students. This continued funding has the potential to meaningfully change lives by building a mental health infrastructure in schools and communities across the country. To support the mental health professional pipeline, MHSP grants support local educational agencies in partnership with institutions of higher education, in training school-based mental health services providers, with the goal of expanding the number of these professionals available to address the shortages in schools across the country. This MHSP competition also includes priorities to increase the number of mental health professionals from diverse backgrounds or the districts they serve, promote inclusive practices, and partnerships with Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal Colleges and Universities, Hispanic Serving Institutions and other minority-serving instructions. Through SBMH, high-need LEAs may receive funding to hire and increase the number of mental health professionals and the provision of services in schools. These two programs will help schools raise the bar for student mental health by recruiting, preparing, hiring, and retaining diverse and highly qualified school-based mental health providers, including in underserved communities, where access to mental health services can be limited. To date, the Biden-Harris Administration has awarded over $571 million across 264 grantees in 48 states and territories to strengthen the pipeline and increase the number of school-based mental health professionals to serve more high-need populations of students across the country. The 264 grantees supported with these previous investments are projected to help train and hire an additional 14,000 mental health professionals to provide supports to students and address their mental health needs. Investments like these help build upon the President’s larger National Mental Health Strategy , which aims to double the number of school counselors, social workers, and other mental health professionals in our nation’s schools. Notices Inviting Applications, which outline requirements to apply, have been posted to the Federal Register . Applications for SBMH are here , and due on April 30, 2024 and applications for MHSP are here , and due on May 15, 2024."
27-Feb-24,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-announces-updates-and-additional-preparation-support-2024%E2%80%9325-fafsa-implementation,U.S. Department of Education Announces Updates and Additional Preparation Support for 2024–25 FAFSA Implementation,"The U.S. Department of Education today announced updates on its progress on the 2024–25 Better FAFSA® implementation. “We are putting all hands on deck and using every lever we have to make sure we can achieve the transformational potential of the Better FAFSA to make higher education possible for many more of our nation’s students,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “The technical updates we are making today will not impact our implementation timelines, and, combined with other implementation efforts, the Department’s Better FAFSA will result in more students eligible to access more Pell Grants in the 2024–25 award year.” First, as part of the final steps in preparing to process FAFSA forms in the first half of March, the Department updated how it calculates the amount of aid students will receive in order to be in full alignment with the FAFSA Simplification Act. The update will not affect the Department’s timeline for delivering completed applications to schools in the first half of March, and combined with other implementation efforts, the Department’s Better FAFSA will result in 7.3 million students in total expected to be eligible for Pell Grants in the 2024–25 award year. Since the new 2024–25 FAFSA form became available on Dec. 30, more than 4.7 million forms have been successfully submitted. The Department will work with colleges and vendors to put this update into effect in the coming days, and it will be available to provide technical support and assistance to institutions through its FAFSA College Support Strategy . Under this strategy, the Department is deploying federal personnel, allocating $50 million in technical assistance and support, and providing tools to help schools prepare to process student records as efficiently as possible. Second, over the next week, the Department will begin to deploy support from the office of Federal Student Aid and nonprofit organizations to lower-resourced colleges as part of its FAFSA College Support Strategy. These personnel will conduct needs-assessments and provide dedicated help to schools that are preparing for, and processing, student aid offer packages. The Department has received inquiries from over 100 institutions through the Concierge Service and has already followed up with these colleges to identify the specific needs for each institution. The Department has also started proactively reaching out to additional colleges with high Pell enrollment, resource constraints, and other needs to offer support based on their needs. Third, this week the Department will send system-generated test student records (Institutional Student Information Records, or ISIRs) to schools and their vendors to process student records faster and more efficiently. System-generated test ISIRs are an important step in ensuring schools and their vendors can finalize their systems in order to process student records when they begin receiving them in the first half of March. This action builds on the test ISIRs shared with colleges earlier this month. The Department will continue to update additional test ISIRs and open-source tools stored in a public Department repository leading up to the processing date. Today’s announcements build on the progress the Department has made in implementing the Better FAFSA form and ensuring all students can access the maximum financial aid they are entitled to in order to pursue their higher education goals. In addition to starting to deliver test ISIRs earlier this month, last week the Department announced that contributors without a Social Security number will be able to successfully submit FAFSA forms in the first half of March. The Department also outlined a process that allows students affected by this issue who need to meet state and institutional aid or scholarship deadlines to submit an incomplete FAFSA form before the issue is fully resolved."
26-Feb-24,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-releases-resources-support-preschool-expansion-and-early-school-success,Biden-Harris Administration Releases Resources to Support Preschool Expansion and Early School Success,"Guidance Advances President Biden’s Work to Invest in Early Learning Today, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) released guidance for how states, local educational agencies (LEAs), and schools can use Title I funds to expand access to high-quality preschool for three- and four-year olds in a range of quality settings including schools, Head Start, and community-based organizations. This guidance will help ensure more children can experience early school success, and it encourages more schools across the nation to better set up kindergarten to be a sturdy bridge between the early years and the early grades. The Biden-Harris Administration has secured historic educational investments, including an additional $1.9 billion in annual funding for the Title I program since 2021. U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona will highlight this announcement today during a visit to an early childhood center in New Jersey. “High-quality, early learning opportunities are proven bridges to later academic success—and every child deserves access,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “With the resources we’re releasing today, the Biden-Harris Administration is helping states, LEAs, schools, and communities to reach more historically underserved children with high-quality preschool programs, strengthen community partnerships, and find strategies and tools to best support educators and staff. I’m proud that the Department is a partner in raising the bar on quality and access so that more children can benefit from expanded early learning opportunities and lay the path for early school success.” Given the clear link between high-quality preschool and student achievement, the Department has revised its Non-Regulatory Guidance on Serving Preschool Children Through Title I, Part A (Title I) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) to help states, local educational agencies (LEAs), and schools leverage these critical resources to expand access to preschool and enhance program quality. The last time this guidance was revised was in 2012, prior to the most recent reauthorization of the ESEA in 2015. The release of this guidance also follows the release of the President’s Executive Order to Increase Access to High-Quality Care and Supporting Caregivers , which directed the Department of Education to update its guidance on how schools and local educational agencies could expand access to high-quality preschool. The Department is coordinating these efforts with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to ensure quality preschool is available through a variety of settings to meet the needs of all families. The guidance includes information on how local and state education agencies can partner with local preschool programs, Head Start, and other community-based organizations to expand access to preschool opportunities through layering and braiding federal, state, and local funds. The revised guidance further describes how Title I funds can be used to support the professional development and growth of early educators. The revised guidance also highlights ways to meet the developmental and linguistic needs of preschool students, especially children with disabilities and English learners, which is essential to achieving educational equity. Expanding access to high-quality preschool has been a core priority for the Biden-Harris Administration since Day One. High-quality preschool is an effective strategy to improve academic and other outcomes for every student and prepare children for elementary school, and beyond. Research shows that when students from low-income backgrounds receive two years of high-quality preschool, followed by high-quality, instructionally aligned, full-day kindergarten, achievement gaps close and students are more likely to succeed in school and graduate from high school. The revised guidance will help schools expand high-quality preschool for more students by providing actionable information on how LEAs can utilize Title I, as well as other federal funds like Title III and IDEA Part B, to reach more children. The skills and knowledge that children acquire in their early years are the building blocks for life. By expanding access to high-quality preschool, coordinating transitions to kindergarten, and supporting teachers who educate our youngest learners, more students can have the opportunity to experience early school success, resulting in more students reaching third grade benchmarks that are crucial for high school graduation and future success. The Non-Regulatory Guidance on Serving Preschool Children Through Title I, Part A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as Amended and accompanying Early School Success Dear Colleague Letter provide more details about how states and local leaders can ensure opportunities for all young learners ."
26-Feb-24,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-releases-voter-toolkit,U.S. Department of Education Releases Voter Toolkit,"The U.S. Department of Education (Department) today released a "" Toolkit for the Promotion of Voter Participation for Students "" to provide resources for educational institutions to help them identify and implement actions to assist eligible students with voter registration and voting. Recognizing that our nation's schools, colleges, and universities have a critical role in promoting civic engagement, the toolkit will provide them with strategies to support their students. ""Voting is fundamental to our democracy, and our schools and colleges play an important role in helping our students become active participants in our democratic society,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""From providing civic education during a student's elementary and secondary school years to facilitating the voting process for all students during their postsecondary educational experience, our education system helps students engage in the electoral process. I'm proud that the resources we are releasing today will help reduce the barriers and obstacles many students—especially our underserved students—face in participating fully in our democracy."" The toolkit includes explanations of current legal requirements for schools, recommendations for non-partisan steps they can take to expand voter participation across their student bodies, federal resources they can utilize and share to support voters in their communities, and examples from the field with effective and promising strategies from schools across the nation. In March 2021, President Biden issued an executive order, "" Promoting Access to Voting ,"" which called on federal agencies to consider ways to expand opportunities for all Americans to register to vote and to obtain information about, and participate in, the electoral process. Since then, the Department has taken several steps to expand voting access for all students, including adding a link to vote.gov on the Federal Student Aid website to make information about voting more accessible to college students; issuing a Dear Colleague Letter to remind institutions of higher education of the federal requirements regarding voting that are tied to participation in federal student aid programs; and clarifying when Federal Work Study dollars could be used for nonpartisan civic engagement work. Again, the toolkit is available here ."
22-Feb-24,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-releases-state-state-breakdown-12-billion-save-plan-forgiveness,Biden-Harris Administration Releases State-by-State Breakdown of $1.2 Billion in SAVE Plan Forgiveness,"The Biden-Harris Administration today is publishing a state-by-state breakdown of the nearly 153,000 borrowers who are receiving $1.2 billion in forgiveness under President Biden’s Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) Plan. Servicers started processing this forgiveness today. “When we talk about fixing a broken student loan system, this is what we’re talking about,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “The state-by-state SAVE Plan debt forgiveness numbers we’re announcing today not only show that President Biden’s leadership is making a real impact on people’s lives in every state – they demonstrate that we won’t ever stop fighting to make higher education more affordable and accessible for more Americans. This is that commitment in action. This is the real deal.” Borrowers in every single state across the country and territories will have their loans canceled under this action. President Biden has emailed borrowers in all 50 states plus territories on Wednesday notifying them that they were approved for forgiveness and would not need to take any further action to receive relief. Servicers have begun processing the forgiveness and borrowers will see their loans forgiven on their accounts in the coming weeks. Moving forward, the U.S. Department of Education will continue to identify and discharge other borrowers enrolled in SAVE who are eligible for this forgiveness on a regular basis. For a borrower to be eligible for this forgiveness they must be enrolled in the SAVE Plan, have been making at least 10 years of payments, and have originally taken out $12,000 or less for college. For every $1,000 borrowed above $12,000, a borrower can receive forgiveness after an additional year of payments. All borrowers on SAVE receive forgiveness after 20 or 25 years, depending on whether they have loans for graduate school.

An Unparalleled Track Record of Student Debt Cancellation The Biden-Harris Administration has fought tirelessly to provide borrowers the relief they have earned. In total, the Administration has now approved debt cancellation for nearly 3.9 million hard-working Americans totaling almost $138 billion in relief. Many of these borrowers planned their lives and families around the promise of forgiveness through programs such as Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF). The Administration also secured the largest increase to Federal Pell Grants in a decade and finalized new rules to protect borrowers from career programs that leave graduates with unaffordable debts or insufficient earnings. To date the Biden-Harris Administration has also approved: $56.7 billion for more than 793,000 borrowers through fixes to PSLF. $45.6 billion for 930,500 borrowers through improvements to income-driven repayment. $11.7 billion for 513,000 borrowers with a total and permanent disability. This includes providing automatic discharges off a data match with the Social Security Administration $22.5 billion for 1.3 million borrowers through closed school discharges, borrower defense, and related court settlements. The Biden-Harris Administration is currently writing proposed regulations that would make more borrowers eligible for loan forgiveness and this week will hold another session of negotiated rulemaking to discuss a proposal to provide loan forgiveness for borrowers experiencing hardship. These efforts are part of President Biden’s commitment to finding an alternative path to student debt relief in the wake of last year’s Supreme Court decision striking down the Administration’s original student debt relief plan. The Department is also conducting negotiated rulemaking on regulations that will strengthen institutional quality and program integrity to ensure students are well served by their colleges and that the federal student aid programs work in their best interest. Additional Borrowers Enrolled in SAVE There are now 7.5 million borrowers enrolled in the SAVE Plan, of whom 4.3 million have a $0 payment. The SAVE Plan is the most-affordable repayment plan for low- and middle-income borrowers and puts many on a path to earlier forgiveness. The SAVE Plan protects borrowers from runaway interest and balances larger than what they originally took out. The improved application allows for a borrower’s income to be shared with the Internal Revenue Service so that they do not have to recertify on an annual basis The Department will implement the remaining full benefits of the SAVE Plan in July 2024, which will further reduce monthly payments from 10 percent of a borrower’s discretionary income to 5 percent.

This action comes as 7.5 million borrowers are now enrolled in SAVE, 4.3 million of whom have a $0 monthly payment. “With today’s announcement, we are once again sending a clear message to borrowers who had low balances: if you’ve been paying for a decade, you’ve done your part, and you deserve relief,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “Under President Biden’s leadership, our Administration has now approved loan forgiveness for nearly 3.9 million borrowers, and our historic fight to cancel student debt isn’t over yet.” President Biden announced in January that his Administration was accelerating the shortened time to forgiveness component of the SAVE Plan nearly six months earlier than anticipated in order to provide borrowers the relief they have earned as quickly as possible. For a borrower to be eligible for this forgiveness they must be enrolled in the SAVE Plan, have been making at least 10 years of payments, and have originally taken out $12,000 or less for college. For every $1,000 borrowed above $12,000, a borrower can receive forgiveness after an additional year of payments. All borrowers on SAVE receive forgiveness after 20 or 25 years, depending on whether they have loans for graduate school. The benefit is based upon the original principal balance of all Federal loans borrowed to attend school, not what a borrower currently owes or the amount of an individual loan. “As of today, we have approved loan relief for nearly 3.9 million borrowers who were counting on the Biden-Harris Administration to fix the broken student loan system and provide the forgiveness they earned and have been waiting for,” said U.S. Under Secretary of Education James Kvaal. “For too long the system did not work for borrowers, even when they were eligible for loan forgiveness. Today’s announcement shows that President Biden’s commitment to student debt cancellation continues to deliver.” Borrowers will begin receiving emails from President Biden today telling them they are approved for forgiveness and will not need to take any further action to receive relief. In the coming days servicers will process the forgiveness and borrowers will see their loans forgiven on their accounts. Moving forward, borrowers who meet the eligibility criteria for forgiveness under the SAVE Plan will have their loans automatically discharged with no action needed on their part. The U.S. Department of Education (Department) will continue to identify and discharge the loans on a regular basis. Next week, the Department will start emailing borrowers who can become eligible for this forgiveness if they switch onto SAVE. No action is needed by borrowers who have already enrolled in SAVE. Borrowers who believe they meet these criteria are strongly encouraged to immediately sign up for SAVE at StudentAid.gov/save .

20-Feb-24,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-educations-office-civil-rights-releases-new-resources-students-disabilities,U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights Releases New Resources on Students with Disabilities,"The Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) released four new resources today with information for students, parents and families, and schools addressing civil rights of students with disabilities, as well as a data snapshot about education access for students with disabilities drawn from OCR’s 2020-21 Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC) . OCR issued these new resources to inform students with disabilities, and their families and schools, about their legal rights under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Section 504 prohibits discrimination against students with disabilities by institutions that accept federal financial assistance, which includes almost all public schools and public and private institutions of higher education. “We issued these new resources to give students, including those with asthma, diabetes, food allergies, and GERD, as well as their families and schools, important tools to understand when and how they are protected by federal disability rights laws,” said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon. OCR’s new CRDC data snapshot reports that 8.4 million students with disabilities accounted for 17% of the overall public school enrollment in the 2020-21 school year, the most recent school year for which the Department has civil rights data. Three percent (1.6 million) of the overall student enrollment were students with disabilities who received educational aids and services under Section 504 only. The Department’s National Center for Education Statistics estimates that students with disabilities accounted for 21% of undergraduates and 11% of postbaccalaureate students in the 2019-20 school year. The four new resources address common medical conditions that can be disabilities for purposes of Section 504: asthma, diabetes, food allergies, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). These resources, which are applicable to all levels of education, explain when these medical conditions trigger protections under Section 504, what kind of modifications an educational institution may need to take to avoid unlawful discrimination, and what an institution may need to do to remedy past discrimination. OCR also released a new CRDC data snapshot profiling educational opportunities provided to public school students with disabilities during the 2020-21 school year. It reflects troubling differences in the experiences of students with disabilities compared to their non-disabled peers. For example, higher percentages of students with disabilities were physically restrained or secluded than students without disabilities. Students with disabilities were also overrepresented in disciplinary actions when compared to their total student enrollment. And students with disabilities were underrepresented in Advanced Placement courses, gifted and talented programs, and dual enrollment or dual credit programs. The new resources regarding asthma , diabetes , food allergies , and GERD are available on the OCR website . The new CRDC disability snapshot , and other CRDC data reports and snapshots , are available on the CRDC website ."

In the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision on the Administration's original student debt relief plan last summer, President Biden announced a new path to provide debt relief for as many borrowers as possible under the Department of Education’s existing rulemaking authorities. The text will be discussed as part of a negotiated rulemaking session on February 22 and 23. The proposal outlines a set of factors that could be used to identify hardship, such as a borrower’s total student loan balance and required payments relative to household income, and whether a borrower has high-cost burdens for essential expenses like healthcare or childcare. The draft specifies that the U.S. Secretary of Education may consider these and other factors to determine whether borrowers are experiencing the type of hardship that would qualify for debt relief. As one exercise of the Secretary’s authority, the proposed regulatory text would allow for automatic relief for borrowers who are highly likely to be in default in two years. These borrowers would be identified using a methodology developed by the Secretary using information in his possession. In addition to such relief, the proposed regulatory text allows the Secretary to provide additional relief to borrowers experiencing hardship through an application or an automatic process. “College is meant to lead to a better life, but too many students end up struggling due to their student debt,” said Under Secretary James Kvaal. “The ideas we are outlining today will allow us to help struggling borrowers who are experiencing hardships in their lives, and they are part of President Biden’s overall plan to give breathing room to as many student loan borrowers as possible. It’s an important part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s permanent solutions to the problem of unaffordable loans.” The current regulatory process builds on the Biden-Harris Administration’s efforts to fix existing loan forgiveness programs and create the SAVE plan, the most affordable repayment plan ever. Through this regulatory process and as part of the broader plan President Biden announced last summer, the Department previously proposed to provide debt relief for other groups of borrowers, including those who: Currently have outstanding federal student loan balances that exceed what they originally borrowed. Have loans that first entered repayment 20 or 25 years ago. Took out loans to attend career-training programs that created unreasonable debt loads or provided insufficient earnings for graduates, as well as borrowers who attended institutions with unacceptably high student loan default rates. Eligible for forgiveness under repayment plans like the SAVE Plan or targeted relief programs, or closed school loan discharges, except they have not applied for such relief. Continuing to provide debt relief and support borrowers Today’s announcement builds on the Biden-Harris Administration’s track record of fixing the student loan program and providing millions of borrowers the debt relief they need. This includes the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan, which is helping nearly 7 million borrowers manage their monthly loan payments and work toward forgiveness. Of borrowers on SAVE, 3.9 million have a $0 monthly payment, while others are saving an estimated $117 a month (just over $1,400 a year). This also includes approving over $136.6 billion in relief for more than 3.7 million borrowers through various actions including: $45.7 billion for 930,500 borrowers through administrative corrections to IDR payment counts that have brought borrowers closer to forgiveness and address longstanding concerns with the misuse of forbearance by loan servicers. $56.7 billion for 793,400 borrowers through PSLF . This includes borrowers who have benefitted from the Biden-Harris Administration’s limited PSLF waiver as well as regulatory improvements made to the program by the Administration. Prior to the Biden-Harris Administration’s fixes to PSLF, only about 7,000 borrowers had ever received forgiveness. $11.7 billion for almost 513,000 borrowers with a total and permanent disability. $22.5 billion for more than 1.3 million borrowers who were cheated by their schools, saw their institutions precipitously close, or are covered by related court settlements ."
14-Feb-24,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/fact-sheet-us-department-education-releases-2023-update-equity-action-plan-outlines-new-commitments-advance-equity,"FACT SHEET: U.S. Department of Education Releases 2023 Update to Equity Action Plan, Outlines New Commitments to Advance Equity","The U.S. Department of Education (Department) today released its 2023 Update to its Equity Action Plan , in coordination with the Biden-Harris Administration's whole-of-government equity agenda. This Equity Action Plan is part of the Department's efforts to implement the President's Executive Order on "" Further Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through The Federal Government ,"" which reaffirmed the Administration's commitment to deliver equity and build an America in which all can participate, prosper, and reach their full potential. The Department believes that our nation's future is brighter when we provide every student and every community with equitable access to an academically rigorous, well-rounded education in a safe and inclusive school. We are answering President Biden's call to prioritize equity across government by working intentionally to ensure our policies, grants, and programs address longstanding disparities in education still faced by underserved students, families, and communities. The Department has identified five areas of focus for its 2023 Equity Action Plan through visits to communities, listening sessions and roundtables with people impacted by or interested in these issues, grantee and research community discussions, Tribal consultations, formal written invitations for comment, and more. The Department will continue to engage the public on these action areas, its progress, and next steps throughout the year and beyond. Those are: Improve college access, affordability, and degree completion for underserved students to increase economic mobility. The Department aims to address barriers to college access, affordability, and completion by supporting colleges to enroll more students from underserved groups, including students of color, students from low-income backgrounds, students who are English learners, and others to raise graduation rates and close graduation rate gaps for these student populations, and offer affordable credentials of value that lead to careers offering economic mobility. Implement Maintenance of Equity requirements to ensure historically underserved students have equitable resources for learning recovery. The Department aims to ensure that school districts serving historically underserved student groups, including students of color, students from low-income backgrounds, students who are English learners, students experiencing homelessness, and others have the resources they need to support learning recovery. This includes the allocation of $122 billion in American Rescue Plan (ARP) funds for Title I schools, and the ARP's Maintenance of Equity requirements to protect high poverty schools from reductions in State and local education funding. Address inequities faced by justice-impacted individuals by expanding access to postsecondary learning opportunities that improve outcomes for communities and reduce recidivism rates. The Department aims to ensure that our society is more just and equitable through supporting better opportunities for education during periods of incarceration and post-release. Current initiatives are set to improve the well-being of people who are incarcerated and increase successful reentry outcomes, smoothing pathways to further education, increasing workforce readiness and engagement, and reducing recidivism and preventing crime. This includes the partnerships that exist between institutions of higher education, correctional agencies, accrediting agencies, and community-based organizations. Advance equity in and through career and technical education. The Department aims to invest in career and technical education to create new and inclusive pathways to well-paying jobs and upward mobility. This includes leveraging data to promote strategies that reduce segregation by gender, race, and ethnicity in high school career and technical education (CTE) programs. Increase mental health resources with an emphasis on underserved communities, from the historic legislation and funding provided by the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. The Department aims to address the youth mental health crisis by working with states to support local educational agencies (LEAs) with high rates of poverty through three top priorities: (1) increasing the skills and knowledge of existing school personnel to support the mental health needs of students; (2) increasing the supply of mental health professionals who can work with students; and (3) increasing funding through the Medicaid program to support school health services, including mental health services. As noted in the 2023 update, since the release of its first-ever Equity Action Plan in 2022, the Department has taken bold action to advance equity including, the highlights below: Promoted Educational Opportunity and Diversity in Colleges and Universities: In the wake of the Supreme Court ruling last summer limiting the ability of colleges to consider an applicant's race in and of itself as a factor in deciding whether to admit an applicant, the Department provided colleges and universities with guidance on what admissions practices and programs remain lawful to ensure diversity, convened a National Summit on Educational Opportunity , and released a report on strategies for increasing diversity and educational opportunity. Awarded over $40 million in GEAR UP and TRIO Upward Bound grants in FY 2023 for programs focused on helping low-income students, first-generation students, and students with disabilities gain access to college. Approved additional debt relief through fixes to income-drive repayment (IDR) and Public Student Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) programs and granting automatic relief for borrowers with total and permanent disabilities, bringing the total approved debt cancellation to more than $127 billion for more than 3.6 million Americans. Rolled out implementation of the SAVE plan this fall , which is the most affordable repayment plan ever created, and has already enrolled more than 4 million borrowers. Re-launched the Raise the Bar: Attaining College Excellence & Equity initiative with a summit this spring focused on data-driven improvement efforts to equitably increase completion rates for students of color and low-income students. Funded 264 grants with $1 billion in Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA) funds to more than 40 states to increase the supply of school-based mental health professionals under the School-Based Mental Health Services Grant and the Mental Health Services Professional Demonstration (MHSPD) Grant Program. Reminded schools of their legal obligations to address discrimination , and issued Guiding Principles for creating safe, inclusive, supportive, and fair school climates. Additionally, the Department released a Resource Document on confronting racial discrimination in student discipline, and a Toolkit for creating inclusive and nondiscriminatory school environments for LGBTQI+ students. The Department's ""Raise the Bar: Lead the World"" agenda tackles these inequities head on with an emphasis on accelerating learning in our schools, strengthening supports for students' mental health and wellbeing, empowering educators and multilingual learners, and reimagining pathways to college and careers. Together, we can build an education system that ensures all students have opportunities to discover their passion, find their purpose, and realize their potential.

13-Feb-24,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-holds-first-ever-interagency-youth-policy-summit-cultivating-possibilities,Biden-Harris  Administration Holds First-Ever Interagency Youth Policy Summit: Cultivating  Possibilities,"The Biden-Harris Administration brought together nearly 90 young people from across the nation at the U.S. Department of Education today for the first-ever interagency Youth Policy Summit: Cultivating Possibilities. The summit, which was designed and planned in partnership with youth, gave policymakers from federal agencies a chance to hear directly from young people and learn from one another about how to improve policies and programs to ensure that all youth have the opportunity to thrive. Since taking office, the Biden-Harris Administration has consistently engaged with, partnered alongside, and delivered for young people across the nation – from supporting mental health and lowering the cost of living, to tackling the climate crisis and cancelling student debt. In an effort to continue hearing from and being informed by young people, within the next six months, the U.S. Department of Education will reconvene these youth participants and federal agencies virtually, sustaining the two-way dialogue that began at the summit. “Our young people are always our most important stakeholders in education. Today’s youth policy summit is an important reminder that youth are also leaders of both today and tomorrow— and key partners in the policy discussions that effect their lives. That's why the Biden-Harris Administration is working to ‘ Raise the Bar ’ for student outcomes and young people’s well-being by centering youth voices,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “Our nation’s youth are passionate and engaged, and they are raising their voices in their schools and advocating for critical issues that matter to them in their communities, including access to quality, affordable education that expands their horizons, opportunities for mentorship and training to succeed in a 21st century economy, mental health supports, and safety from the all-too-present threat of gun violence. The Biden-Harris Administration hears our youth and is committed to ensuring that every young person in every community can thrive.” The U.S. Department of Labor’s Employment and Training Administration is launching the Youth Apprentice Pathway Pilot, as a strategy for creating a no-wrong-door pathway for young people into federal service at ETA. Modeling a commitment to quality career pathways into federal service and other industries for young people is a key tenet of the ETA Youth Employment Works strategy. Through this pilot, the Labor Department helps model ways federal agencies can partner with Registered Apprenticeship Intermediaries to create high-quality career pathways to good jobs. “Hearing from young people at today’s youth policy summit underscored for me the deep connection between a person’s wellbeing and the quality and availability of jobs that they can build their lives around,” said Acting U.S. Secretary of Labor Julie Su. “The Department of Labor is committed to delivering on President Biden’s commitment to support young people and expand access to opportunity by ensuring there is no wrong door through which young people can access the training, skills and supportive services they need to get good jobs that can change their lives and the lives of their families. With our youth apprenticeship pilot and the hire youth pledge , we are encouraging our federal, state and local partners to provide the resources and supports that young people need to feel empowered to have a full voice in the workforce.” “Young people in this country are dealing with a lot of serious challenges right now, and they deserve our full support. That’s why President Biden has put forward a comprehensive national strategy to tackle our behavioral health crisis and ensure that supports and services are available wherever and whenever young people need them,” said U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra. “We know that behavioral health is health and that there should be ‘no wrong door’ to accessing services and supports. At HHS, we’re engaging our entire Department to transform how behavioral health is understood, accessed, treated and integrated. We have invested historic amounts of funding in 988, the suicide and crisis hotline, counselors in schools, overdose treatments and more. These investments are not only an investment in our young people, they’re an investment in our future.” The Summit included several panel discussions around federal policies and programs and their intersection with developmental goals in adolescence: Wellbeing, Belonging, Purpose, Identity and Meaning-making, Agency and Decision-making, and Leadership and Contribution. Youth and key systems leaders within youth-serving agencies and organizations (across education, child welfare, housing, juvenile justice, justice, employment, health and mental health) discussed how policy decisions and alignment across systems can better serve youth and young adults - especially those furthest from opportunity. Featured speakers in the discussions included Secretaries Cardona, Becerra, and Su, while additional agencies including the Department of Homeland Security, Department of Housing and Urban Development and Department of Justice also participated in the summit. “At this pivotal juncture, a rare and invaluable opportunity is encapsulated within this youth summit— a chance for those running this country to listen directly to those living with the policies they create. This gathering brings together a young, vibrant, and diverse array of voices from various backgrounds and life experiences, converging to share their perspectives and policy recommendations,” said Naomi Cruz Ojeda, one of the youth policy summit participants. “Valuing the perspective of young adults creates a symbiotic relationship: young people inform decision-makers while they grow in confidence that they can make a positive impact. Young people, like myself, must remind the government that policies won't be effective if we do not listen to the young voices being impacted. I am honored to be included as a part of the planning committee of this event, and that several brilliant young advocates from the Young Invincibles’ network will be joining to share their expertise. I hope the contributions from us and the other young people in attendance will create blueprints for new ideas to make progress."" To help carry forward the policy ideas and partnerships from this summit, the Funders for Adolescent Science Translation announced a commitment of $600,000. A portion of this commitment will be dedicated to microgrants for the youth and organizations connected to the summit to follow up and work more deeply together on advancing federal youth policy. Funders include: The Annie E. Casey Foundation, The Bezos Family Foundation, The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, The Ford Foundation, The Hemera Foundation, The Conrad N. Hilton Foundation, Hopelab, Pivotal Ventures, The Raikes Foundation, Spring Point Partners, The Seattle Foundation and The Stuart Foundation."
13-Feb-24,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-announces-latest-steps-support-schools-and-students-better-fafsa%C2%AE,U.S. Department of Education Announces Latest Steps to Support Schools and Students with Better FAFSA,"U.S. Department of Education Announces Latest Steps to Support Schools and Students with Better FAFSA® The U.S. Department of Education (Department) today announced additional steps to help colleges prepare to process student financial aid forms as efficiently as possible. The Department’s top priority is to ensure students can access the maximum financial aid possible to help them pursue their higher education goals and bring college in reach for more Americans. Since the new 2024–25 FAFSA form became available on Dec. 30, nearly 4 million forms have been successfully submitted. The new steps announced today will make it easier for schools to process records and spend more time helping students by considerably reducing verification requirements, suspending routine school compliance reviews, and providing flexibility on renewing participation in the federal student aid programs. In addition, by Feb. 16, the Department will release test versions of Institutional Student Information Records (ISIRs) for schools to prepare their systems and launch open-source tools to support institutions using test ISIRs. These steps build upon the FAFSA College Support Strategy , which U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona announced last week. Under this strategy, the Department is deploying federal personnel to support under-resourced colleges, standing up a concierge service, allocating $50 million in funding for technical assistance and support, and releasing tools to help institutions prepare. “We are determined to drive a constant drumbeat of action to fulfill the transformational potential of the Better FAFSA,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona, “The steps we’re announcing today build on the Better FAFSA College Support Strategy by making it easier for colleges and universities to get financial aid packages to students and families as quickly as possible. We will strive to leave no stone unturned to make this FAFSA process easier and simpler for colleges, universities, and students.” Making it easier and more efficient for schools to process student records Today, the Department is announcing steps to help colleges process student records faster and more efficiently. This includes: Significantly reducing verification requirements. This year, the Department will be significantly reducing verification requirements, while continuing key measures focused on avoiding identity fraud. In past years, the Department selected a much larger portion of FAFSA applicants for colleges to verify. More recently, the Department has gradually reduced that verification rate to more effectively target verification efforts while alleviating burdens for millions of students and thousands of schools. With the implementation of the direct data exchange with the IRS, made possible by this year’s overhauled FAFSA form, the Department is receiving the vast majority of income data directly from the IRS, which will not need to be verified. This year’s significant reduction in verifications will reduce the burden for colleges and students while continuing to protect against fraud. Suspending new routine program reviews. As part of its oversight duties, the Department routinely conducts program reviews to confirm a college meets the Department’s requirements for institutional eligibility, financial responsibility, and administrative capability. The Department will suspend all new program reviews through June 2024, except for those related to the most serious issues like suspected fraud or a severe breach of fiduciary duty. Institutions with an ongoing program review can also request extensions for responses to program reviews, reports, or requests for additional documentation. This flexibility will reduce the time that colleges’ financial aid offices need to devote to producing documentation and responding to Department inquiries during the time they need to focus on quickly getting aid award offers to students. Providing additional flexibility on recertification. Institutions are currently required to recertify eligibility for the Department’s federal student aid programs no later than 90 days before their Program Participation Agreement (PPA) expires. The Department will waive that 90-day requirement for schools whose PPA expires in March, June, or September 2024, meaning these schools have until their expiration day to submit a recertification application. Providing this flexibility will give time back to institutions at a critical moment and enable them to focus their resources on getting students the aid they need. Deploying expertise, funding, and tools to help colleges make the most of Better FAFSA These steps build upon the work underway to support colleges and students through the Department’s FAFSA College Support Strategy: Deploying federal personnel. The Department’s office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) is deploying teams of federal experts to under-resourced schools. Through this effort, the Department will serve colleges that need additional personalized help, including HBCUs and TCUs that would like the support. Schools will be selected based on a number of criteria, including percentage of Pell students, resource constraints, and other indications of need. Starting this week, FSA will be reaching out to a first set of schools to offer support and expects to start deploying teams in the next two weeks. In addition, over the past week, the Department has created a new concierge service within FSA, which is providing a broad set of colleges direct contact with financial aid experts to provide them personalized support based on the institution’s needs Dedicating funding to provide technical assistance and support. The Department is allocating $50 million in federal funding that will be provided to non-profit groups specializing in financial aid support and services. These groups will use these funds to recruit financial aid professionals to provide additional technical assistance and support, beyond the federal teams deployed by the Department, for under resourced colleges. Participating colleges will receive additional staff support to deliver services such as assessing financial aid system readiness and implementing necessary updates, training staff, developing aid packages, and carrying out other student aid compliance requirements. Delivering test student financial aid records by the end of the week. By Feb. 16, the Department will begin releasing test versions of Institutional Student Information Records (ISIRs). These test ISIRs will enable colleges and their critical partners to prepare their own systems and processes to efficiently assemble aid packages. In addition, the Department will also provide open-source tools to support institutions using test ISIRs."
8-Feb-24,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/federal-student-aid-reaches-settlement-agreement-international-education-corporation-student-aid-eligibility-violations,Federal Student Aid Reaches Settlement Agreement with International Education Corporation for Student Aid Eligibility Violations,"The U.S. Department of Education today announced a settlement agreement with for-profit school owner International Education Corporation (IEC) and its subsidiaries – Florida Career College (FCC) and United Education Institute (UEI), which also uses the brand name, UEI College (UEIC) – related to violations of the ability-to-benefit (ATB) test regulations. These regulations govern eligibility to receive federal student aid for students who do not have a high school diploma or GED equivalent. In 2023, a Department investigation found that FCC routinely broke the rules governing how schools can administer ATB tests. The Department found that, among other wrongdoing, FCC, and senior leaders of IEC pressured proctors to pass students and inappropriately influenced test outcomes to boost enrollment of students who receive federal aid to attend IEC schools. The Department also found that FCC test proctors and employees filled in or changed answers after students finished their tests, helped students during testing or took tests for them, and allowed students to use calculators in violation of testing rules. This misconduct aimed to maximize enrollment and school profits, by recruiting and enrolling students regardless of their ability to benefit from the program. More than half of the FCC students enrolled through ATB tests withdrew from the program with no degree, but significant student loan debt. The settlement announced today comes after an investigation into UEI/UEIC for ATB violations similar to those the Department found at FCC. Specifically, the settlement agreement: Finalizes the Department’s termination of FCC’s participation in the federal student aid programs and ends any further appeals by the school. Limits UEI/UEIC’s continued participation in the federal student aid programs by imposing strict conditions for three years that, among other things, prohibit the school from relying on ATB exams to qualify students for enrollment with federal student aid funds, and require preservation of marketing and recruiting materials for continued Departmental oversight. Requires, as a condition of UEI’s continued participation in the federal student aid programs, the separation of IEC’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer, who led the company during the widespread wrongdoing. And, Requires that IEC provide the Department a letter of credit of more than $6 million, which the Department can use to pay for any liabilities or loan discharges related to the misconduct at issue. As part of this resolution, the Department’s office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) agreed that future administrative actions based on this conduct will be limited to recovery for loan discharges and other liabilities paid to the $6 million letter of credit. “This strong agreement with International Education Corporation demonstrates Federal Student Aid’s commitment to holding schools and individuals accountable for abiding by the laws and regulations that govern the federal student aid programs,” said FSA Chief Operating Officer Richard Cordray. “Our Enforcement Office will continue to investigate reports of wrongdoing by schools and individuals to protect the integrity of our programs.” The full settlement agreement announced today is available on the Department’s FOIA Reading Room . Violations of the ATB regulations The purpose of ATB tests is to provide a path for students who do not have a high school diploma or GED equivalent to access federal financial aid by passing a test designed to demonstrate that they can benefit from postsecondary education. Applicants who fail to demonstrate their ability to benefit when tested are more likely to fail or drop out of their academic programs and to incur student loan debts that they may not be able to afford to repay.To ensure that schools do not improperly influence test administration to boost enrollment and that students do not end up with debt they cannot repay, the regulations require that ATB tests must be administered independently from the school the student seeks to attend. Violations of the rules and regulations governing the ATB testing process significantly harm impacted students and the integrity of thefederal student aid programs. FCC officials’ interference in ATB test administration harmed students and the Title IV programs. From Award Year 2016 to 2021, between 53% and 57% of FCC’s ATB students withdrew from their programs each year without obtaining a certificate. Nevertheless, the students who withdrew and could not obtain a credential face financial burdens for having enrolled. During the four years preceding the Department’s action, between 81% and 88% of the ATB students who withdrew from FCC still incurred debt or exhausted their Federal Pell Grant eligibility—usually both. As a result, these applicants have been denied future opportunities to receive financial assistance and are, arguably, worse off than if they had never attended the school. Protecting students In addition to holding officials from IEC, FCC, and UEI/UEIC accountable, FSA has supported students as FCC exits the federal student aid programs. Specifically, FSA worked with FCC’s accrediting agency and state higher education officials to help students understand their options to enroll at other schools. FSA also provided students information about how to seek an applicable loan discharge, such as a false certification discharge if the students wrongfully were enrolled through ATB testing or a borrower defense discharge if FCC misled students or engaged in other misconduct. In its enforcement actions against FCC in 2023, the Department prohibited the school from enrolling new students, but permitted it to continue offering federal student aid until Jan. 31, 2024, to allow time for then-enrolled students to complete their program of study at FCC if they wanted to. On Jan. 30, 2024, FCC officials informed the Department the school will close on Feb. 15, 2024. Because the Department prohibited new enrollments beginning in April 2023, no remaining students receiving federal student aid will be attending FCC by the date of closure. This week, the Department will update information for former FCC students at StudentAid.gov/announcements-events/florida-career-college . Today’s action demonstrates the Department’s ongoing commitment to enforcing higher education laws and regulations and protecting students, taxpayers, and the integrity of the federal student aid programs."
5-Feb-24,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-deploys-federal-personnel-funding-and-resources-support-colleges-students-and-families-better-fafsa%C2%AE,"U.S. Department of Education Deploys Federal Personnel, Funding, and Resources to Support Colleges, Students, and Families with Better FAFSA®","The U.S. Department of Education (Department) today released a FAFSA College Support Strategy to provide additional personnel, funding, resources, and technology to help schools and students complete the better FAFSA form and to help colleges prepare to process student records as quickly and accurately as possible. The Department’s top priority is to ensure students can access the maximum financial aid possible to help them pursue their higher education goals and bring college in reach for more Americans. Since the new 2024–25 FAFSA form became available on Dec. 30, more than 3.6 million forms have been successfully submitted. The Department’s FAFSA College Support Strategy includes: Deploying federal personnel and expertise to help colleges prepare and process financial aid forms Directing funding for technical assistance and support for under resourced colleges Releasing tools to help colleges prepare to quickly and accurately process student records and deliver financial aid packages “Make no mistake: the Better FAFSA is transformational,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “We are determined to get this right. We must, and we will. Our hope is that these steps we’re announcing today are going to go a long way toward helping colleges and universities make the most of the Better FAFSA.” The Department’s FAFSA College Support Strategy will particularly focus on lower-resourced schools that may have a smaller number of administrative staff and may utilize older software systems. The Department’s goal is to not only deploy resources for colleges to accelerate the development of student aid packages, but also to make sure students have adequate time to make important decisions about their higher education options. As supported by the American Council on Education and others, the Department welcomes institutions providing students and families as much flexibility as possible and as much time as possible to review aid offers to make enrollment decisions. Deploying federal personnel and expertise to colleges The Department will be deploying federal financial aid experts to a group of lowered-resourced colleges to ensure these colleges have the tools and information needed to process financial aid packages, understand the steps they need to take to prepare, deliver direct on-campus support, and provide ongoing consultations and trainings as needed. Through this effort, the Department expects to serve Historically Black Colleges and Universities, tribal colleges and universities, and colleges that are lower-resourced. The Department is also standing up a new concierge service within the office of Federal Student Aid , which will provide a broad set of colleges direct contact with financial aid experts to help to provide them personalized support based on an institution’s needs. These federal liaisons, many of whom are former financial aid professionals, will answer questions and connect colleges to available resources. Providing funding for technical assistance and on-the-ground support The Department is allocating $50 million in federal funding that will be provided to non-profit groups specialized in financial aid support and services. These groups will use these funds to recruit financial aid professionals to provide additional technical assistance and support, beyond the federal teams deployed by the Department, for under resourced colleges. Participating colleges will receive additional staff support to deliver services such as assessing financial aid system readiness and implementing necessary updates, training staff, developing aid packages, and carrying out other student aid compliance requirements. The federal funding will be administered by the Educational Credit Management Corporation and will engage experienced nonprofits like the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators and the Partnership for Education Advancement. Releasing data and tools to help colleges prepare to quickly and accurately process student records, deliver financial aid packages The Department will begin releasing test versions of institutional student financial aid information records (ISIRs) within the next two weeks and will be actively working with financial aid system developers so that colleges and states can prepare their systems. These test ISIRs will enable colleges to prepare their own systems and processes to efficiently assemble aid packages. On Friday, the Department began posting new data and resources to help schools drive FAFSA completion and improve the user experience for the new 2024–25 FAFSA. The Department released data by high school on their students’ 2024–25 FAFSA submissions, two months ahead of schedule. Originally planned to be released starting in April 2024, the Department is now providing weekly updates to allow high schools to track progress, target supports, and encourage their students to submit a FAFSA form. In addition, to continue to ensure the 2024–25 FAFSA form successfully improves the user experience—particularly for students and their families—the Department announced a new resource, at StudentAid.gov/fafsatips , that gives FAFSA applicants and contributors tips to help them successfully complete and submit the 2024–25 FAFSA form."
31-Jan-24,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-continues-rulemaking-process-provide-debt-relief-more-student-loan-borrowers,Biden-Harris Administration Continues Rulemaking Process to Provide Debt Relief for More Student Loan Borrowers,"The Biden-Harris Administration today announced that it will hold an additional negotiated rulemaking session on February 22 and 23 focused on the issue of providing relief for borrowers experiencing hardship. This session is a continuation of the critical work that started last summer when the Administration announced it would be pursuing a new regulatory process to deliver student debt relief to as many borrowers as possible. These efforts build on the Administration’s approval of more than $136.6 billion in targeted relief for over 3.7 million Americans through various actions. The session will focus exclusively on the issues related to hardship, including regulatory text provided at least a week in advance for review by the negotiators and the public. Sessions will be held virtually from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. eastern time. There will also be one hour of public comment from 3 p.m. to 4 p.m. at the end of the first day. “The Biden-Harris Administration will never stop working to deliver student debt relief for borrowers,” said Under Secretary James Kvaal. “We look forward to discussing another avenue for borrower relief related to hardship at our next negotiation session.” The Department is separately continuing its work on draft rules covering the other issues discussed at the third session, for publication later this year. This includes relief for borrowers whose balances exceed what they originally borrowed, who first entered repayment long ago, who are eligible for relief but have not applied for it, or who attended programs or institutions that failed to provide sufficient financial value. Those issues will not be discussed at this session because the Department has already sought consensus on that regulatory text. Updates on the student debt relief negotiated rulemaking process will be posted here . This includes a transcript and archived video of the sessions. Members of the public who wish to view the sessions or provide public testimony can also find a link on that page where they can register to do so. The public will have an opportunity to submit written comments on the draft rules when they are published later this year. Continuing to provide debt relief and support borrowers Today’s announcement builds on the work the Biden-Harris Administration has already done to improve the student loan program and make higher education more affordable. This includes approving over $136.6 billion in relief for more than 3.7 million borrowers through various actions, including: $45.7 billion for 930,500 borrowers through administrative adjustments to IDR payment counts that have brought borrowers closer to forgiveness and address longstanding concerns with the misuse of forbearance by loan servicers. $56.7 billion for 793,400 borrowers through PSLF. This includes borrowers who have benefitted from the Biden-Harris Administration’s limited PSLF waiver as well as regulatory improvements made to the program by the Administration. Prior to the Biden-Harris Administration’s fixes to PSLF, only about 7,000 borrowers had ever received forgiveness. $11.7 billion for almost 513,000 borrowers with a total and permanent disability. $22.5 billion for more than 1.3 million borrowers who were cheated by their schools, saw their institutions precipitously close, or are covered by related court settlements. The Biden-Harris Administration remains committed to making college more affordable and also ensuring student debt is not a roadblock to obtaining a college degree or credential and planning for the future. The Administration launched the most affordable student loan repayment plan ever—the SAVE Plan—last year, has made the largest increase to Pell Grants in a decade, and has charted a course to double the maximum Pell Grant and make community college free to enhance college affordability and reduce student debt. The Administration is also holding institutions accountable for unaffordable debts and recently finalized regulations that would set standards for graduate earnings and debt outcomes for career programs, while enhancing transparency for all programs to give students the information they need to make informed choices."

The new data comes a little more than three weeks after the Department announced more than one million FAFSA forms had been submitted and the form’s 24/7 accessibility. Additionally, the Department has updated the supporting tables used in the Student Aid Index (SAI) calculation—which replaced the Expected Family Contribution formula—that account for inflation. The updated SAI tables will allow students to benefit from an additional $1.8 billion in aid and ensure that all students can access the maximum financial aid they are eligible for. “The Better FAFSA makes it as simple and easy as possible for families to get help paying for college, and updating our tables will help even more students get the help they need” said Under Secretary of Education James Kvaal. “Updating our calculations will help students qualify for as much financial aid as possible. Thank you to the financial aid advisers, college counselors, and many others helping us put students first.” “Students, parents, and families continue to share with us how easy and fast it is to complete and submit the 2024–25 FAFSA form,” said Federal Student Aid Chief Richard Cordray. “We remain committed to ensuring students and families have stable and secure access to more than $114 billion in federal financial aid. We know how crucial this support is to pursue higher education, particularly for the most underserved communities, and the positive ripple effects an education beyond high school makes in the lives of millions, their communities, and the country.” To further support schools and state agencies, the Department will begin transmitting batches of FAFSA information—known as the Institutional Student Information Record or ISIR—to these partners in the first half of March. Students will also be able to make corrections to their form starting in the first half of March. We are continuing to test several vendor-built systems and we will provide regular progress updates to schools and stakeholders as we move forward. A Better FAFSA Form The launch of the simplified, redesigned, and streamlined 2024–25 FAFSA form ensures 610,000 more students from low-income backgrounds receive Federal Pell Grants. Additionally, Pell recipients will receive more aid with nearly 1.5 million more students receiving the maximum Pell Grant. Today’s new FAFSA data underscores the Biden-Harris Administration’s vision and commitment to deliver the most significant overhaul of the FAFSA form since its inception, almost four decades ago. Continued Commitment to Support a Better FAFSA Experience for All The Department has been working tirelessly to ensure the 2024–25 FAFSA form successfully improves the user experience for all users, particularly students and their families. The Department remains committed to provide helpful tools and information for students and parents on StudentAid.gov including notifying—via email—previous FAFSA applicants who have not yet submitted a 2024–25 FAFSA form; and provide resources and support for counselors, mentors, college access organizations, postsecondary schools, and state agencies through webinars and updates on FSA Partner Connect ."

The district entered into an agreement to ensure it complies with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 when responding to discrimination based on race, color, and national origin, including antisemitic harassment of its students. OCR’s investigation established that peers targeted the student for harassment because she is Jewish, including classmates throwing a paper airplane at her with “Blood of the Jews” and multiple swastikas as well as bloody imagery scrawled on it. Approximately ten minutes later, in the same area of the school, classmates raised their arms in a “Heil Hitler” salute apparently towards the student. One week later, the student discovered a swastika drawn on her desk. During the same school year, swastikas were drawn on a desk that the student used in a classroom on two separate occasions. While the district responded to most harassing incidents the student experienced, these responses were often haphazard; were inconsistently enforced as well as inconsistently reflected in district documentation; did not consistently include effective or timely steps to mitigate the effects of the harassment on the student or other students; and did not appear to respond to escalating and repeated incidents. To resolve the concerns OCR identified regarding the effectiveness of the district response, the district agreed to: Offer to reimburse the student’s parents for past counseling, academic, or therapeutic services they obtained for the student as a result of the antisemitic harassment the student experienced. Widely publicize an anti-harassment statement. Review its policies and procedures to ensure that they adequately address Title VI’s prohibition on discrimination based on race, color, and national origin, including discrimination based on a student’s actual or perceived shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics. Develop or revise its procedure for documenting the school’s investigation of reports of harassment. Annually train all administrators, faculty, and staff at the school on Title VI’s prohibition of discrimination based on race, color, and national origin, including on the basis of shared ancestry and ethnic characteristics. Annually train school staff, including school-level administrators who are directly involved in processing, investigating, and/or resolving complaints and other reports of discrimination based on race, color, and national origin, including harassment based on shared ancestry and ethnic characteristics. Provide an age-appropriate informational program for students at the school to address discrimination based on race, color, and national origin, including harassment based on shared ancestry and ethnic characteristics. Conduct an audit of all complaints received during the 2023-2024 school year addressing discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin, including harassment on the basis of shared ancestry and ethnic characteristics, to ensure consistency of the application of and compliance with the district’s policies and procedures. Conduct an audit of all incidents at the school coded as “Inappropriate Behavior” and “Abusive Language/Gestures” during the 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 school year to determine if any of the incidents constituted discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin, including harassment on the basis of shared ancestry and ethnic characteristics, and if so, take appropriate steps to remedy the harassment on any affected students. And, Conduct a climate survey with students and provide OCR a summary of the survey results and the district’s proposed corrective actions in response to the survey results for OCR approval. “This important agreement requires the Red Clay Consolidated District to fulfill its federal civil rights obligation to ensure that all of its students, including Jewish students, can learn safely and without discriminatory harassment in its schools,” said Catherine E. Lhamon, assistant secretary for civil rights. “We look forward to active work with this district going forward to protect Jewish students, and all students, from targeted discrimination that impedes their equal access to education.” The letter to Red Clay Consolidated School District is available here and the resolution agreement is available here ."
25-Jan-24,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-issues-new-resource-school-administrators-importance-safe-firearm-storage,U.S. Department of Education Issues New Resource for School Administrators on Importance of Safe Firearm Storage,"Safe storage of firearms is an important prevention tool that can be used to help keep schools, homes, and communities safe from gun violence. To build further awareness of this important strategy, today the Readiness and Emergency Management for Schools (REMS) Technical Assistance (TA) Center, funded by the U.S. Department of Education (Department), is releasing a new resource that schools can use to communicate with parents and families about the importance of safe firearm storage, and encourage more people to take preventive action by safely storing firearms. Additionally, First Lady Jill Biden, U.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona, and White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention Director Stef Feldman will hold a town hall with school principals today at the White House to elevate the importance of safe firearms storage and emphasize the role that principals and education leaders can play in helping prevent gun violence. “Gun-related injuries and deaths are a heartbreaking public health crisis, and it will take action from all of us to better protect our children,” said Secretary Cardona. “We know that keeping guns locked and securely stored is one of the most effective tools we have for keeping kids safe and preventing senseless tragedies. The resources released today by the Biden-Harris Administration will empower principals, school officials, and families to better address the issue of safe firearm storage in our communities as we continue to press Congress for greater action on gun violence.” Nearly 20 percent of childhood deaths are caused by firearms, and many deaths can be prevented through safe storage of firearms. The resource released today to principals and district leaders can be used to communicate with parents, families, and communities on the importance of safe firearm storage. The resource is accompanied by a letter from Secretary Cardona encouraging principals to take action. By increasing awareness around safe firearm storage, we can help to reduce the risk that weapons get into the wrong hands and save families and communities from what can tragically result when this happens. While safe firearm storage is an important factor in preventing death and injury from gun violence, direct and indirect exposure to guns can negatively affect the mental health and well-being of students. The Biden-Harris Administration, through the American Rescue Plan, the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA), and other grant programs, has provided unprecedented funding to establish safe, healthy, and supportive learning opportunities and environments; to increase access to school-based mental health services; and to strengthen the pipeline of mental health professionals in high-need communities. These historic investments provide greater access to the preventative supports that help keep students safe and healthy. Building on this foundation, earlier this month, the Department additionally announced $6.4 million in new Project Prevent awards to implement community- and school-based strategies to prevent and mitigate the impacts of community violence, and to address the impacts of exposure to community violence. These investments help advance the President’s Mental Health Strategy, which directly implements his Unity Agenda priority to tackle the mental health crisis in our school communities. In addition, funding for mental health complements the Administration’s continued focus on its Raise the Bar: Lead the World initiative . Guidance on the importance of proper firearm storage comes on the heels of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) announcing approximately $50 million in new grants, made possible by BSCA, for states to implement, enhance, and expand the use of school-based health services through Medicaid. The grants will provide up to $2.5 million each to as many as 20 states to expand crucial access to mental health and physical health services at schools under the Medicaid program. Secretary Cardona joined U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra in issuing a letter this week to states encouraging them to make use of this new funding to ensure that as many schools as possible are providing mental and physical health services at schools and extending the reach of these services to impact more children. The grants hold promise for connecting millions more American children to critical health care services, particularly for mental health. The work on safe storage of firearms is part of a broader Administration-wide effort led by the newly established White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, which highlights the importance of this key preventative strategy in communities across the country. This work builds on crucial actions taken by the President and this Administration in addressing the epidemic of gun violence through BSCA, including funding to help ensure deadly weapons are kept out of the hands of individuals a court has determined to be a significant danger to themselves or others; enhanced background checks for buyers under 21; and new funding for proven, community-based violence prevention initiatives."

This investment, issued by the U.S. Department of Education (Department), builds the capacity of education and workforce systems to partner with business and industry, to develop new high-quality career-connected high school programs for more students. Grantees will leverage four evidence-based strategies, or “keys,” to help students in unlocking career success including: providing postsecondary education and career guidance; increasing access to dual or concurrent enrollment programs; increasing work-based learning opportunities; and providing industry-recognized credentials. “President Biden understands that it’s time to invest in career-connected learning that will better prepare our young people for exciting careers and family-sustaining jobs in today’s most in-demand fields,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “We can transform the American high school experience and raise the bar for student engagement, achievement, and career-readiness in this country by providing all students with access to dual enrollment classes, work-based learning, industry credentials, and comprehensive career advising. The Biden-Harris Administration is going to keep on fighting to provide every student in every community with career-connected learning."" The grant is part of the Department’s Raise the Bar: Unlocking Career Success initiative, aimed at helping young Americans access good-paying jobs created by President Biden’s Investing in America through seeding and scaling promising models of innovation. Secretary Cardona will highlight this announcement during a visit to the DC Office of the State Superintendent of Education’s (OSSE’s) Advanced Technical Center in Washington, DC today. The CCHS grant program is the first in the Department’s history intended to build capacity and coordination among secondary and postsecondary education, workforce development systems, and other community partners to expand access to career-connected high school programs for more students, with a focus on increasing access to high-quality pathways for underserved students. The Department received more than 160 eligible applications from 43 states and the District of Columbia, requesting more than $850 million to implement comprehensive career-connected learning projects.

22-Jan-24,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-releases-2024-national-educational-technology-plan,U.S. Department of Education Releases 2024 National Educational Technology Plan,"The U.S. Department of Education (Department) today released the 2024 National Educational Technology Plan (NETP): A Call to Action for Closing the Digital Access, Design and Use Divides. First released in fulfillment of the Improving America’s Schools Act of 1994, NETP has been updated multiple times since its original release, most recently in 2016. “From the American Rescue Plan to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and more, the Biden-Harris Administration has made bold investments aimed at closing the digital divide and ensuring all students can equitably access the latest digital tools and technology,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “As we work to Raise the Bar in education, it’s essential we focus on empowering teachers to become designers of active learning, using technology in effective ways to engage and inspire students. The 2024 National Educational Technology Plan is a forward-thinking approach to reframing and realizing the potential of educational technology to enhance the instructional core, reduce achievement gaps, and improve student learning in our schools. While past NETPs have largely served as surveys of the state of the field, the Department’s 2024 NETP frames three key divides limiting the transformational potential of educational technology to support teaching and learning, including: The Digital Use Divide , addressing opportunities to improve how students use technology to enhance their learning, including dynamic applications of technology to explore, create, and engage in critical analysis of academic content and knowledge; The Digital Design Divide , addressing opportunities for educators to expand their professional learning and build the capacities necessary to design learning experiences enabled by technology; and The Digital Access Divide , addressing opportunities for students and educators to gain equitable access to educational technology, including connectivity, devices, and digital content. This also includes accessibility and digital health, safety, and citizenship as key elements of digital access. The 2024 NETP maps each of the three divides to the “instructional core” (i.e., students, teachers, content) and focuses on how schools, districts, and states can use educational technology to help design learning experiences that improve student access to educational opportunities and their outcomes. The NETP provides action-oriented recommendations for states, districts, and school leaders alongside examples from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and several Territories for addressing disparities in educational technology and closing the three divides. To complement the 2024 NETP, the Department will also release guidance today that aims to increase understanding of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act’s requirements regarding assistive technology (AT) devices and services for children with disabilities. The Department will also release a collection of federal resources to support students’ digital health, safety, and citizenship.

19-Jan-24,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-announces-additional-49-billion-approved-student-debt-relief,Biden-Harris Administration Announces Additional $4.9 Billion in Approved Student Debt Relief,"The Biden-Harris Administration announced today the approval of $4.9 billion in additional student loan debt relief for 73,600 borrowers. These discharges are the result of fixes made by the Administration to income-driven repayment (IDR) forgiveness and Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF). Today’s announcement brings the total loan forgiveness approved by the Biden-Harris Administration to $136.6 billion for more than 3.7 million Americans. “The Biden-Harris Administration has worked relentlessly to fix our country's broken student loan system and address the needless hurdles and administrative inaccuracies that, in the past, kept borrowers from getting the student debt forgiveness they deserved,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""The nearly $5 billion in additional debt relief announced today will go to teachers, social workers, and other public servants whose service to our communities have earned them Public Service Loan Forgiveness, as well as borrowers qualifying for income-driven repayment forgiveness because their payments are for the first time being accurately accounted for. Thanks to President Biden's leadership, we're approving this loan forgiveness while moving full speed ahead in our efforts to deliver even greater debt relief, and help more borrowers get on a faster track to loan forgiveness under our new, affordable SAVE repayment plan."" The debt relief announced today is broken down into the following categories: $1.7 billion for 29,700 borrowers through administrative adjustments to IDR payment counts that have brought borrowers closer to forgiveness and address longstanding concerns with the misuse of forbearance by loan servicers. Including today’s announcement, the Biden-Harris Administration has now approved $45.7 billion in IDR relief for 930,500 borrowers. $3.2 billion for 43,900 borrowers through PSLF. This includes borrowers who have benefitted from the Biden-Harris Administration’s limited PSLF waiver as well as regulatory improvements made to the program by the Administration. Total relief through PSLF is now $56.7 billion for 793,400 borrowers since October 2021. Prior to the Biden-Harris Administration’s fixes to PSLF, only about 7,000 borrowers had ever received forgiveness. “Today we are helping borrowers who were promised help with their loans, planned their lives around those promises, and earned forgiveness through years of payments.” said U.S. Under Secretary of Education James Kvaal. “The Biden-Harris Administration is not going to stop until we’ve helped all of those harmed by the broken student loan system.” Continued debt relief for borrowers The Biden-Harris Administration last week announced that the U.S. Department of Education (Department) is fast-tracking additional loan forgiveness through early implementation of the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) Plan. Borrowers who originally took out $12,000 or less for college and are enrolled in the SAVE Plan will see forgiveness after as few as 10 years of payments. Those who are enrolled in SAVE and are eligible for early forgiveness will have their debts automatically cancelled starting next month, months ahead of schedule, with no action needed. The Department began communications with borrowers who may be eligible but are not already enrolled in SAVE to encourage them to sign up. The Department is also working with its partners through the SAVE on Student Debt campaign to reach eligible borrowers and provide resources to sign up for SAVE. Borrowers can find additional resources at StudentAid.gov and sign up for the SAVE plan at StudentAid.gov/save . An unparalleled track record of borrower assistance The Biden-Harris Administration has taken historic steps to reduce the burden of student debt and ensure that student loans are not a barrier to opportunity for students and families. The Administration secured the largest increase to Pell Grants in a decade and finalized new rules to protect borrowers from career programs that leave graduates with unaffordable debts or insufficient earnings. And, in the wake of the Supreme Court decision on the Administration's original student debt relief plan, the Administration continues its work to pursue an alternative path to debt relief through negotiated rulemaking under the Higher Education Act. Beyond the relief under IDR and PSLF, the Biden-Harris Administration has also approved: $11.7 billion for almost 513,000 borrowers with a total and permanent disability. $22.5 billion for more than 1.3 million borrowers who were cheated by their schools, saw their institutions precipitously close, or are covered by related court settlements."
11-Jan-24,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-shorten-path-debt-cancellation-some-save-borrowers,Biden-Harris Administration to Shorten Path to Debt Cancellation for Some SAVE Borrowers,"New data show 6.9 million borrowers are enrolled in the Administration’s most affordable repayment plan Today, the Biden-Harris Administration announced that next month it will start providing forgiveness after as few as 10 years of payments for borrowers on the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) Plan who originally took out $12,000 or less for college. Borrowers enrolled in SAVE who are eligible for early forgiveness will have their debts cancelled immediately starting next month, with no action on their part. To help as many borrowers as possible benefit from this action, the (Department) is kicking off an outreach and email campaign to encourage borrowers who are not currently enrolled in SAVE to sign up because they may benefit from this shortened repayment period. The Administration is also announcing today that there are now 6.9 million borrowers enrolled in the SAVE Plan as of early January, more than double the enrollment on the Revised Pay As You Earn (REPAYE) plan it replaced in August. The shorter time to forgiveness benefit will particularly help borrowers who attended community colleges; these students typically borrow smaller amounts. Overall, the Department estimates that the SAVE Plan will make 85% of future community college borrowers debt free within 10 years. The SAVE Plan will also help borrowers who are more likely to struggle with their loans, as most borrowers in default originally borrowed $12,000 or less. “Beyond being the most affordable student loan repayment plan ever available, the Biden-Harris Administration designed the SAVE Plan to put community college students and other low-balance borrowers on a faster track to debt forgiveness than ever before,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “Our ability to deliver this relief to borrowers months ahead of schedule is a testament to the Biden Administration’s commitment to delivering relief to as many borrowers as possible, as quickly as possible. Today’s announcement gives borrowers an even greater reason to check out the SAVE plan and find out if they may qualify for earlier debt relief. With lower monthly payments, protection from runaway interest, and faster timelines to debt forgiveness, President Biden’s SAVE plan is not only benefitting millions of current borrowers but also providing the students of today and tomorrow with a more affordable pathway to college degrees and credentials.” The Department is accelerating this benefit months ahead of the date previously laid out in the Biden-Harris Administration’s final regulations for implementing the SAVE plan, which is July 1, 2024. Borrowers enrolled in SAVE who have made at least 10 years of monthly payments and originally took out $12,000 or less for undergraduate or graduate postsecondary studies are eligible for forgiveness. For every $1,000 borrowed above $12,000, a borrower can receive forgiveness after an additional year of payments. That means a borrower who originally borrowed less than $21,000 will be eligible for forgiveness faster than the 20-year timeline for undergraduate borrowers on SAVE. The benefit is based upon the original principal balance of all federal loans borrowed to attend school, not what a borrower currently owes or the amount of an individual loan. Periods that count toward the forgiveness benefits include months during the payment pause and time in repayment as determined through the payment count adjustment. “Today’s announcement will help struggling borrowers who have been making loan payments for years, including many who never graduated from college,” said Under Secretary James Kvaal. “Giving borrowers with smaller loans a faster path to being debt free will help many borrowers avoid financial distress and have peace of mind.” The Biden-Harris Administration is also kicking off a wave of outreach to encourage more borrowers to enroll in SAVE, particularly those who may be able eligible for immediate forgiveness. Today, the Department will begin emailing borrowers whose balances and time in repayment indicates they may benefit from the shortened time to forgiveness provision. The Department will also work with the SAVE on Student Debt coalition and other supportive organizations to conduct further outreach in the coming months. In February, the Department will start notifying borrowers on SAVE who are eligible for forgiveness that their loans are being discharged automatically with no action needed on the borrower’s part. The Department will also email borrowers not on SAVE who can receive forgiveness as soon as they sign up for the plan. Moving forward, the Department will continue to identify and discharge the loans of eligible borrowers on a regular basis. The Department strongly encourages all eligible borrowers who originally borrowed $12,000 or less to apply for SAVE as soon as possible. For student borrowers, the SAVE Plan remains the most affordable repayment option in most cases. Under the SAVE Plan, single borrowers who earn less than $32,800 per year or those in a family of four making less than $67,500 have a $0 payment. The SAVE Plan also ensures that a borrower’s balance will never grow due to unpaid interest as long as they are making their monthly payments. The improved application allows borrowers to have their income securely accessed through the Internal Revenue Service so they do not need to re-certify their income or reapply for plans like SAVE each year. Savings for borrowers will increase again when the Department implements further payment reductions for borrowers with undergraduate loans in July 2024. Continued Increases in SAVE Enrollment The Biden-Harris Administration also announced today that there are now 6.9 million borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan. This includes 2.8 million borrowers on SAVE who are new to an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan and approximately 700,000 who have switched from another income-driven repayment plan. Overall, borrowers are repaying $374 billion in federal student loans on the plan, about 30% of all Direct Loans dollars in repayment, deferment, or forbearance. Borrowers are continuing to see significant financial benefits from being on SAVE compared to the previous REPAYE Plan. Of SAVE enrollees, 3.9 million have a $0 payment, while borrowers who owe a payment are saving an estimated $117 a month (just over $1,400 a year). These savings don’t include the interest that borrowers avoid each month after they satisfy their repayment obligation. Department data show that SAVE enrollment continues to be well targeted, as 75% of SAVE borrowers also received Pell Grants, which are awarded to low-income college students. The SAVE Plan builds on the Biden-Harris Administration’s work to reduce the burden of student debt on America’s families. The Biden-Harris Administration has already approved nearly $132 billion in targeted relief for more than 3.6 million borrowers. Just last month, the Department announced the approval of an additional $4.8 billion in student loan debt relief for 80,300 borrowers. The Biden-Harris Administration has now approved: Almost $44 billion in IDR relief for nearly 901,000 borrowers; $53.5 billion for almost 750,000 borrowers through fixes to Public Service Loan Forgiveness that began in October 2021. By contrast, only about 7,000 borrowers had received forgiveness through these programs at the start of the Biden-Harris Administration. The Biden-Harris Administration is currently in the process of writing proposed regulations that would make more borrowers eligible for debt relief. It also recently finalized regulations that help create the most effective accountability system ever for colleges that leave students with unaffordable debts and will continue to take action to reduce the cost of college and improve the value of postsecondary education.

The funding is being awarded to seven school districts across the country as part of the Project Prevent grant program. The Vice President will make the announcement in Charlotte, North Carolina, where she will be joined by U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona to highlight the Biden-Harris Administration’s efforts to reduce gun violence and expand access to mental health services for students. “Every child deserves the freedom to live safe from gun violence in their school and throughout their community. President Biden and I are committed to protecting this freedom and continuing to address an epidemic of gun violence that has become the leading cause of death for children across America,” said Vice President Harris. “With today’s announcement, we are reaffirming our Administration’s dedication to preventing this senseless violence and keeping our children, families, and communities safe. As we call on Congress to pass commonsense gun safety policies, we are proud to fund proven solutions like those supported by Project Prevent that help schools increase access to mental health and other resources for their students.” “The youth mental health crisis and the devastating impact of gun violence on our communities have been mounting for years, but thanks to President Biden’s leadership, we are making historic investments that will reshape how our schools care for students and provide the safe learning environments they need to grow and succeed,” said Secretary Cardona. “Today’s announcement of another $6.4 million in Project Prevent funding complements the Biden-Harris Administration’s unprecedented $2 billion investment secured through the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act to transform school-based mental health and create safer and more positive school climates. These investments mean that schools and communities will have more resources for the interventions that help keep students safe and healthy. The fact is, we cannot recover academically and Raise the Bar for education in this country unless we meet the needs of the whole child, and that starts with creating safe, welcoming schools where teaching and learning can truly thrive.” Project Prevent grants help build the capacity of local educational agencies (LEAs) that have been impacted by community violence to expand their capacity to implement community- and school-based strategies to prevent and mitigate the impacts of community violence, and to address the impacts of exposure to community violence. For fiscal year 2024, seven new grants, totaling approximately $6.4 million, will focus on building connections between schools and community-based organizations to provide students with the resources to help break cycles of violence and trauma, including through the use of mental health services and supports. These awards will allow school districts to identify and serve students exposed to community violence by helping them increase student access to mental health services, support conflict management programs, and implement other community- and school-based strategies to help prevent community violence and to mitigate the impacts of exposure to community violence. This announcement is the latest step that the Biden-Harris Administration has taken as part of its ongoing commitment to prevent and reduce the impact that community violence has in many of our country’s school communities. These grants also support the Administration’s goal of transforming how we address mental health in America, which is a core pillar in the Biden-Harris Administration’s Unity Agenda for our nation. The historic Bipartisan Safer Communities Act has delivered unprecedented resources to support youth mental health, including for students impacted by gun violence.

10-Jan-24,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-educations-office-civil-rights-announces-resolution-sexual-harassment-investigation-san-francisco-conservatory-music,U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights Announces Resolution of Sexual Harassment Investigation of San Francisco Conservatory of Music,"The U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) today announced that the San Francisco Conservatory of Music has entered into a resolution agreement to ensure its compliance with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, when responding to allegations of student-to-student sexual harassment, including sexual assault and stalking. OCR investigated whether the Conservatory responded consistent with Title IX to a student’s complaint that another student had sexually assaulted her twice and then stalked her in 2022. OCR determined that the Conservatory’s defective response violated Title IX at every stage of investigation and resolution. First, the Conservatory did not provide the student with reasonable, individualized supportive measures designed to preserve her equal access to its education programs. As a result, the student lost access to certain classes, tutorials and performances that were part of her education program during the pendency of the Conservatory’s investigation. Then, in the investigation phase, the Conservatory failed to provide both the student and the respondent written notice of its Title IX grievance process and the alleged misconduct that the Conservatory investigated, failed to offer both parties the opportunity to review relevant evidence in the investigative report at least 10 days prior to its completion, failed to ensure the report included all that the Title IX regulations require, and failed to hold a live hearing. At the determination stage, the Conservatory failed to identify the investigated allegations, to make a determination regarding each alleged assault and the stalking, and to notify the student of her right to appeal the sexual assault determination. At the resolution stage, OCR found the Conservatory’s responses to the student’s multiple reports that the respondent had violated the active avoidance order and stalked her to be clearly unreasonable in light of known circumstances. OCR also determined that the Conservatory’s Title IX grievance procedures themselves did not comply with the Department’s Title IX regulations, and that the Conservatory did not fulfill its Title IX recordkeeping obligations. The resolution agreement reached today commits the Conservatory to take steps needed to ensure nondiscrimination on the basis of sex in all of its education programs and activities. “This resolution agreement with the San Francisco Conservatory of Music addresses its multiple failures to respond to alleged sexual assault and stalking as Title IX requires,” said Catherine E. Lhamon, Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights. “Today’s agreement commits the Conservatory to comply with Title IX to protect all its students in the future.” The Conservatory’s commitments in the resolution agreement include the following: Reviewing and revising its Title IX policies, grievance procedures, and Notice of Nondiscrimination to comply with the Title IX regulations. Training and issuing a guidance memorandum to its Title IX Coordinator and all staff members responsible for responding to and investigating reports of sexual harassment. Providing OCR with information about all complaints of sexual harassment, including sexual assault and stalking, to the Conservatory in the 2021-2022, 2022-2023, and 2023-2024 academic years, including how it responded. Taking steps to protect the student on the Conservatory’s campus or on property under the Conservatory’s control, including classrooms, performance spaces, and dorms. Offering to reimburse the student for health-related costs to address the effects of the Conservatory’s noncompliant response to her allegations of sexual harassment. Providing the student and the respondent with a copy of the investigative report. And, Providing the student with the opportunity to retake at no cost any class in which her grade was negatively affected as a result of the Conservatory’s deliberately indifferent response to her reports of alleged sexual assault, stalking, and violations of the order. The resolution letter and resolution agreement are available on the Office for Civil Rights website ."
8-Jan-24,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-announces-over-1-million-2024-2025-fafsa-forms-successfully-submitted-and-form-now-available-247-students-and-families,U.S. Department of Education Announces Over 1 Million 2024-2025 FAFSA Forms Successfully Submitted and Form Now Available 24/7 for Students and Families,"The U.S. Department of Education (Department) today announced that it has received over one million applications from students using the redesigned 2024–25 Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA®) form and that the form is now available for students and families to access 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Students and their families can use the 2024–25 FAFSA form to apply for federal financial aid to attend college between July 1, 2024, and June 30, 2025. “Over one million students and families and counting have successfully filled out the ‘Better FAFSA,’ which is now available 24 hours a day, seven days a week,” said U.S. Secretary of Miguel Cardona. “The fact that over a million students were able to complete the Better FAFSA during its brief soft launch period underscores our commitment to making applying for college financial aid simpler and easier than ever before. With the Better FAFSA now live 24/7, we are moving the federal financial aid application into the 21st century and in the process, putting affordable higher education within the reach of 610,000 students from families with low incomes who will now be eligible for Pell Grants for the very first time.” The Department began the soft launch of the 2024–25 FAFSA form on December 30, 2023, when the form was available to students and families periodically while the Department monitored website performance and form functionality in real time. The Department initiated pauses for site maintenance and to make technical updates as needed to provide a better experience for students and their families. Now, the form will be continuously available except for routine maintenance, typical of any FAFSA cycle. ""We have heard from students and families that the new FAFSA form is a better experience that’s easier to complete,” said Federal Student Aid Chief Richard Cordray. “We recognize how important it is for students and families to get the information they need on StudentAid.gov to plan for the upcoming school year. We will continue to communicate directly with students, families, and schools about how they can access the maximum support available to them to pursue their higher education dreams.” Expanded Aid Eligibility and Streamlined Experience The significant improvements to the 2024–25 FAFSA form expand eligibility for federal student aid, helping an estimated 610,000 more students get Federal Pell Grants. Recipients will receive more aid, with nearly 1.5 million additional students receiving the maximum Pell Grant award. The new FAFSA form also provides a streamlined user experience for students and their families. Millions of students and families will benefit from the Department’s effort to streamline the FAFSA experience, so applicants only see relevant questions based on the answers they provide. For example, applicants will be able to skip as many as 26 questions, depending on their individual circumstances. While the form is expected to take around an hour on average for applicants, some applicants could answer as few as 18 questions in less than 10 minutes. The 2024–25 FAFSA form also notably includes the ability to securely retrieve tax information directly from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), improving the user experience and reducing time to complete. Students and their contributors (e.g., parents and spouses) must provide consent and approval to have their federal tax information transferred directly into the 2024–25 FAFSA form via a secure, direct data exchange with the IRS. This greatly simplifies the process of accessing tax information for as many as 4 million additional students and families, particularly for families with low incomes who are not required to file tax returns to confirm such status. These updates are part of the Department’s implementation of the bipartisan FUTURE Act and FAFSA Simplification Act . The Biden-Harris Administration remains committed to delivering a better FAFSA form and experience accessing federal student aid for students and families."
5-Jan-24,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-takes-additional-action-hold-student-loan-servicers-accountable-failing-meet-contractual-obligations,Biden-Harris Administration Takes Additional Action to Hold Student Loan Servicers Accountable for Failing to Meet Contractual Obligations,"The Biden-Harris Administration today announced it is withholding payments to three student loan servicers as part of the U.S. Department of Education’s (Department) continued efforts to strengthen protections for student loan borrowers and hold servicers accountable. The Department has found that Aidvantage, EdFinancial, and Nelnet all failed to meet contractual obligations to send timely billing statements to a combined total of 758,000 borrowers for the first month of repayment. As a result of identifying these errors, the Department is withholding payment of $2 million from Aidvantage, $161,000 from EdFinancial, and $13,000 from Nelnet - amounts based upon the number of borrowers impacted by these errors. “Today’s actions make clear that the Biden-Harris Administration will not give student loan servicers a free pass for poor performance and missteps that jeopardize borrowers,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “As millions of Americans return to repayment, the Department of Education will continue to engage in aggressive oversight of student loan servicers and put the interests of borrowers first. When unacceptable errors are uncovered, servicers should expect to be held accountable and borrowers should count on this administration to hold them harmless.” To remedy the impact of these errors on borrowers, the Department directed each servicer to place affected borrowers into administrative forbearance until the issues were resolved. While their loans are in administrative forbearance, borrowers will not owe payments and any accrued interest will be adjusted to zero. Additionally, any months that borrowers spend in administrative forbearance will count as progress toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness or income-driven repayment forgiveness. The Department’s action will ensure that borrowers are not harmed by these servicer errors and that servicers are held accountable for their actions. The Department previously withheld $7.2 million from MOHELA for sending late or no billing statements to 2.5 million borrowers. “We will not allow servicers to cause harm to borrowers as they resume making their monthly payments,” Federal Student Aid Chief Operating Officer Rich Cordray said. “We are committed to providing a seamless repayment experience for borrowers. We will continue our strong oversight and efforts to hold servicers to their contractual obligations and make sure borrowers are not harmed by these errors.” The Department will continue its stringent oversight of servicers through our accountability framework and takes this responsibility very seriously. These actions show that the oversight has been effective in discovering mistakes when they happen, allowing the Department to take corrective action where needed. The Department will continue to monitor servicer performance and ensure they are meeting their contractual obligations to the Department and providing accurate and timely service to borrowers. If a servicer fails to meet these obligations, additional action may be warranted by the Department. In addition, in an attempt to make sure borrowers are not penalized for late or missed payments during the transition to repayment, the Department recently sent a letter to credit reporting agencies and credit scoring companies reminding them that borrowers’ current payment behavior is not necessarily indicative of an inability or unwillingness to make payments."
4-Jan-24,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-announces-47-million-new-funding-support-school-infrastructure-investments,Biden-Harris Administration Announces $47 Million in New Funding to Support School Infrastructure Investments,"The Biden-Harris Administration announced eight new grant awards today totaling more than $37 million over five years under the Supporting America’s School Infrastructure (SASI) program and one new grant for $10 million over five years under the National Center on School Infrastructure (NCSI) program. This $47 million investment, issued by the U.S. Department of Education (Department), bolsters the capacity of states to support school districts in improving school facilities with the goal of more equitable access to healthy, sustainable, and modern learning environments for all students. U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona will highlight this announcement during a visit to Virginia today with Ranking Member of the House Education and Workforce Committee, U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott, and U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, a member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. “These new investments in modern, healthy, and sustainable school infrastructure reflect the Biden-Harris Administration's commitment to both promoting student success and protecting our planet for generations to come,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “Research has shown that modern, well-maintained facilities and healthy learning environments can help schools Raise the Bar by increasing student achievement, reducing absenteeism, and improving teacher retention. At the Department of Education, we're going to keep fighting to provide every student in every community with access to safe and healthy 21st-century schools that inspire learning, unleash imagination, and motivate children and youth to bring their best each day."" “Chronic neglect of America’s public schools has forced students and teachers across the country to learn and work in outdated and hazardous school buildings. Moreover, dilapidated and poorly ventilated school facilities pose significant health threats that make it harder for teachers to teach and students to learn,"" said Rep. Robert C. “Bobby” Scott (VA-03). “These new investments announced by the Education Department will help increase school districts capacity to improve school infrastructure. It is far past time to improve public education infrastructure."" The SASI program is the first in the Department’s history intended to increase state capacity to support underserved school districts to improve their school facilities. States receiving SASI funds will be able to conduct school facility needs assessments in high-need school districts; hire new staff; and develop or improve public school infrastructure data systems, among other actions. The NCSI program will establish a national clearinghouse and technical assistance center that will consolidate federal resources related to public school infrastructure improvements that support safe, healthy, sustainable, and equitable public school facilities. NCSI will also provide targeted technical assistance to SASI grantees to expand state expertise in school infrastructure. Additionally, today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) is releasing new information on how school districts can file for tax credits for clean energy infrastructure through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The IRA provides for the largest investment in clean energy in U.S. history and has created a unique opportunity for K-12 school districts under provisions for direct pay. The NCSI will provide technical assistance to states and districts on federal opportunities that support school infrastructure, including these new tax credits. The Department works closely across the Biden-Harris Administration to lead school infrastructure efforts, including through an Infrastructure and Sustainability initiative , which includes the U.S. Department of Education Green Ribbon Schools recognition award, private sector school infrastructure and sustainability commitments, an annual Green Strides Tour , monthly Infrastructure and Sustainability News , as well as other public engagement on these topics. The Department also partners with federal agencies such as Treasury, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and others to provide resources, funds, and tax incentives that enhance equitable access to healthy, safe, sustainable, and modern school facilities. For example, the DOE now administers the Renew America’s Schools program focused on energy improvements at public school facilities. In addition, its Efficient and Healthy Schools Program leverages DOE labs’ technical expertise to benefit schools and offers recognition for their efforts. The Energy CLASS Prize builds capacity within districts to identify and implement energy and health improvements. There are currently numerous air quality initiatives at the EPA, including a significant investment in clean school buses , including both grants and rebates, with another $500 million round of rebates open until Jan. 31, and water quality programs such as the Voluntary School and Childcare Lead Testing and Reduction Grant .

Today, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) released six issue papers across a range of categories to further these goals, which will be discussed during the first meeting of the Institutional Quality and Program Integrity Committee, meeting January 8-11. The issue papers include proposals to ensure that accrediting agencies and state authorizing agencies -- key pillars of program integrity, along with the federal government -- are appropriately holding institutions accountable for providing high-quality educational opportunities. They also include proposals to create more consumer-friendly policies to ensure students have access to their aid to help cover college costs and receive fair treatment across aid programs. Finally, the proposals include expanding eligibility to TRIO programs to help serve disadvantaged student populations. “The Biden-Harris Administration remains committed to ensuring that higher education institutions and programs are held accountable for delivering on their promise of a better future for students and our financial aid programs are helping students accomplish their goals,” said U.S. Under Secretary of Education James Kvaal. “These efforts are another step in improving the higher education system and ensuring colleges are providing all students with high-quality opportunities for upward social and economic mobility.” The topics on the agenda for the first meeting of the Institutional Quality and Program Integrity Committee include: Cash Management rules which govern the procedures institutions must follow for issuing and managing Title IV aid. Proposals seek to create more student-friendly policies to ensure students receive the aid to which they are entitled. Return of Title IV Funds rules which outline the process institutions must conduct when a student ceases attendance during a payment period or period of enrollment. Proposals would prevent balances from becoming immediately due and streamline and simplify the process for institutions. Accreditation rules which guide the process the Department uses to recognize accrediting agencies, the independent private non-profit and state entities responsible for overseeing the quality of education provided by institutions and programs. Through its proposals, the Department seeks to implement a system of risk-based review, increase the rigor of accreditation, and support accreditation as a critical pillar of the program integrity triad. State Authorization rules which govern the requirements for an institution to be considered legally authorized by the state in which it operates, a requirement for Title IV eligibility. Proposals and questions for discussion seek to address the requirements for state approval and licensure, as well as state authorization reciprocity agreements, to ensure adequate oversight of institutions. Distance Education rules which govern the offering of distance education. Proposals under consideration would enable the Department to get better data and compare outcomes for students enrolled online, and to better protect students in the event of college closures. Proposals also seek to strengthen the Department’s ability to oversee distance education programs overall. TRIO rules which govern eligibility of the Federal TRIO programs that provide services to individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds. The proposal would expand participations to more students from disadvantaged backgrounds. The committee will be comprised of non-federal negotiators from 15 constituency groups. A subcommittee focused on TRIO programs will meet on January 12 and include five impacted constituency groups. Through the negotiated rulemaking process, the Department will hear input on the proposals and discussion topics put forward from the non-federal negotiators and hear from members of the public at the end of each day. Through this process, the Department will continue to refine and develop its proposals for consideration. The committee will meet again in February and March, and the subcommittee will meet again in February. The Department is also releasing a list of the individuals who will serve on the negotiating committee and subcommittee, which can be found here . Additional information and updates on the rulemaking process will be posted here . Members of the public who wish to register to view the sessions or provide public testimony can find that information beneath the Program Integrity and Institutional Quality and TRIO Subcommittee headings by clicking on Session 1: January 8 - 11, 2024 and then Materials . Today’s announcement builds on the Biden-Harris Administration’s ambitious efforts to protect students and taxpayers, hold colleges accountable, and ensure that all students can afford to get the education and skills they need after high school. The issue papers and committee meetings are part of a process known as “negotiated rulemaking,” which is required under the H igher Education Act of 1965 , as amended, for any regulations related to the Federal student financial aid programs."
22-Dec-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-awards-445-million-improve-postsecondary-education-access-and-completion-students-rural-communities,Biden-Harris Administration Awards $44.5 Million to Improve Postsecondary Education Access and Completion for Students in Rural Communities,"The Biden-Harris Administration today announced $44.5 million in grants to 22 institutions of higher education to improve rates of postsecondary education enrollment, persistence, and completion among students in rural communities. The Rural Postsecondary and Economic Development (RPED) grant program promotes the development of high-quality career pathways aligned to high-skill, high-wage, and in-demand industry sectors and occupations in the region. In America's rural communities, only 29% of individuals between the ages of 18 and 24 are enrolled in higher education, compared to almost 48% of their counterparts in urban areas and 42% in suburban areas. In addition to navigating how to pay for college and the application process, students in rural areas face other barriers in accessing and completing college, including reliable transportation, food and housing insecurity, and access to health care and high-speed internet. ""The grants announced today by the Biden-Harris administration reflect our commitment to empowering rural communities to build on their strengths, attract new investments, and prepare students for the high-skill, high-wage jobs of tomorrow,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""When we invest in postsecondary attainment in rural communities, we create pathways for students to find rewarding careers that do not require them to leave their hometowns for economic opportunity. These grant awards will help rural institutions Raise the Bar for student success and the attainment of valuable degrees and credentials that lead to brighter futures and greater prosperity."" Today's announcement builds on the Biden-Harris Administration and the U.S. Department of Education's (Department) commitment to students in rural America to have access to career pathways and higher education opportunities that lead to good-paying jobs right in their own communities. This funding also supports the Department's efforts to strengthen the process for students to transition from two-year to four-year institutions.

12-Dec-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/statement-us-secretary-education-miguel-cardona-recent-integrated-postsecondary-education-data-system-collection,Statement from U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona on the Recent Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System Collection,"The National Center for Education Statistics today released the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) . IPEDS gathers information annually from U.S. college, university, and technical and vocational institutions eligible to participate in any of the Title IV federal student financial aid programs. Below is a statement from U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona on the results: ""The Biden-Harris Administration welcomes this latest data from the National Center for Education Statistics, which, for the first time, include institutions' use of legacy in college admissions across our country. Access to data on legacy applicants is essential for colleges and universities reevaluating their admissions practices and working to build diverse student bodies in the wake of the Supreme Court's disappointing ruling on affirmative action earlier this year. The U.S. Department of Education has issued a comprehensive report on the most effective and lawful strategies for promoting equal opportunity and diversity on our college campuses, and we will continue to support efforts to promote equity in higher education. This data also shows that unfortunately still far too many students never make it to commencement day and that institutions must do more to raise the bar for student success and equitable outcomes. For the United States to thrive and compete in the 21 st century, we need a higher education system that provides students of all backgrounds with opportunities to reach their potential, cultivate their talents, and contribute to our country."""

The grants are being provided under the Research and Development Infrastructure (RDI) program and the Postsecondary Student Success Grant (PSSG) program. The RDI program provides funds to HBCUs, TCCUs, and MSIs to transform their research infrastructure, including strengthening research productivity, faculty expertise, physical infrastructure, and partnerships leading to increases in external funding. The PSSG program aims to equitably improve postsecondary student outcomes, including retention, transfer, credit accumulation, and completion, by leveraging data and implementing, scaling, and rigorously evaluating evidence-based approaches. This funding builds on the more than $25 billion in funding to HBCUs, MSIs, and TCCUs through the Department since President Biden took office. Specifically, $7.3 billion in cumulative investments in HBCUs, $474.5 million for TCCUs, and $18.1 billion for MSIs. “The Biden-Harris Administration recognizes the urgency of this moment in higher education and that creating opportunities for students of color and other underserved students to succeed in today’s most cutting-edge fields has never mattered more,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “These grant awards will help many of our nation’s most inclusive and diverse colleges and universities expand their capacity to drive research and innovation, and propel more students to graduation day and fulfilling careers. This is how we Raise the Bar for college excellence and attainment in this country and close equity gaps in higher education that have no place in the 21st century.” RDI program grants are being awarded to five HBCUs, two TCCUs, three Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs), and a dual HSI and Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institution (AANAPISI). For HBCUs and MSIs, the grant will support institutions in increasing their level of research activity in alignment with the Carnegie Classification designations to move from the Doctoral and Professional Universities (D/PU) classification toward the Doctoral Universities with High Research Activity (R2) classification. It also will increase their classification from the Doctoral Universities with High Research Activity (R2) toward the Doctoral Universities with Very High Research Activity (R1) category. For TCCUs, the funds will support an increase in research activities, undergraduate research opportunities, faculty development, research development, and infrastructure, including physical infrastructure and human capital development. Because of their central role in educating underserved students, including students of color, it is important for HBCUs, TCCUs, and MSIs to excel in research activity that can impact funding, faculty and student recruitment, student research opportunities, and promote diversity in graduate students and faculty at an institution. Nine institutions are receiving grants through PSSG to fund evidence-based strategies that result in improved outcomes for underserved students. The funding is being awarded to six grantees that are in the early phase and three grantees in the mid-phase/expansion phase, based upon the amount of existing research validating their effectiveness in improving student postsecondary education outcomes.

6-Dec-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-announces-nearly-5-billion-additional-student-debt-relief,Biden-Harris Administration Announces Nearly $5 Billion in Additional Student Debt Relief,"The Biden-Harris Administration announced today the approval of an additional $4.8 billion in student loan debt relief for 80,300 borrowers. These discharges stem from fixes made by the U.S. Department of Education to income-driven repayment (IDR) forgiveness and Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF). Today's announcement brings the total approved debt cancellation by the Biden-Harris Administration to nearly $132 billion for more than 3.6 million Americans. “Before President Biden took office, it was virtually impossible for eligible borrowers to access the student debt relief they rightfully earned,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “The data released today once again make clear that the Biden-Harris Administration’s relentless efforts to fix the broken student loan system are paying off in a big way, with more than 3.6 million borrowers now approved for nearly $132 billion in loan forgiveness. This level of debt relief is unparalleled and we have no intention of slowing down.” Today’s debt relief approvals are in two categories: $2.2 billion for nearly 46,000 borrowers through fixes to IDR that will provide borrowers with an accurate count of progress toward forgiveness and address longstanding concerns with misuse of forbearance. Including today’s numbers, the Biden-Harris Administration has now approved almost $44 billion in IDR relief for nearly 901,000 borrowers. $2.6 billion for 34,400 borrowers through PSLF . This includes borrowers who have benefited through the limited PSLF waiver and ongoing regulatory improvements to the programs. This brings total relief through PSLF up to $53.5 billion for almost 750,000 borrowers since October 2021. By contrast, only about 7,000 borrowers had received forgiveness through these programs at the start of the Biden-Harris Administration. An unparalleled track record of borrower assistance The Biden-Harris Administration has taken historic steps to reduce the burden of student debt and ensure that student loans are not a barrier to opportunity for students and families. The Administration earlier this year launched the most affordable student loan repayment plan – SAVE – which makes many borrowers' monthly payments as low as $0 and prevents balances from growing because of unpaid interest. The Administration secured the largest increase to Pell Grants in a decade and finalized new rules to protect borrowers from career programs that leave graduates with unaffordable debts or insufficient earnings. And, in the wake of the Supreme Court decision on the Administration's original student debt relief plan, the Administration continues its work to pursue an alternative path to debt relief through negotiated rulemaking under the Higher Education Act. Beyond the relief under IDR and PSLF, the Biden-Harris Administration has also approved: $11.7 billion for almost 513,000 borrowers with a total and permanent disability. $22.5 billion for more than 1.3 million borrowers who were cheated by their schools, saw their institutions precipitously close, or are covered by related court settlements.

5-Dec-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-announces-277-million-education-innovation-and-research-grants-help-address-academic-recovery,Biden-Harris Administration Announces $277 Million In Education Innovation and Research Grants to Help Address Academic Recovery,"As part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s ongoing work to address academic recovery, including supporting student success in math and reading, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) today announced $277 million in new grant awards to advance educational equity and innovation through the Education Innovation and Research (EIR) grant program . State-administered test scores from the 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 school years show some early signs of rebounding from the major disruptions of the pandemic, but not enough are back to pre-pandemic levels—and the recovery has been uneven—with the students most impacted still furthest behind. We have a long way to go, especially for communities and students who have been exposed to longstanding inequality. These new grant awards can help us get there with $90.3 million for STEM, $87.2 million for social emotional well-being, including student engagement, and $76.5 million for projects in rural areas. “This $277 million in grant awards from the Biden-Harris Administration will fund some of the nation’s most promising efforts to raise the bar for academic recovery, excellence, and equity in education,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “I am especially excited to have the Department of Education support innovative efforts across the country to enhance literacy, math, and STEM instruction broadly in underserved communities and set the stage for young people to succeed, as well as learn how to address real-world problems in today’s most cutting-edge fields. All of this year’s grantees are pioneering exciting, evidence-based strategies to close opportunity gaps and provide young people with the engaging and impactful learning experiences they deserve so that they can achieve at high levels.” The EIR programs help create, implement, replicate, and expand entrepreneurial, evidence-based innovations to improve outcomes for historically underserved learners and to rigorously evaluate such innovations. The EIR grants have been awarded to 45 grantees to advance educational innovation, research, and develop new solutions to addressing persistent educational opportunity gaps for students who have been historically underserved. These awards are announced as the Department celebrates the one-year anniversary of the YOU Belong in STEM initiative , which supports the implementation and scaling of equitable, high-quality STEM education for all students from PreK to higher education—regardless of background—to prepare them for 21st century career readiness and global competitiveness. “Diversity is the strength of our nation; it fuels innovation and progress. In celebration of the YOU Belong in STEM anniversary, the Department is pleased to support these new EIR grantees that advance our goal to create a more inclusive STEM community, while also supporting student success in math and reading,” said U.S. Deputy Secretary of Education Cindy Marten. “As the Department continues to advance equity and innovation, we invite everyone to join us in celebrating the YOU Belong in STEM anniversary and the positive impact these EIR grantees will have on shaping the future of education.” The 2023 cohort of EIR grantees represents a wide range of innovative approaches that Raise the Bar and advance academic excellence, student engagement, social and emotional development and well-being, and create pathways for global engagement for schools across the nation—including more than $100 million in grants for strategies designed to support success in math and reading. For example: The Concord Consortium’s project will employ a strategy to integrate artificial intelligence (AI) education to expand access to AI programs in math and literacy for students underrepresented in the computing field, including African American and Hispanic students, students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, living in remote rural areas, or in under-resourced schools, as well as develop teachers’ competency for implementing AI in math program. The Education Development Center will launch a project titled “Math for All: Expanding Professional Learning to Improve Mathematics Outcomes for Students in High-Need Schools” to develop the capacity of teacher leaders to make high-quality math instruction accessible to all students. The project will be implemented across Illinois, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, and New York. WestEd through their Mid-phase grant will serve schools throughout the Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Texas, and Utah regions. The project will meet the critical needs for both disciplinary literacy and foundational reading skills in high-need 8th and 9th graders by leveraging two evidence-based interventions—the Apprenticeship for Academic Literacy curriculum and through modernizing texts, streamlining the curriculum, and integrating foundational reading skills. Unbounded Learning, Inc. will launch their Reading Reimagined project to provide professional learning to grades 2-5 teachers. The project covers foundational literacy, language variation and style shifting, lesson plans, and job-embedded coaching to prepare teachers to provide differentiated instruction designed to help students “style shift” to General American English (GAE). This grantee has partnered with the University of California-Irvine and the American Institutes for Research. The North Carolina Department of Public Instruction will focus its PRISM (Patterns for Reaching and Impacting Students in Math) project to improve math outcomes for high-need students through the creation and testing of strategies to enhance the adoption and use of its Patterns framework, a comprehensive professional learning program designed to improve math outcomes, particularly for high-need students. Since day one, and through historic investments like the American Rescue Plan, the Biden-Harris Administration has worked to help every school accelerate academic achievement, open safely for in-person instruction, and build communities where all students feel they belong. Today’s announcement builds on these extensive investments in K-12 schools to accelerate academic success nationwide.

4-Dec-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-prepares-third-student-debt-relief-negotiation-session,Biden-Harris Administration Prepares for Third Student Debt Relief Negotiation Session,"The Biden-Harris Administration today took another step in its continued efforts to provide financial relief to significant numbers of student loan borrowers with the release of an updated copy of proposed regulatory text. The proposals build on the Biden-Harris Administration’s actions to date to provide student loan borrowers with much-needed breathing room. Already the Administration has approved a total of $127 billion in student debt relief for 3.6 million borrowers through a variety of actions. The U.S. Department of Education (Department) will discuss the proposed text released today with its committee of non-Federal negotiators December 11 and 12. This meeting is the next required public step before the Department is able to start working on draft rules, which will be released for public comment next year. In addition, the Department continues to consider relief options for borrowers experiencing financial hardship that the current loan system does not address, and will be dedicating time to this topic in the upcoming negotiating session. “The Biden-Harris Administration has already secured a total of $127 billion in debt relief for 3.6 million borrowers through a variety of actions, but we know there are so many hardworking Americans and families out there who still need help,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “Student loans are supposed to be a bridge to a better life, not a life sentence of endless debt. This rulemaking process is about standing up for borrowers who’ve been failed by the country’s broken student loan system and creating new regulations that will reduce the burden of student debt in this country.” The proposed regulatory text released today provides more information on ideas discussed in early November around separate types of debt relief. The updated text reflects suggestions from negotiators and continued review by the Department. The text proposes to provide relief in the following circumstances: Borrowers whose balances are greater than what they owed upon entering repayment. Many borrowers see interest charges grow faster than they can make payments. The Department has addressed these problems going forward through the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan and new policies limiting interest capitalization. One of the Department’s proposals would provide up to $10,000 of relief to all borrowers who have experienced balance growth due to interest. Multiple proposals would provide even more interest relief to lower-income borrowers and to borrowers enrolled in SAVE. Borrowers whose loans first entered repayment many years ago. The Department updated this proposed text to provide one-time relief 20 years after entering repayment for borrowers with only undergraduate loans. All other borrowers would receive forgiveness on loans that entered repayment 25 years ago, the same timeline as proposed by the Department at the second session. Borrowers who are eligible for forgiveness under income-driven repayment plans or discharge opportunities such as Public Service Loan Forgiveness but have not yet applied for such relief. The proposal would provide borrowers with the benefits they have earned. The Department simplified this language from the prior session. Borrowers who attended programs or institutions that failed to deliver sufficient financial value. This policy would provide relief to borrowers who are left repaying loans where the Department has taken action to terminate future borrowing at an institution or program because the institution or program is leaving students with unaffordable debts, or where such actions are cut off by closure. The Department clarified and expanded this proposed language from the prior session. In addition to including situations where a program or institution failed accountability measures based on their cohort default rates or debt-to-earnings rates, the Department is proposing to include situations where institutions or programs lose access to Federal aid due to actions that financially harm students, such as misconduct affecting student eligibility. This would also apply to programs or institutions that close prior to the finalization of such efforts or determinations. Next week, the Department and the non-Federal negotiators will discuss these ideas. At the end of the two-day session the committee will determine whether it is able to reach consensus on each of these ideas individually. Consensus means there is no dissent on a given idea. Following this meeting the Department will work on draft rules that will be released for public comment next year. The Department will use any regulatory text that reaches consensus in its draft rules. While the Department is not providing proposed regulatory text related to defining hardship for borrowers, the Department will consider ways to pursue relief for this category of borrowers and has dedicated time to address this issue during the December session. A copy of the proposed regulatory text is available here . Updates on the student debt relief rulemaking process will be posted here . This includes transcripts and archived videos of the first and second sessions, which took place in October and November. Members of the public who wish to view the upcoming session or provide public testimony can also find a link on that page where they can register to do so. There will only be public comment on the first day. Continuing to provide debt relief and support borrowers Today’s announcement builds on the work the Biden-Harris Administration has already done to improve the student loan program and make higher education more affordable. This includes approving a total of $127 billion in relief for nearly 3.6 million borrowers, through a variety of actions, including: Nearly $42 billion for almost 855,000 borrowers who are eligible for forgiveness through IDR by fixing historical inaccuracies in the count of payments that qualify toward forgiveness. Almost $51 billion for 715,000 public servants through Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) programs, including the limited PSLF waiver and Temporary Expanded PSLF (TEPSLF). $11.7 billion for almost 513,000 borrowers with a total and permanent disability. $22.5 billion for more than 1.3 million borrowers who were cheated by their schools, saw their institutions precipitously close, or are covered by related court settlements. The Biden-Harris Administration remains committed to making college more affordable and also ensuring student debt is not a roadblock to attaining a college degree or credential and planning for the future. The Administration launched the most affordable student loan repayment plan ever—the SAVE Plan—earlier this year, has made the largest increase to Pell Grants in a decade, and has charted a course to double the maximum Pell Grant and make community college free to enhance college affordability and reduce unnecessary student debt. The Administration is also holding institutions accountable for unaffordable debts and recently issued final regulations that set standards for graduate earnings and debt outcomes for career programs, while enhancing transparency for all programs to give students the information they need to make informed choices."
4-Dec-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/statement-us-secretary-education-miguel-cardona-recent-pisa-data,Statement by U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona on Recent PISA Data,"Today, the results of 2022 Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) were released, which showed the U.S. world ranking improving in science, math, and reading. Below is a statement from U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona on the results: ""Here's the bottom line: At an extremely tough time in education, the United States moved up in the world rankings in reading, math, and science – all three categories PISA measures – while, unfortunately, many other countries saw declines. ""Today's results are further proof that President Biden's bold investments, backed by tireless efforts at the Department of Education to support student success and academic recovery, kept the United States in the game. ""If President Biden hadn't fought for the single largest investment in education in our nation's history – and delivered it in the form of the American Rescue Plan – we'd be in the same boat as other countries, who didn't make those investments, and saw their rankings fall. ""President Biden believes that investing in public education is investing in the nation's future. ""These results also show that we can't be satisfied with the status quo in education. There's much work to be done – and we need all hands on deck to accelerate academic success."" Secretary Cardona recently spoke to reporters about the latest results.

Ebert fills a spot on the Governing Board reserved for a chief state school officer. Her term began Nov. 20, 2023. “I’m pleased to appoint Superintendent Ebert, a distinguished educator and a chief state school officer with years of expertise and experience, to the National Assessment Governing Board,” said Secretary Cardona, “As we work to Raise the Bar for academic excellence at this critical moment in our students’ continued recovery from the pandemic, it’s vital that we have the evidence-based insights and contributions of proven education leaders to guide decision-making, particularly for how we assess students’ academic achievement in our country. I’m grateful to Superintendent Ebert for her service.” The Nation's Report Card , also known as the National Assessment of Educational Progress, or NAEP, is the only nationally representative assessment of student achievement. Over the past year, NAEP has provided critical insights into student learning across subjects and grades during the pandemic. In addition, accompanying survey data has revealed important trends related to chronic absenteeism, literacy, and teacher confidence in getting students back on track. “I’m honored to welcome Superintendent Ebert to the Governing Board and, together, continuing the pressing work of understanding whether, to what degree, and where the nation is making academic gains,” said Lesley Muldoon, executive director of the Governing Board. “The Nation’s Report Card serves as a catalyst for action to improve student achievement, and state chiefs like Ebert inform and drive that vital work.” The nonpartisan 26-member Governing Board was established by Congress to set policy for the Nation’s Report Card. The board decides what grades and subjects to assess, content to include, and achievement levels. It works with the National Center for Education Statistics, which administers NAEP, to release and disseminate results. See the full governing board members list here . The National Assessment Governing Board is an independent, nonpartisan board whose members include governors, state legislators, local and state school officials, educators, business representatives and members of the general public. Congress created the governing board in 1988 to set policy for the National Assessment of Educational Progress. For more information about the governing board, visit www.nagb.gov ."

In a letter sent to local education agencies (LEAs) today by ED, school districts are being encouraged to order tests directly from the federal government to be made available to students, parents, staff, and school communities. “The Biden-Harris Administration remains a committed partner with schools in keeping our students and teachers safe and healthy,” said ED’s Assistant Secretary for Planning, Evaluation, and Policy Development Roberto Rodriguez. ""These self-tests are easy to use and can play an important role in preventing the spread of COVID-19. We encourage schools to make use of these free resources to safeguard students, parents, and staff throughout the 2023-24 school year.” The tests will be made freely available to all traditional and charter LEAs nationwide. School districts may distribute these tests for free to students, staff, parents, and school communities, with the expectation that millions of tests will be sent out in the coming months – allowing schools to stock nurses’ offices, distribute at events, send tests home with students or parents, and more. “Keeping students and teachers safe has been a priority of the Biden-Harris Administration since day one. Making free COVID-19 tests available to schools this year ensures that students and staff can test throughout the winter months,” said HHS’s Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response Dawn O’Connell. “The partnership announced today leverages ASPR’s ongoing test distribution programs to reach school communities through ED’s close relationship to school districts – helping keep communities healthy.” The partnership announced today is part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s efforts to boost COVID-19 testing access across the country – building on test distribution programs that ASPR has led for over two years. Over 1.6 billion COVID-19 tests have been distributed directly to households, schools, long-term care facilities, community health centers, and food banks through these channels – with over four million tests sent out each week, a number that is expected to rise as more school districts take advantage of this program. Additionally, ASPR opened another round of ordering on COVIDTests.gov on November 20, making four more free tests available to households ahead of the holidays. Today’s announcement builds on previous Biden-Harris Administration efforts to increase COVID-19 testing in schools to keep students safe and schools open.

In the notice, the Department requests nominations for non-Federal negotiators and sets dates for negotiation sessions. “The Department is committed to expanding access to opportunity through quality higher education and supporting students to achieve their college dreams,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “Our regulatory efforts reflect our laser-focus on ensuring that students are well served by the higher education institutions they attend and that our federal student aid programs are helping them to attain postsecondary success.” These nominations are the second step in a process known as “negotiated rulemaking,” which is required under the Higher Education Act for any regulations related to the Federal student financial aid programs. This process started with public hearings and a request for public comments conducted by the Department in April 2023. Next, negotiators selected by the Department will meet virtually on January 8-11, February 5-8, and March 4-7 to discuss ideas for regulatory reform. A subcommittee will meet virtually on January 12 and February 9. Sessions will be open to the public and include opportunities for public comment. The Department announced the following issues for negotiation: The Secretary’s recognition of accrediting agencies and related issues; Institutional eligibility, including state authorization; The definition of distance education as it pertains to clock hour programs and reporting for students who enroll primarily online; Return of Title IV of Higher Education Act of 1965 funds; and Cash management to address disbursement of student funds. The Department also announced the creation of a subcommittee to address participant eligibility requirements for the Federal TRIO programs. The final list of topics is narrowed from the topics first announced to be considered in April this year to allow the Department to focus on related and overlapping topics as announced today. The list does not include Third Party Servicers, which the Department may consider for future rulemakings. Additionally, the Department intends to issue updated guidance on Third Party Servicers in early 2024. The Department is soliciting nominations for primary and alternate negotiators to represent the following 15 constituent groups for the main negotiating committee: Civil rights organizations and consumer advocates; Legal assistance organizations; State officials, including State Higher Education Executive Officers, State authorizing agencies, and State regulators of institutions of higher education; State Attorneys General; Students or borrowers, including currently enrolled borrowers, or groups representing them; U.S. military service members, veterans, or groups representing them; Public four-year Institutions of higher education; Public two-year Institutions of higher education; Private nonprofit institutions of higher education; Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal Colleges and Universities, and Minority-serving institutions, including Hispanic-serving institutions (institutions of higher education eligible to receive Federal assistance under title III, parts A and F, and title IV of the HEA); Proprietary institutions of higher education; Institutional accrediting agencies recognized by the Secretary; Programmatic accrediting agencies recognized by the Secretary, to include State agencies recognized for the approval of nurse education; Financial aid administrators; and Business officers from institutions of higher education. The Department is also soliciting nominations for primary negotiators to represent the following five constituent groups for the subcommittee: Institutions of higher education; Public or private agencies or organizations, including community-based organizations with experience meeting the needs of underserved youth; Secondary schools, including local educational agencies with secondary schools; Current or former participants in a Federal TRIO program; State officials, including State Higher Education Officers, State authorizing agencies, and State regulators of higher education. To submit nominations for committee or subcommittee spots, please email negregnominations@ed.gov . Nominations must be received by December 13, 2023. Please find the official copy of the Federal Register Notice here for additional details on requirements for nominees. Today’s announcement builds on the work the Biden-Harris Administration has already done to fix the student loan program by providing $127 billion in relief to 3.6 million borrowers, make higher education more affordable by securing the largest increase in Pell Grants in a decade, and holding institutions accountable for unaffordable debts."
28-Nov-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-announces-updated-resource-support-inclusion-children-disabilities-early-childhood-programs,Biden-Harris Administration Announces Updated Resource to Support the Inclusion of Children with Disabilities in Early Childhood Programs,"The U.S. Department of Education and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (the Departments) today announced the release of an updated joint-policy statement on supporting the inclusion of children with disabilities in early childhood programs. The HHS-ED Policy Statement on the Inclusion of Children with Disabilities in Early Childhood Programs builds upon a statement originally released in 2015 and includes a renewed commitment and urgency, as children with disabilities continue to face barriers accessing and fully participating in inclusive early childhood programs. The statement was updated consistent with a directive to both agencies in President Biden’s Executive Order on Increasing Access to High-Quality Care and Supporting Caregivers . “Our nation’s youngest learners – including those with disabilities – deserve access to high quality early childhood programs that nurture their potential and provide a strong foundation for future success,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “Today, the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services strengthen our shared commitment to break down barriers for young children with disabilities and Raise the Bar for inclusivity in our early childhood programs.” “The responsibility to ensure that young children with disabilities and their families are included in high-quality early childhood programs is a shared one. Government, at all levels, early childhood systems, and schools must work together to provide necessary support to parents with their kids,” said Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra. “Today, Secretary Cardona and I reaffirm the federal government’s commitment to our role in this important work. Together, we can ensure every child with disabilities can participate in high-quality early childhood programs.” Over 61 million adults in the U.S. have a disability, and nearly one out of every six children is estimated to have a developmental delay. The Departments’ shared vision is to build a culture of inclusion for individuals with disabilities beginning at birth, continuing in early childhood programs and schools, and into communities and workplaces. “Inclusion in high-quality, evidence-based early childhood programs sets the stage for continued inclusion through school years and beyond. Setting high expectations for early inclusion paves the way for children with disabilities to reach their goals and to learn, live, and thrive in school and in their communities,” said Assistant Secretary for the U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services Glenna Wright-Gallo. “All children benefit from inclusive early childhood settings that provide enriching learning experiences. It is incumbent upon leaders, at all levels of government, to work together to ensure that children with disabilities and their families are welcomed and supported in all early childhood settings,” said Acting Assistant Secretary of the Administration for Children and Families Jeff Hild. The statement reiterates expectations for inclusive early childhood settings and updates recommendations for state and local agencies that implement Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) programs, Head Start, childcare, home visiting, preschool, and public schools to increase inclusive early learning opportunities for all children. Additionally, the statement includes evidence-based models and exemplars of inclusion and resources for programs and others to support high-quality individualized programming and inclusion of children with disabilities in early childhood programs.

28-Nov-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-announces-nearly-74-million-expand-full-service-community-schools,Biden-Harris Administration Announces Nearly $74 Million to Expand Full-Service Community Schools,"The U.S. Department of Education today announced nearly $74 million in new, five-year Full-Service Community Schools (FSCS) grants to support an additional 30 local educational agencies, nonprofits, and other public or private organizations and institutions of higher education working to expand community schools including by making awards in four new states: Idaho, Missouri, New Hampshire, and Ohio. U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona will highlight this announcement during a FSCS visit to Idaho today. “These new investments support what I’ve heard from parents and families across the country. Additional funding will deepen community partnerships and connect children and families to vital resources that meet their holistic needs. We know that comprehensive, wrap-around approaches—including nutrition assistance; mental health services; early childhood education; and access to high-quality afterschool summer learning, and enrichment programs—all are crucial for accelerating our students’ academic success and their recovery from the pandemic by helping them thrive both inside and outside of school,” said Secretary Cardona. “I am proud that the Biden-Harris Administration is expanding the number of community schools across the country as an evidence-based strategy to Raise the Bar in education and to deliver on our commitment to support students, families, and whole communities.” This investment builds on the Department’s extensive record of supporting academic success, expanding access to mental health and health services, supporting strong family engagement and community partnerships, and helping schools provide students and families with the resources they need to thrive. Research indicates that positive learning environments where students receive key services—including nutritional, dental, vision, and mental health services—are critical for accelerating academic recovery. Students learn better, have increased attendance, and are more engaged in their learning environment when their whole needs are met. The Biden-Harris Administration has expanded Full-Service Community Schools five-fold, from $25 million in 2020 to $150 million in 2023. Community schools collaborate with local non-profits, health providers, private partners, and other agencies to coordinate and deliver services like health care, mental health and nutrition services, afterschool and summer programming, and high-quality early learning programs. ""When I was in graduate school, I worked for a time as a teacher at Conte Community School in Connecticut where I saw firsthand how programs that meet the needs of the whole child support the development of social and emotional skills, promote academic success, and improve overall wellbeing,"" said Ranking Member of the House Appropriations Committee Rosa DeLauro. ""Over four years as Chair of the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education Appropriations Subcommittee, funding for full-service community schools was one of my top priorities, and I was proud to expand the program nearly tenfold from $17.5 million in fiscal year 2019 to $150 million in fiscal year 2023. I look forward to working with the Biden-Harris Administration to maintain and expand these investments in future budgets."" This announcement comes as Secretary Cardona is visiting a full-service community school district in Boise, Idaho, that is supported by United Way of Treasure Valley, a recipient of this year’s grant announcement. More information can be found here . This year’s grantees will support 102 school districts, 292 schools, and 229,549 students by providing a range of services, including by increasing early learning opportunities and expanding cross-agency coordination for community violence interventions. The new grantees are committed to implementing the four pillars of evidence-based community schools that improve achievement and other outcomes for students: 1) integrated student supports that address out-of-school barriers to learning through partnerships with social and health service agencies and providers; 2) expanded and enriched learning time and opportunities; 3) active family and community engagement; and 4) collaborative leadership and practices. The awards will help grow local capacity to support community schools (Capacity Building and Development grants); build partnerships across school district lines to implement and sustain community schools (Multi-Local Agency Grants); and expand State-level work to sustain, strengthen, and expand community schools (State Scaling grants). With these new awards, the Biden-Harris Administration has awarded FSCS grants in 30 states and territories.

The Department also announced a series of actions to address these issues. Today, Friday, November 17, Secretary Cardona traveled to New York City for a meeting with the Muslim-Jewish Advisory Council and leadership from Interfaith America regarding interfaith cooperation in order to protect all students. On Thursday, November 16 , the Department's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) released a list of the higher education and K-12 institutions under investigation for alleged shared ancestry violations of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Also on Thursday, November 16, Deputy Secretary Marten hosted a roundtable with eight principals and superintendents from across the country to hear about strategies being implemented on school campuses to combat hate. Principals represented elementary and secondary schools and superintendents were from a wide array of districts, small and large, urban and rural. All the participants highlighted the importance of creating a learning environment where all students feel safe and have a sense of belonging. On Wednesday, November 15, Secretary Cardona, alongside other Biden-Harris Administration officials, met with Arab, Muslim, and Sikh community leaders to discuss Islamophobia, anti-Arab, and anti-Sikh bigotry, and related forms of hate in schools. Secretary Cardona unequivocally denounced Islamophobia, anti-Arab and anti-Sikh bigotry, antisemitism, and all forms of hate. On Tuesday, November 14, Under Secretary James Kvaal hosted a similar listening session with leaders of twelve colleges and universities to hear about promising and effective strategies being implemented on campuses to counter antisemitism, Islamophobia, and anti-Arab hate since October 7. Participants represented institutions from across the country, including public and private institutions, two-year and four-year colleges, and urban and rural schools. All the institutions shared concerns about the physical and emotional safety of students, faculty, and staff. In addition, numerous best practices were shared that institutions can learn from and adapt to their own campuses. The Department will share these best practices more widely in coming weeks. Also on Tuesday, November 14, the Department released a fact sheet announcing new tools to tackle antisemitism, Islamophobia, and anti-Arab and related forms of discrimination and bias, including a newly released reminding PreK-12 schools and institutions of higher education of their legal obligations under Title VI, and a specialized collections of resources designed to help educators, students, parents, and community members promote religious inclusion and keep students safe from antisemitism, Islamophobia, anti-Arab, and related forms of discrimination.

During the meeting, they discussed new actions and resources the Biden-Harris Administration has announced to counter the alarming uptick in instances of Islamophobia, Antisemitism, and hate-fueled threats and violence more broadly, in schools and college campuses. The Administration officials heard from the leaders about the extremely disturbing pattern of hate and threats of violence in schools and college campuses since the October 7 Hamas terrorist attacks in Israel. Secretary Cardona unequivocally denounced Islamophobia, anti-Arab bigotry, Antisemitism, and all forms of hate. This meeting follows a similar engagement with Jewish leaders to discuss Antisemitism in schools and college campuses. Last week, the U.S. Department of Education’s (Department) Office for Civil Rights (OCR) released a Dear Colleague letter reminding PreK-12 schools and institutions of higher education of their legal obligations under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI) to provide all students, including students who are or are perceived to be Jewish, Israeli, Muslim, Arab, or Palestinian, a school environment free from discrimination based on race, color, or national origin. OCR also expedited its update of its intake form for discrimination complaints under Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, to specifically state that certain forms of Islamophobia and antisemitism are prohibited by this law. The Department also announced a series of resources it has released since the October 7 attacks. The Department’s Center for Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships published a landing page specifically for resources to address Islamophobia. Earlier this month, the White House announced that the Biden-Harris Administration will develop the first-ever U.S. National Strategy to Counter Islamophobia . Under the leadership of President Biden and Vice President Harris, the Administration and the Department will continue to engage with leading organizations and students to hear from them directly and take additional actions to counter Islamophobia, anti-Arab bigotry, and all other forms of hate.

The pandemic’s unprecedented disruptions in their school and social lives exacerbated rates of depression, anxiety, and feelings of hopelessness that were already on the rise. From classrooms to Congress, we all have a role to play in meeting this urgent need. “Schools can be a gateway to crucial mental health services that may otherwise be inaccessible, and at the federal level, the U.S. Department of Education (ED) has focused on two elements of success: people and resources. This includes an investment of $2 billion to create safe, inclusive learning environments for students and hire and train an estimated 14,000 new mental health professionals, as well as collaboration between ED and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to expand access to Medicaid reimbursement for school-based health and mental health services . “As organizations representing state and local leaders, we have worked to equip those leaders with the resources they need to meet the moment. We remain committed to this work but know the best and most lasting solutions will depend on coordination and commitment at every level of government. “Given the exponential impact of coming together, we commit to continue our work as individual organizations, while uplifting the efforts of others, and, where possible, working together, to ensure every student, no matter their zip code, has access to mental health supports.”"

The list of K-12 schools and institutions of higher education that are under investigation for possible discrimination based on shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics will be updated weekly on the OCR website. ""Hate has no place in our schools, period. When students are targeted because they are—or are perceived to be—Jewish, Muslim, Arab, Sikh, or any other ethnicity or shared ancestry, schools must act to ensure safe and inclusive educational environments where everyone is free to learn,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “These investigations underscore how seriously the Biden-Harris Administration, including the U.S. Department of Education, takes our responsibility to protect students from hatred and discrimination.” “We at the Department of Education, like the nation, see the fear students and school communities experience as hate proliferates in schools,” said Assistant Secretary of Education for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon. “As we continue our active enforcement, the Office for Civil Rights is increasing transparency into our investigations for public awareness. As always, I emphasize that the Office for Civil Rights reaches conclusions at the end of investigations and that a school’s appearance on this list does not reflect a conclusion that the law has been violated.” Releasing this list advances President Biden’s promise to protect students , engage school and university leaders, and foster safe, supportive, and inclusive learning environments. The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to putting an end to discrimination including on schools and college campuses. As part of that work, last week the Education Department released a Dear Colleague Letter reminding schools of their legal obligations under Title VI and its implementing regulations (Title VI) to provide all students a school environment free from discrimination based on race, color, or national origin, including shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics. The letter provides greater clarity about the requirements of the law on discrimination based on shared ancestry, as requested by institutions and students. All colleges, and universities and K-12 schools receiving federal funds must comply with Title VI. Schools that violate the law and refuse to address the problems identified by OCR can ultimately lose federal funding or be referred to the U.S. Department of Justice for further action. Additional resources in this area include a fact sheet, Protecting Students from Discrimination Based on Shared Ancestry or Ethnic Characteristics , released in January 2023, and a Dear Colleague Letter issued in May 2023 as part of the Department’s launch of an Antisemitism Awareness Campaign. For more information about the Department of Education’s work on shared ancestry discrimination, please see the OCR website on Race, Color, or National Origin Discrimination . The list below reflects institutions that are currently under investigation for possible discrimination based on shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics in Fiscal Year 2024 as of November 16, 2023.

Schools that receive federal financial assistance have a responsibility to address discrimination when the discrimination involves racial, ethnic, or ancestral slurs or stereotypes; or is based on a student’s skin color, physical features, or style of dress that reflects both ethnic and religious traditions, to name a few characteristics. Likewise, schools have a responsibility to address discrimination against students based on the region of the world they come from or are perceived to come from. OCR is responsible for enforcing federal civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination by educational institutions on the basis of disability, race, color, national origin, sex, and age, as well as the Boy Scouts of America Equal Access Act of 2001. OCR’s investigations typically include collecting and analyzing relevant evidence from the complainant, the institution, and other sources; conducting interviews of the complainant, the institution’s personnel, and other witnesses; and conducting site visits, if appropriate.

""Being Bilingual is a Superpower” will promote and further the understanding of bilingualism and biliteracy as an educational and economic imperative for student success, global competitiveness, and engagement. The new initiative under the Department's Office of English Language Acquisition (OELA) seeks to promote research-based bilingual educational opportunities and language instruction in early learning education settings and beyond. “Make no mistake: multilingualism is a superpower. Knowing more than one language, acquiring a new language through school, or learning new languages later in life can provide tangible academic, cognitive, economic and sociocultural advantages,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “As our nation continues to grow more diverse, and as our global economy becomes more interconnected, we cannot seize our nation's full potential to compete and lead the world unless we Raise the Bar and provide all students with opportunities to become multilingual.” The Department will host a national convening with education leaders and stakeholders on Thursday, November 16 in Washington, D.C. The event will be an opportunity to hear Secretary Cardona’s vision and the Department’s efforts and actions to provide every student a pathway to multilingualism. It will also include a roundtable conversation with experts from around the country who have created and implemented the policies, processes, programs, and practices necessary for English Learners and all students to have access to high-quality language programs. With the support of bilingual voices of Members of Congress and educational leaders, the Department is galvanizing the broader education ecosystem to prioritize multilingual learning to meet the needs of diverse communities and to ensure 21st century career readiness and global competitiveness. Data shows that approximately only 20 percent of the U.S. population speaks more than one language. To underscore the need for bilingual and multilingual education, OELA announced last year nearly $120 million in investments to eligible institutions of higher education and public or private entities with relevant experience and capacity to support educators of English learner students. The Secretary also proposed to reorganize its Title III programming, which supports the success of English Learners, back into the Office of English Language Acquisition. In support of the Secretary’s multilingual agenda and its goals, the Department awarded $33.2 million in 24 new grants to Native Hawaiian educational and community-based organizations and entities in Hawaii through the Native Hawaiian Education (NHE) program. The NHE program funds innovative educational programs to assist Native Hawaiians and recognizes the important role that the Native Hawaiian language and culture play in the educational success and long-term well-being of Native Hawaiian students. Grant funds will be used to address critical areas of need identified by the Native Hawaiian Education Council, including Hawaiian language-medium instruction and culture-based education programs, mental health and social-emotional well-being initiatives, and elementary school and secondary school renovation projects at schools that serve a predominantly Native Hawaiian student body. The newly funded projects will also address the impact of COVID-19 on students and educators, helping ensure student learning is accelerated in order to meet challenging academic content standards. Grantees operating statewide and in Maui, Hawaii will also support the long-term recovery for students impacted by the August 2023 wildfires, which displaced thousands of Lahaina students and educators The Department has also awarded nearly $2 million in grants under the Native American and Alaska Native Children in School Program (NAM), to enhance capacity and provide effective instruction and support to Native American students who are English learners. In addition to the priority for the preservation and revitalization of Native American languages, this competition included a competitive priority on promoting equity in student access to educational resources, opportunities, and welcoming environments. This competition also encouraged a focus on strengthening cross-agency coordination and community engagement to advance Native American languages while increasing English-language proficiency. Additionally, the Department released a letter from Secretary Cardona to families, educators, and leaders to share resources for English Learner students, including Raise the Bar Metrics and data visualizations, the completed English Language Family Toolkit , and a Seal of Biliteracy Infographic . These resources provide educators and leaders with how to make sure English Learners and Multilingual Learners can meaningfully participate in education programs and their families with information that will empower them to support their children. The entire toolkit has been translated into Chinese, Spanish, and Arabic. OELA’s Family Toolkit app will also be available along with the release of the full Toolkit in Arabic, English, Chinese, and Spanish, and accessible on Android and Apple devices.

15-Nov-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-education-departments-office-civil-rights-releases-new-civil-rights-data-students%E2%80%99-access-educational-opportunities-during-pandemic,U.S. Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights Releases New Civil Rights Data on Students’ Access to Educational Opportunities During the Pandemic,"The U.S. Department of Education’s (Department) Office for Civil Rights (OCR) today released new civil rights data from the 2020–21 school year, offering critical insight regarding civil rights indicators during that coronavirus pandemic year. OCR also released seven data reports and snapshots, including A First Look: Students’ Access to Educational Opportunities in the Nation’s Public Schools , which provides an overview of these data and information. “In America, talent and creativity can come from anywhere, but only if we provide equitable educational opportunities to students everywhere,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “We cannot be complacent when the data repeatedly tells us that the race, sex, or disability of students continue to dramatically impact everything from access to advanced placement courses to the availability of school counselors to the use of exclusionary and traumatic disciplinary practices. The Biden-Harris Administration has prioritized equity for underserved students throughout our historic investments in education, and we will continue to partner with states, districts, and schools to Raise the Bar and provide all students with access to an academically rigorous education in safe, supportive, and inclusive learning environments.” OCR’s Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC) is a mandatory survey of public schools serving students from preschool to grade 12. The purpose of the CRDC is to provide the federal government and members of the public with vital data about the extent to which students have equal educational opportunities required by federal civil rights laws. While OCR generally collects the CRDC biennially, the 2020-21 CRDC is the first published since the 2017-18 collection (which was released in 2020), because OCR paused the collection due to the pandemic. OCR’s 2020-21 CRDC contains information collected from over 17,000 school districts and over 97,000 schools. These data include student enrollment; access to courses, teachers, other school staff, and the Internet and devices; and school climate factors, such as student discipline, harassment or bullying, and school offenses. The 2020-21 CRDC reflects stark inequities in education access throughout the nation. For example, high schools with high enrollments of Black and Latino students offered fewer courses in mathematics, science, and computer science than schools with low enrollments of Black and Latino students. English learner students and students with disabilities, who received services under the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, had a lower rate of enrollment in mathematics and science courses when compared to enrollment rates of all high school students. “These new CRDC data reflect troubling differences in students’ experiences in our nation’s schools,” said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon. “We remain committed to working with school communities to ensure the full civil rights protections that federal law demands.” As part of today’s release of the 2020-21 CRDC, OCR launched a redesigned CRDC website that now includes an archival tool with access to historical civil rights data from 1968 to 1998 which can be found here . The 2020-21 CRDC public-use data file, reports, and snapshots are available on the Department’s redesigned CRDC website. Additional reports and snapshots will be posted periodically on the website. Key data points from the 2020–21 CRDC are below and highlighted in one or more of the data reports or snapshots. K-12 students reported to school employees over 42,500 allegations of harassment or bullying on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, race, disability, or religion. Forty percent of allegations of harassment or bullying was on the basis of sex, 29% was on the basis of race, 19% was on the basis of sexual orientation, 9% was on the basis of disability, and 3% was on the basis of religion. Student reports of being harassed or bullied differed by race and sex. Black students represented 15% of K-12 enrollment, but 37% of students who reported being harassed or bullied on the basis of race. White students represented 46% of K-12 enrollment but 68% of students who reported being harassed or bullied on the basis of sex, and 70% of students who reported being harassed or bullied on the basis of disability. American Indian or Alaska Native students represented 1% of K-12 enrollment, but 2% of students who reported being harassed or bullied on the basis of race, sex, or disability. Boys were overrepresented in reports of being harassed or bullied on the basis of race or disability. Girls were overrepresented in reports of being harassed or bullied on the basis of sex. School Offenses Districts reported approximately 274,700 incidents of school offenses. The majority of incidents (78%) were threats of physical attack without a weapon. Public schools reported over 3,000 incidents of rape or attempted rape and sexual assault (other than rape). About 180 schools (less than 1%) reported at least one incident involving a school shooting, and about 100 schools (less than 1%) reported a homicide of a student, faculty member, or staff member. Student Discipline About 786,600 students in K-12 received one or more in-school suspensions, about 638,700 received one or more out-of-school suspensions, and about 28,300 received an expulsion. Compared to their overall enrollments, Black boys and girls, White boys, and boys of two or more races were overrepresented among K-12 students who were suspended and expelled. Both White and Black boys were overrepresented in K-12 school discipline outcomes, but Black boys were nearly two times more likely than White boys to receive an out-of-school suspension or an expulsion. When considering their overall enrollment, K-12 students with disabilities were also overrepresented in discipline outcomes . Students with disabilities represented 17% of K-12 student enrollment but accounted for 29% of students who received one or more out-of-school suspensions and 21% who received expulsions. The nation’s public school districts referred approximately 61,900 K-12 students to law enforcement, and about 14% of those referrals resulted in school-related arrests. These disciplinary actions differed by students’ race/ethnicity and disability. Black students represented 15% of K-12 student enrollment, but 18% of students referred to law enforcement and 22% of students subjected to a school-related arrest. White students represented 46% of K-12 student enrollment, but 55% of students referred to law enforcement and 47% of students subjected to a school-related arrest. Students with disabilities represented 17% of K-12 student enrollment, but 27% of students referred to law enforcement and 28% of students subjected to a school-related arrest. Restraint and Seclusion Approximately 52,800 K-12 students were physically restrained, mechanically restrained, and/or placed in seclusion at schools. Boys, Black students, students of two or more races, and students with disabilities who received services under IDEA were subjected to restraints and seclusion at higher percentages than their overall K-12 enrollments. Boys represented 51% of K-12 student enrollment, but 83% of students physically restrained, 82% of students mechanically restrained, and 82% of students secluded. Black students represented 15% of the K-12 student enrollment, but 21% of students physically restrained, 42% of students mechanically restrained, and 19% of students secluded. Students of two or more races were 4% of K-12 student enrollment yet accounted for 7% of students physically restrained and 7% of students secluded. Students with disabilities who received services under IDEA represented 14% of K-12 student enrollment but accounted for 81% of students physically restrained, 32% of students mechanically restrained, and 75% of students secluded. Access to Advanced Courses More than half of high schools nationwide do not offer calculus or computer science. Some student groups have fewer opportunities to access courses. Approximately 35% of high schools with high enrollments of Black and Latino students offered calculus, compared to 54% of high schools with low enrollments of Black and Latino students. About 40% of schools with high enrollments of Black and Latino students offered computer science courses, compared to 54% of schools with low enrollments of Black and Latino students. Student enrollment in Advanced Placement (AP) courses differed by race or ethnicity. Black students represented 15% of students enrolled in high school, but 10% of students enrolled in AP computer science, 8% of students enrolled in AP science, and 6% of students enrolled in AP mathematics. Latino students represented 27% of students enrolled in high school, but 20% of students enrolled in AP science, 20% of students enrolled in AP computer science,and 19% of students enrolled in AP mathematics. White students represented 48% of students enrolled in high school, 53% of students enrolled in AP mathematics, 51% of students enrolled in AP science, and 44% of students enrolled in AP computer science. Asian students represented 5% of all high school enrollment, 17% of student enrollment in AP science, 17% of student enrollment in AP mathematics, and 22% of student enrollment in AP computer science. Access to Teachers and Other School Staff Many students, particularly students of color, did not have access to certified teachers and school counselors. Approximately 522,400 students, or 1% of overall student enrollment, attended public schools where fewer than half of the teachers met all state certification requirements. Of students attending those schools, a majority (66%) were Black and Latino students. Ninety-six percent (96%) of high school students had access to at least one school counselor. Four percent (4%) of high school students attended schools with no school counselors. 7 million students attended a school with a school law enforcement officer (SLEO) or security guard, but without a school counselor. Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander students and American Indian or Alaska Native students were 1.4 times more likely than White students to attend a school with an SLEO or security guard but no school counselor. Black students and students of two or more races were 1.2 times more likely attend these schools compared to White students. Access to the Internet and Devices For the first time, for the 2020-21 school year, schools were required to report data on students’ access to the Internet and devices at schools. Students’ Internet access varied from state to state. Kentucky, Maryland, North Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia reported that 99% or more of their schools were connected to the Internet. The states reporting the lowest percentage of schools connected to the Internet were Florida (66%) and Alaska (52%). Eighty-seven percent of schools reported allowing students to take home school-issued devices. The Department’s data reports and snapshots are available here and listed below. A First Look: Students’ Access to Educational Opportunities in the Nation’s Public Schools highlights data from the 2020–21 CRDC on student enrollment, access to preschool programs, access to mathematics, science and computer science courses and other programs, Internet and devices, teachers and school support staff, and school climate factors. Student Discipline and School Climate in U.S. Public Schools highlights data from the 2020–21 CRDC on student discipline, such as suspensions, expulsion, referrals to law enforcement, school-related arrests, and corporal punishment; student harassment or bullying; and incidents of offenses.

The Department will release additional data reports and snapshots on key topics such as student access to courses and programs and data specific to English learner students and to students with disabilities."
15-Nov-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-releases-new-data-highlighting-how-simplified-streamlined-and-redesigned-better-fafsa%C2%AE-form-will-help-deliver-maximum-pell-grants-15-million-more-students,"U.S. Department of Education Releases New Data Highlighting How the Simplified, Streamlined, and Redesigned Better FAFSA® Form Will Help Deliver Maximum Pell Grants to 1.5 Million More Students","The U.S. Department of Education (Department) today released new state-by-state data and details showing that the simplified, streamlined, and redesigned 2024–25 Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form will help 610,000 new students from low-income backgrounds receive Federal Pell Grants. The new FAFSA form will also help 1.5 million more students receive the maximum Pell Grant – bringing the total number of students eligible for the maximum Pell Grant amount to more than 5.2 million. The changes to the FAFSA form represent the most ambitious and significant redesign of the processes to apply for federal student aid and the formulas used to determine aid eligibility since the Common Financial Aid Form—the FAFSA form’s predecessor—was introduced in the Reagan era. The updates are a part of the Department’s implementation of the bipartisan FUTURE Act and FAFSA Simplification Act. It is the vision and commitment of the Biden-Harris Administration to deliver a better FAFSA form and experience for students and families. The better FAFSA form will be available for students and parents by Dec. 31, 2023. Because the better FAFSA form is a major transition for students, families, schools, and other partners, the Department looks forward to working with schools, states, and college access organizations to support students and their families. “When students and families fill out the better FAFSA form, they will find that applying for college financial aid is simpler, easier, and faster than ever before,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “The Biden-Harris Administration’s implementation of the Bipartisan FAFSA Simplification Act modernizes an archaic system, simplifies the form, and improves access for underserved students -- representing the most significant overhaul of the federal financial aid application since the Reagan era. These bold changes will ultimately put affordable higher education within reach of more Americans, including 610,000 students from low-income families who will become eligible for Pell Grants for the very first time.” Expanded Access The better FAFSA redesign goes well beyond just a new form. Starting with the 2024–25 award year, the better FAFSA form reflects updates to student aid calculations that will extend Pell Grants to more students. Pell Grant eligibility will be linked to family size and the federal poverty level. These changes will help significantly expand access to federal student aid. Approximately 610,000 new students from low-income backgrounds will receive Pell Grants, driven primarily by the changes to these eligibility rules. Moreover, Pell recipients will receive more aid with nearly 1.5 million more students receiving the maximum Pell Grant. “Pell Grants are a critical lifeline for millions of students and families to attend college or career school and pursue the American dream,” said Federal Student Aid Chief Operating Officer Richard Cordray. “We are deeply committed to making sure students from all backgrounds can easily apply for and receive the federal student aid they need through the better FAFSA form. In every state and the District of Columbia, more students than ever before will benefit from greater access to Pell Grants.” A state-by-state breakdown of the impacts of the better FAFSA form follows: State Increase in Number of Pell Recipients Increase in Number of Maximum Pell Recipients Alabama 7,941 22,498 Alaska 1,045 2,103 Arizona 29,678 62,897 Arkansas 4,140 11,676 California 59,005 177,362 Colorado 14,128 25,465 Connecticut 5,053 14,951 Delaware 1,612 3,725 District of Columbia 2,468 6,957 Florida 44,810 113,245 Georgia 16,463 49,223 Hawaii 1,881 3,691 Idaho 4,669 9,159 Illinois 21,917 52,902 Indiana 14,175 30,249 Iowa 6,603 13,590 Kansas 6,222 14,018 Kentucky 8,160 18,400 Louisiana 6,770 19,362 Maine 2,579 5,092 Maryland 7,398 20,310 Massachusetts 12,221 25,441 Michigan 19,844 38,031 Minnesota 12,853 29,275 Mississippi 4,625 13,872 Missouri 10,919 24,540 Montana 1,462 3,497 Nebraska 5,685 10,172 Nevada 5,227 10,729 New Hampshire 12,391 24,089 New Jersey 8,802 30,453 New Mexico 3,525 7,370 New York 23,313 75,756 North Carolina 16,489 45,852 North Dakota 1,649 2,837 Ohio 22,567 45,927 Oklahoma 7,550 17,870 Oregon 7,209 15,001 Pennsylvania 18,899 41,774 Rhode Island 2,859 6,096 South Carolina 9,186 19,378 South Dakota 2,007 3,893 Tennessee 14,470 31,590 Texas 51,296 132,667 Utah 20,131 39,049 Vermont 1,292 2,295 Virginia 16,626 37,916 Washington 14,797 23,731 West Virginia 4,960 11,516 Wisconsin 9,993 20,663 Wyoming 832 2,117 Total 610,000 1,489,015 A Better FAFSA Form This overhaul is critical as students and families often struggle to complete the FAFSA form, which may be unfamiliar and confusing. Even simple questions such as, “who is my parent for the FAFSA?” can be difficult to answer. That’s why the Department has embedded a new “Who’s My FAFSA Parent?” wizard to the form to reduce the burden of one of the most frequently asked FAFSA topics for almost 8.6 million dependent students who are asked to answer the question. For the approximately 300,000 students who are experiencing homelessness or are unable to obtain their parents’ income information, because they are not in touch with their parents, they will be able to complete the FAFSA form and receive a provisional eligibility calculation before needing to provide additional documentation. Millions of students and parents will benefit from the Department’s ongoing efforts to streamline the FAFSA experience—where applicants only see relevant questions, based on the answers they provide. In the 2024–25 FAFSA form, applicants will be able to skip as many as 26 FAFSA questions, depending on their individual circumstances. Some applicants will have to answer as few as 18 questions on the form, down from 103 possible questions on the 2023–24 FAFSA form. This not only saves time and reduces anxiety for students and their families, it means more students will successfully complete the form and get access to federal student aid they deserve and open the doors to a college education. In March 2023, the Department launched the Better FAFSA Better Future Roadmap that provided a suite of new resources to help students, their families, schools, states, and the college access organizations that support students and families, navigate the revamped FAFSA experience. The resources in the FAFSA Roadmap are far more expansive from prior FAFSA seasons, and many have been released much earlier in the cycle to give our partners as much time as possible to prepare for the form’s launch. Today the Department is announcing further updates to the Roadmap to provide additional support to ready our partners for the 2024–25 FAFSA season. Helpful Tools and Information for Students and Families The Department remains committed to ensuring all students receive the federal student aid they need to access higher education and unlock a brighter future. In preparation for the new 2024–25 FAFSA experience, the Department has developed tools and resources to help students and families understand the changes and prepare to apply. These include: Outreach campaign about preparing for the FAFSA launch, Videos and infographics that include a preview of the improved FAFSA experience, and A revised Federal Student Aid Estimator , which provides an estimate of how much federal student aid the student may be eligible to receive. Support for Postsecondary Schools and State Agencies The Department will continue to work with our institutional partners to support them in providing students with timely financial aid packages. Since its launch in March 2023, the Better FAFSA Better Future Roadmap has received more than 90,000 visits. The Department has conducted 12 virtual training sessions with a total of more than 60,000 live attendees and thousands of additional recorded views. There have been more than 80,000 views of guidance the Department has provided to schools about the 2024–25 FAFSA implementation. This work will continue until the full launch of the 2024–25 FAFSA experience. In addition, the Department also will continue to provide targeted support to under-resourced schools through special training sessions and technical assistance, including guidance and training for communicating with vulnerable student populations. Resources for Counselors, Mentors, and College Access Organizations The Department will continue to work with partners to ensure we are providing additional resources, such as trainings, guidance documents, and sample files, needed to ensure a successful FAFSA season for students, schools, and partners. To support college access professionals, the Department has launched a “Better FAFSA Better Future” digital Toolkit , that includes many resources, such as videos, factsheets, social media posts, and sample email content. The Department has supported in person training of more than 1,000 college counselors and recently completed a two-day FAFSA “Bootcamp” for parents and college counselors with more than 24,000 registrants. The Department’s Continued Efforts to Build a Better FAFSA Experience As of the 2023–24 award year—which started on July 1, 2023—the Department already implemented several changes to the better FAFSA form as part of its ongoing efforts to streamline the form. For example, students who are incarcerated in federal and state penal facilities have regained the ability to receive a Pell Grant, and the Pell Grant lifetime eligibility was restored to students whose school closed while they were enrolled or if the school is found to have misled the student. As required by statute, the Department completely removed both the drug conviction and the Selective Service questions from the 2023–24 FAFSA form; these questions are no longer considered in determining a student’s eligibility for federal student aid. The Department also implemented changes to the cost of attendance, professional judgment, and independent student statuses for the 2023–24 award year. Additionally, the Department: Released technical references and guides to system application processing changes on a rolling basis and in draft form to better assist with vendors’ software development; Outlined a schedule of 17 new guidance documents—far more than the five to seven released in a typical year—to assist schools in their delivery of aid and compliance with new laws; Presented multiple sessions about the better FAFSA changes during the 2022 Federal Student Aid Training Conference , including details about Pell Grants and Prison Education Programs , use of federal tax information , 2024–25 FAFSA processing changes , and 2024–25 FAFSA form/experience changes ; and Announced session topics for Federal Student Aid’s virtual 2023 Training Conference —which will be broadcast from Nov. 28 to Dec. 1, 2023—including, a better FAFSA update, FAFSA Simplification Act policy updates, and an update about Prison Education Programs."
14-Nov-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/fact-sheet-us-department-education-announces-new-tools-tackle-antisemitism-islamophobia-and-related-forms-discrimination-and-bias,"FACT SHEET: The U.S. Department of Education Announces New Tools to Tackle Antisemitism, Islamophobia, and Related Forms of Discrimination and Bias","In May 2023, President Biden announced the historic U.S. National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism . This whole-of-government approach represents the most comprehensive and ambitious U.S. government effort to counter antisemitism in American history. The White House also announced this month that the Biden-Harris Administration will develop the first-ever U.S. National Strategy to Counter Islamophobia . Building upon these commitments, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) is announcing new resources aimed at ensuring schools and college campuses have the tools they need to protect students from discrimination and harassment because of their race, color, or national origin, including students who are or are perceived to be Jewish, Muslim, Israeli, Arab, or Palestinian. ""Hate has no place in our school classrooms or on our college campuses. Antisemitism, Islamophobia, and all forms of hate are antithetical to who we are as Americans,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""The Biden-Harris Administration and this Department are working tirelessly to uphold the civil rights of students of all backgrounds, including students who are, or who are perceived to be, Jewish, Israeli, Muslim, Arab, or Palestinian, or of any other shared ancestry. All students have the right to learn in safe and inclusive educational environments."" New Resources to Keep Students Safe in the Classroom and on Campuses The Department is sharing resources for students, educators, and communities that can be used to strengthen school safety efforts, such as funding from the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which provided $1 billion to districts to design and enhance initiatives to promote safer, more inclusive, and positive school environments for all students, educators, and school staff. In addition, guidance is being provided by Department-funded technical assistance centers such as its 4 regional equity assistance centers and the National Center on Safe Supportive Learning Environments (NCSSLE). Equity Assistance Centers provide technical assistance and training, upon request, in the areas of race, sex, national origin, and religion to public school districts and other responsible governmental agencies to promote equitable education opportunities. NCSSLE is releasing two collections of specialized resources designed to help educators, students, parents, and community members keep students safe from antisemitism, Islamophobia, and related forms of discrimination. One collection is designed for P-12 schools and the other for institutions of higher education . On December 6th, the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education will launch a webinar series for P-12 school personnel and community-based organizations to develop, strengthen, and share evidence-informed strategies that help schools prevent and respond to hate-based threats, bullying, and harassment. The webinar series kicks off with a session on ""Creating a Welcoming Environment"" on Dec. 6, followed by webinars on ""Full Student Participation"" on Dec. 13, ""Conflict Mediation"" on Jan. 17, and ""Ongoing Support"" in February. This week, senior leaders of the Department will also host listening sessions with P-12 school leaders and postsecondary institution leaders to glean key insights from the field about how some schools are keeping students safe in the wake of the Israel-Hamas conflict. Listening sessions with Jewish students, educators, and staff are ongoing, and listening sessions with Muslim, Arab, Palestinian, Sikh and other students impacted by Islamophobia are planned in the next few weeks. The Department will also, as part of its ongoing Antisemitism Awareness Campaign, spotlight notable efforts by students, communities, educators, and administrators to prevent and address antisemitism, and will disseminate information about these efforts to offer concrete examples of ways schools and campuses can engage in similar efforts. Additionally, the Center for Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships (CFBNP) will share effective strategies for school and campus communities to be more inclusive of Jewish, Muslim, and other religious identities, such as multifaith student groups, afterschool programs, or school-based efforts aimed at fostering cross-community cooperation. Protecting students from antisemitism, Islamophobia, and related forms of discrimination and bias is essential to our broader fight against all forms of hate, bigotry, and bias—and to our broader vision of a thriving, inclusive, and diverse democracy. The Department has taken key steps to help realize this vision and keep students safe, including the launch of its Antisemitism Awareness Campaign , aimed at raising awareness among educators, students, parents, and communities about the alarming rise of antisemitism and giving them tools to address it. Implementation of the campaign is led by CFBNP, with close coordination with the Office for Civil Rights (OCR), alongside the Offices of the Secretary, Deputy Secretary, and Under Secretary, OESE, the Office for Postsecondary Education, the Office of Planning Evaluation and Policy Development, and others. Additional key steps to tackle antisemitism, Islamophobia, and related forms of discrimination and bias include: Protections under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act On November 7, OCR released a Dear Colleague letter reminding PreK-12 schools and institutions of higher education of their legal obligations under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI) to provide all students, including students who are or are perceived to be Jewish, Israeli, Muslim, Arab, or Palestinian, a school environment free from discrimination based on race, color, or national origin. OCR also recently released an updated complaint form specifying that Title VI's protection from discrimination based on race, color, or national origin extends to students who are or are perceived to be Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, or Sikh, or based on other shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics. This update will help individuals understand how to file a Title VI complaint. Anyone who believes that a school has discriminated against a student based on race, color, or national origin can file a complaint of discrimination with OCR. The person who files the complaint does not need to have been the target of the alleged violation, but could be a family member, or faculty, staff, or any other concerned community member who is aware of possible discrimination. OCR is available to provide technical assistance through trainings to school communities as well as community organizations regarding Title VI, including its application to Jewish and Muslim students and its coverage of certain forms of antisemitic and Islamophobic discrimination. OCR welcome requests for training which can be submitted to OCR@ed.gov OCR will continue to collect data on allegations of harassment or bullying based on religion, as it has since the 2013-14 Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC). For the 2021-22 CRDC, schools will be required to report allegations of harassment or bullying based on 14 categories of a student's perceived religion, including Judaism and Islam. OCR will begin collecting data from public schools serving students in preschool through grade 12 for the 2021-22 school year in December 2023. Direct Engagement with American Jewish, Arab, Muslim, and Other Impacted Communities On October 30, Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff, Secretary Miguel Cardona, Deputy Secretary Cindy Marten, US Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism Ambassador Deborah Lipstadt, and other senior Biden-Harris Administration officials met with the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations to discuss the alarming rise of antisemitism on campuses. During the meeting , they discussed actions the Biden-Harris Administration is taking to counter the alarming uptick in instances of Antisemitism at schools and college campuses. Administration officials heard from Jewish leaders about the extremely disturbing pattern of Antisemitic threats of violence in schools and college campuses since the October 7 Hamas terrorist attacks in Israel. As part of the Department's Antisemitism Awareness Campaign , this fall Secretary Cardona, Deputy Secretary Cindy Marten and other senior administration officials conducted site visits to PreK-12 schools and institutions of higher education in order to hold listening sessions with Jewish students and to share notable examples of actions that students, communities, educators, and administrators are taking to prevent and address antisemitism and promote inclusion of all students. The Department is conducting meetings and listening sessions with students, faculty, staff, and community leaders from Muslim as well as Arab, Sikh, and other impacted groups to gain more insights about how to support them in ensuring that students of all backgrounds are free to learn. Earlier this year, CFBNP hosted a conference entitled, ""Free to Learn: Inclusion, Rights, and Accommodations for Students of All Faiths and None,"" in person and livestreamed, for educators, administrators, and community leaders. The conference featured multiple tracks, including sessions on civil rights protections at educational institutions and Jewish and Muslim students' experiences of discrimination. Resources related to the Department-wide Free to Learn initiative can be found here . More information from the CFBNP can be found on its landing pages on countering antisemitism and countering Islamophobia . The Department will continue to promote technical assistance opportunities to help school and campus communities improve awareness of religious cultures and practices and accommodation of religious observances."
9-Nov-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-announces-framework-student-loan-servicer-accountability-protect-borrowers-nationwide,Biden-Harris Administration Announces Framework for Student Loan Servicer Accountability To Protect Borrowers Nationwide,"The Biden-Harris Administration is fully committed to supporting student loan borrowers as they navigate return to repayment and fixing problems in the student loan system. To further the goal of protecting borrowers nationwide, the Biden-Harris Administration is taking steps to hold student loan servicers accountable for meeting their obligations to students, borrowers, and taxpayers when managing student loans. Today, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) is outlining a framework for how it will increase student loan servicer accountability and make sure borrowers are not harmed by servicer errors. The framework’s strategies help the Department to encourage servicers to better support borrowers and allows the Department to hold their feet to the fire when they have servicing failures. “The Biden-Harris Administration has made clear that we will not allow borrowers to pay the price for unacceptable servicing failures,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “Today’s announcement should send a clear message to all our contracted student loan servicers that the Department will use the full scope of our oversight and accountability tools to ensure borrowers get the level of service they deserve. As the Biden-Harris team works to fix our country’s broken student loan system, we will continue to put the needs of borrowers first and do whatever it takes to support Americans’ success as they return to repayment.” “The loan servicing environment has changed drastically since the Department began working with multiple servicers in 2009,” said Federal Student Aid (FSA) Chief Operating Officer Richard Cordray. “FSA is committed to ensuring servicing contracts evolve to meet borrowers' needs. The return to repayment is an unprecedented time in the Direct Loan program, and in 2024, we will transition to new contracts that provide us with updated requirements for servicers and more ways to ensure borrowers get the support they deserve."" Framework for Student Loan Servicer Oversight and Accountability to Protect Borrowers Under this Administration, the Department has implemented an oversight strategy of federal student loan servicers that provides several pathways for identifying in real time problems that can harm borrowers. The Department’s oversight specifically focused on the borrower experience includes monitoring servicers, tracking complaints, and examining results-based outcomes. These oversight and accountability tools are used in combination to ensure a comprehensive review of servicer performance. The Department takes several steps to monitor servicers across different channels and uses its enforcement tools when necessary. Servicer Oversight - Monitoring The Department’s stringent monitoring work has detected servicer errors that occurred and has allowed the Department to quickly address any challenges facing borrowers. Leading up to the return to repayment, the Department instituted several of the strategies outlined below including secret shopper campaigns and enhanced data monitoring so that errors could be detected swiftly and corrective action taken. The regular monitoring of our loan servicers ensures they are providing quality customer service and are accurately processing borrower payments and applications. The Department takes a risk-based approach to overseeing loan servicers by leveraging borrower complaints, customer satisfaction surveys, interagency referrals, data monitoring, random sampling and servicer self-reporting. The Department is deploying the following strategies to strengthen servicer oversight and monitoring: Direct servicer monitoring : Under this approach, FSA staff monitor the quality of customer service provided by loan servicers. FSA listens to and scores servicers’ customer service representatives interacting with borrowers, reviews borrower calls, reviews customer chats and conducts secret shopper calls to measure the accuracy of servicers’ responses to borrowers’ questions. FSA staff also conducts secret shopper campaigns on broad return to repayment issues as well as specialty servicing issues such as questions on Public Service Loan Forgiveness. Partnering with federal and state regulators : The Department cooperates with other government agencies, such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and state attorneys general, which are tasked with enforcing consumer financial laws. The Department took steps earlier this year to update its interpretation of federal preemption to clarify states’ authority to enforce state consumer protection laws to facilitate close coordination between the Department and its state partners. Such close coordination and cooperation further nhance both servicer accountability and borrower protections. Leveraging borrower complaints: This includes complaints filed through FSA’s Office of the Ombudsman, which works closely with the oversight team to determine if complaints are part of a larger servicer issue. The Department also conducts regular monitoring of social media and news stories to track what borrowers are reporting to see whether these complaints are isolated instances or an error that is impacting a broader subset of borrowers. These listening tools are a crucial part of the monitoring process as borrowers are best able to report the issues that may be directly impacting their repayment. Servicer Accountability – Actions When the Department detects performance issues that do not meet our standards, it has the ability to take actions against servicers. The Biden-Harris Administration will continue to use the following tools to protect borrowers from poor servicer conduct: Withholding Payment : When servicers do not meet their contractual obligations or are not meeting acceptable standards, the Department has the authority to withhold payments based on the number of borrowers who are not being served. On October 30, 2023, the Department announced it was withholding $7.2 million from MOHELA for its failure to send timely billing statements to 2.5 million borrowers. Suspending or Re-allocating Borrowers : If servicers show they are unable to perform their duties for the borrowers they manage, the Department can suspend the allocation of additional borrowers, or re-allocate borrowers to other servicers. The Department also has the authority to allocate new loans to high-performing servicers. Withholding accounts has direct financial impacts on servicers, because their compensation is largely driven by monthly fees for each borrower they service. Therefore, fewer accounts lead to lower payments moving forward. Contractor Performance Reports (CPARS): The Department creates summary reports for each servicer that use the government-wide grading system regarding various aspects of the servicer’s work. CPARS are used as a factor when servicers are competing for new contracts, so poor CPARS scores could result in a loss of future revenue. Corrective Action Plan (CAP) : The Department requires servicers to fix servicing errors through remediation plans. The Department requires a servicer to submit a plan to ensure that borrowers are made whole and that proper controls are put in place to ensure the problem does not happen again. Helping borrowers harmed by servicer issues In addition to detecting servicer issues and taking action to address them, the Department also has a strategy to protect borrowers from servicer mistakes. When certain types of errors are detected, the Department directs servicers to place affected borrowers into a short administrative forbearance while the errors are resolved. In certain circumstances where a borrower’s progress toward loan forgiveness may be harmed by potential servicer errors, the Department has directed servicers to count those periods in administrative forbearance toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness and income-driven repayment forgiveness and adjust accrued interest to zero. Moving toward a modern servicing system – Unified Servicing and Data Solution (USDS) The Department will enhance its ability to reward servicers for positive results and hold servicers accountable for poor performance through the transition to the USDS. The Department previously announced it will transition to the new loan servicing environment in spring 2024, which will provide the strengthened security, accountability, and transparency provisions that current legacy contracts do not. USDS will allow the Department to create a loan servicing environment that better serves borrowers and increase oversight ability for the more than 37 million borrowers with federally managed student loans, more than 28 million of whom have returned to repayment. The USDS contract brings several benefits related to servicer accountability. USDS will allow a stronger focus on performance improvement by financially rewarding servicers that keep at-risk borrowers in a current repayment status. These incentives will drive servicers to further invest in innovative strategies to reach borrowers at risk of delinquency and default. USDS will also provide increased cost transparency and allow the Department to better track servicer performance and incentivize servicers to meet Department standards. The Department takes very seriously its responsibility to oversee servicers and ensure borrowers have a smooth and successful repayment experience. The Department will continue to monitor performance, communicate with servicers and borrowers, and take corrective action where needed. The oversight and accountability mechanisms outlined show the Department’s clear commitment to a better student loan system that prioritizes borrower success and a repayment system that puts borrowers first."
9-Nov-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-premiers-public-service-announcement-elevating-teaching-profession,Biden-Harris Administration Premiers Public Service Announcement Elevating the Teaching Profession,"The U.S. Department of Education today launched its campaign to elevate the teaching profession and promote educator diversity. The campaign titled “Teachers: Leaders Shaping Lives” is headlined by a new Public Service Announcement (PSA) developed in partnership with TEACH.org and One Million Teachers of Color. The goal of the PSA is to inspire more talented people—especially those from underrepresented communities—to become teachers, while also elevating the teaching profession and celebrating our teachers. The PSA premiered on LinkedIn’s LinkedIn Live and will appear in media markets across the country via television, radio, and social media. To watch the PSA, click here . Today’s announcement builds on the Department’s commitment to accelerating academic recovery by working with state and local leaders to elevate the teaching profession and address educator shortages. As a result of these efforts, as of October 2023, local public education employment has nearly rebounded to pre-pandemic levels, now roughly at the same levels as October 2019, the last pre-pandemic beginning of a school year. At the height of the pandemic, there were 730,000, or 9 percent, fewer local public education employees than before the pandemic. As of October 2023, there are only 0.17 percent fewer employees in local public education than four years prior. We know that when shortages of qualified educators exist, they disproportionately impact students from low-income backgrounds, students of color, students with disabilities, and multilingual learners. “I’ll never forget the positive influence that my first teacher of color, Mr. Gary O’Neil, had on me. My personal experience is backed up by years of research illustrating that all students benefit from having diverse and talented educators in the classroom,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “This campaign reflects the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to elevating the teaching profession and encouraging more talented people, and especially those from underrepresented communities, to pursue fulfilling and impactful careers as educators. At the Department, our efforts to help states and districts grow a talented and diverse teacher pipeline are at the core of our efforts to Raise the Bar in education and build on President Biden’s historic investments in America’s public schools. I’m proud that, thanks in large part to these efforts, we have already reduced the educator shortage to a fraction of what it was during the pandemic.” “Over the past two decades, the K-12 student population has become much more racially diverse, but that same trend in diversity is not reflected in teachers and school leaders,” said Dr. Javaid Siddiqi, president and CEO of the Hunt Institute. “The ‘One Million Teachers of Color’ campaign is pleased to partner with TEACH.org and the U.S. Department of Education to highlight the needs of our educator workforce in order to address the underrepresentation in our schools. This collective movement will support our goal of increasing the number of teachers of color by one million by 2030.” “We know that the existing teacher diversity gap has an adverse impact on students and that all students would benefit from having more teachers of color. TEACH.org envisions a day when every classroom has a quality teacher, and every student has access to educators who reflect the diversity of their community. This campaign highlights the expertise and innovation teachers bring to their work and will inspire diverse change makers who want to make an impact in an intellectually stimulating, fulfilling, and fun profession,"" said Zachary Levine, executive director of TEACH.org. This progress to date on eliminating educator shortages is a result of the systematic efforts by the U.S. Department of Education, with partners across the Biden-Harris Administration, to advance key strategies to restore staffing in our schools and ensure all students have access to well-prepared and fully qualified teachers and school leaders. School districts are estimated to spend nearly $30 billion of their American Rescue Plan Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ARP ESSER) funds on staffing, including on these critical strategies. In addition, in fiscal year (FY) 2023, the Department has invested $2.76 billion in the nation’s educators through its grant programs, $93 million more than invested in FY 2021. The Department has worked to increase teacher compensation and improve working and learning conditions , which are critical to educator recruitment and retention, and increasing the diversity of the profession. President Biden and Secretary Cardona have repeatedly called for leaders at all levels to increase educator pay and provide teachers with a livable and competitive wage. Since 2021-2022, at least 29 states and the District of Columbia have taken concrete steps at the state or system level to increase compensation. This Department map provides transparency into teacher pay, and state action to address it. The Department is increasing access to high-quality and affordable pathways into the teaching profession, like grow your own programs and teacher residency programs. The Department has partnered with the Department of Labor to expand Registered Apprenticeship Programs for teachers, a high-quality earn-while-you-learn model that can be used to scale grow your own and residency programs and break down financial barriers to accessing high-quality pathways and entering the profession. There were no registered apprenticeship programs for teachers at the beginning of the Biden-Harris Administration, yet as of November, 28 states and Puerto Rico now have registered programs. In FY 2023, the Department awarded $14.5 million in new Teacher Quality Partnership awards and more than $35 million in funding for 138 new Personnel Development Program projects to support high-quality pathways into the profession and address key shortage areas such as special education. The Department is increasing educator diversity to address shortages and improve student outcomes. In FY 2022, the Department included priorities focused on educator diversity in 14 grant programs, resulting in 165 awards totaling $370 million, 93 percent of which were to grantees to undertake activities related to educator diversity. In FY 2023, the Department awarded additional funds from 15 grant programs with these priorities, awarding nearly $450 million to 263 grantees, 92 percent of which addressed educator diversity priorities. This includes awarding the first-ever funds for the Hawkins Centers of Excellence Program, investing in educator preparation programs at Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal Colleges or Universities, Hispanic Serving Institutions, and other Minority Serving Institutions. This week, the Department also released a new policy brief, Raise the Bar Policy Brief: Eliminating Educator Shortages through Increasing Educator Diversity and Addressing High-need Shortage Areas , which highlights key Department efforts to support and advance educator diversity and address high-need shortage areas, as well as national and state data on teacher diversity and areas in which states have particular shortages. This builds on the Department’s July Raise the Bar Policy Brief: Eliminating Educator Shortages through Increased Compensation, High-Quality and Affordable Educator Preparation and Teacher Leadership . At the end of October, the Department hosted the Teach to Lead Summit and the Conference on Equity in Opportunity , which brought together leaders to highlight effective practices for increasing educator diversity and identify new strategies for advancing this work. The Department is investing in supports for school leaders, who play a critical role in shaping school climate and educator working conditions. The Department also is investing in current teachers who help them succeed and stay in the profession, including through high-quality new teacher induction programs, job-embedded professional learning throughout educators’ careers, and career advancement and leadership opportunities. This includes, in FY23, awarding nearly $115 million in Teacher and School Leader Incentive awards, more than $6 million the first-ever Native American Teacher Retention Initiative program, and $12.7 in Supporting Effective Educator Development Grants ."
9-Nov-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-convenes-higher-education-leaders-improve-student-transfer-increase-completion-college-degrees,Biden-Harris Administration Convenes Higher Education Leaders to Improve Student Transfer to Increase Completion of College Degrees,"As part of its Raise the Bar: Attaining College Excellence and Equity initiative , the U.S. Department of Education is hosting a summit today at Northern Virginia Community College (NOVA) in Annadale, Virginia with 200 higher education leaders on making it easier for students to transfer from one college to another, in turn helping them save time and money. The Department is also releasing groundbreaking new data showing which two- and four-year institutions are best promoting transfer students’ success and highlighting the most productive transfer partnerships between community college and bachelors’ degree institutions in the country. The difficulty students face in transferring between colleges is one of the most significant obstacles to helping many more students earn college degrees. While nearly 40% of students transfer at some point along their postsecondary journeys, they lose more than 40% of their credits on average when they move between schools. This costs students time, money, and too often the credentials they seek to earn. As part of the response to the Supreme Court decision in Students for Fair Admissions, the Biden-Harris Administration emphasized in a White House meeting with college presidents and a report on strategies to increase diversity and opportunity in higher education the importance of supporting community college transfer students. Given that many students of color and students with low incomes start their higher learning at community colleges, improving transfer pipelines from two-year to four-year colleges is a key strategy that states and institutions can consider as they commit to missions of greater diversity. “If we want to Raise the Bar for educational attainment in this country and create more equitable outcomes in higher education, then we need leaders to dramatically level up their support for transfer students,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “Our current higher education system stacks the deck against community college students who aspire to earn four-year degrees—denying acceptance of their credits, forcing them to retake courses, and ultimately making their educational journeys longer and costlier than they need to be. In the wake of a Supreme Court decision that threatens to undermine diversity and equal opportunity in higher education, the Biden-Harris Administration believes that fixing our broken approach to transfer in this country, which disproportionately impacts students of color and other underserved students, has never mattered more.” The Department also released today groundbreaking new data on transfers that spotlights the top two-year and four-year institutional partnership in each state. Despite the large number of transfer students, there has been little public data on how well particular colleges serve them. Among those top-performing partnerships is NOVA, the host institution for the event, and George Mason University (GMU). Thirteen percent of new federally aided students who enroll at NOVA earn bachelor’s degrees from GMU within eight years, reflecting a high transfer rate between the two institutions and a strong graduation rate after transfer. The Department’s research also found that this partnership is an important factor in the high rate at which Virginia community college students go on to earn bachelor’s degrees, compared to other states. The data also identified other strong partnerships such as Irvine Valley College with California State University-Fullerton (13%), Heartland Community College with Illinois State University (13%), and the Tri-County Technical College with Clemson University (20%). The summit includes teams of institutional and state representatives from 11 states from across the country: California, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia, and Washington. At the convening, participants will make commitments to support effective state transfer policy, institutional transfer policy and practice, transfer student advising and navigation, and data- and technology-enabled transfer solutions. “At today’s summit, the Biden-Harris Administration will not only uplift successful efforts for promoting transfer student success, but also release new data on transfer outcomes across institutions that we hope will help leaders build a more accessible and inclusive higher education system,” said Assistant Secretary of Postsecondary Education Nasser Paydar. Participants in the summit will also discuss their initiatives and commitments to improving transfer. Mildred Garcia, Chancellor of the California State University said, “As the first Latina chancellor of the nation’s largest and most diverse four-year university system – half a million students strong – I thank Secretary Cardona for his visionary leadership in advancing educational excellence and equity. These values are the CSU’s values, and we are committed to strengthening transfer pathways to provide increased educational opportunities for the future diverse leaders who will drive California’s social and economic prosperity.” “While 80% of community college students intend to transfer, fewer than 20% make it to a four-year institution and complete a bachelor’s degree. It’s imperative that higher education works together to help these students who are disproportionately first generation, low-income, working parents, and students of color—complete the transfer process, graduate, and enter the workforce. I am honored to be part of this summit to learn new approaches that support transfer student success,” said Joe Garcia, Chancellor of the Colorado Community College System. The transfer summit is part of the Department’s Raise the Bar: Attaining College Excellence and Equity initiative . Raise the Bar seeks to uplift colleges committed to inclusivity, equity, and excellence, rather than arbitrary rankings, high costs, and privilege. Raise the Bar encourages state and institutional leaders to ensure students of all backgrounds can earn a college degree or certificate and go on to a better life. Building on this year’s summits on data-driven improvement and transfer students, next year the Department will convene leaders to address holistic advising and wraparound services and career-relevant learning pathways in order to help more institutions increase completion rates, close completion gaps, and ensure all students are earning completions of value that lead to economic opportunity.

8-Nov-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-announces-nearly-55-million-borrowers-are-enrolled-save-plan,Biden-Harris Administration Announces Nearly 5.5 Million Borrowers Are Enrolled in the SAVE Plan,"The Biden-Harris Administration released data today showing that nearly 5.5 million borrowers are now enrolled in the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) Plan, including 2.9 million who have $0 payments. All other borrowers enrolled in SAVE are saving an estimated $102 a month ($1,224 a year) compared to what they would have paid on the Revised Pay As You Earn (REPAYE) plan. Overall, enrollment in SAVE has grown by 60% since it replaced the Revised Pay As You Earn (REPAYE) Plan this summer. The data, released by the U.S. Department of Education (Department), are based upon enrollment as of October 15, 2023. “Under President Biden, the Department created the SAVE Plan so that young people and working families can climb the economic ladder without unaffordable student loan debt weighing them down,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “I’m thrilled to see that in less than three months, nearly 5.5 million Americans in every community across the country are taking advantage of the SAVE Plan’s many benefits, from lower monthly payments to protection from runaway student loan interest. The Biden-Harris Administration will not rest in its efforts to fix the broken student loan system and make paying for college more affordable.” The updated SAVE enrollment figure includes 1.8 million borrowers new to an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan and 364,000 who switched to SAVE from a different IDR plan since September 2023. Overall, borrowers are repaying $300 billion in federal student loans on the plan, about one-quarter of all Direct Loans in repayment, deferment, or forbearance. The SAVE Plan is providing significant savings for borrowers compared to the previous REPAYE plan. The majority of SAVE enrollees today have $0 payments, while borrowers who still owe a payment are saving an estimated $102 a month ($1,224 a year). These savings are providing real relief to borrowers and their families, especially those who are disproportionately impacted by student debt, like borrowers of color and low-income borrowers. Borrowers are also seeing separate savings from not being charged unpaid monthly interest. These benefits are particularly critical as Department data show that 75% of SAVE borrowers also received Pell Grants, which are awarded to low-income college students. Under the SAVE Plan, single borrowers who earn less than $32,800 per year or those in a family of four making less than $67,000 have a $0 payment. The SAVE Plan also ensures that a borrower’s balance will never grow due to unpaid interest as long as they are making their monthly payments. The improved IDR application allows borrowers to have their income securely accessed through the Internal Revenue Service, so they do not need to re-certify their incomes or reapply for IDR plans each year. Savings for borrowers will increase again when the Department implements further payment reductions for undergraduate loans next year, as well as earlier loan forgiveness for smaller loans. Today, the Department is also releasing data on the number of borrowers enrolled in SAVE by state and congressional district. California and Texas each have more than 450,000 borrowers enrolled in SAVE, while congressional districts in Missouri, Ohio, and Michigan have the highest identified enrollment. Data also show that there are borrowers enrolled in SAVE in each congressional district. The data can be found here . The SAVE Plan builds on the Biden-Harris Administration’s work to reduce the burden of student debt on America’s families. The Biden-Harris Administration has already approved $127 billion in targeted relief for nearly 3.6 million borrowers. The Administration is currently in the process of proposing revisions to regulations that would make more borrowers eligible for loan forgiveness. It also recently finalized regulations that help create the strongest accountability system ever for colleges that leave students with unaffordable debts. “The SAVE Plan will significantly cut monthly bills for most borrowers, reduce loan default, and ensure that students loans don’t need to come before life necessities,” said Under Secretary James Kvaal. “With nearly 5.5 million people enrolled after only two months, it’s clear how much borrowers need a plan like SAVE. President Biden and our Administration remain committed to giving borrowers breathing room on their monthly payments and ensuring student loans aren’t a barrier to opportunity.”"
7-Nov-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-reminds-schools-their-legal-obligation-address-discrimination-including-harassment,"U.S. Department of Education Reminds Schools of Their Legal Obligation to Address Discrimination, Including Harassment","As part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s continued efforts to take aggressive action to address the alarming rise in reports of antisemitic, Islamophobic, and other hate-based or bias-based incidents at schools and on college campuses since the October 7th Israel-Hamas conflict, today the U.S. Department of Education’s (Department) Office for Civil Rights (OCR) released a new Dear Colleague Letter reminding schools of their legal obligations under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI) to provide all students, including students who are or are perceived to be Jewish, Israeli, Muslim, Arab, or Palestinian, a school environment free from discrimination based on race, color, or national origin. The Biden-Harris Administration is implementing the U.S. National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism , and the White House also announced last week that the Biden-Harris Administration will develop a U.S. National Strategy to Counter Islamophobia. The Department will continue to complete actions under the strategy to counter antisemitism and anticipates additional actions under its purview will result from the forthcoming strategy to counter Islamophobia. “The rise of reports of hate incidents on our college campuses in the wake of the Israel-Hamas conflict is deeply traumatic for students and should be alarming to all Americans. Antisemitism, Islamophobia, and all other forms of hatred go against everything we stand for as a nation,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to upholding the civil rights of students of all backgrounds, including students who are, or who are perceived to be, Jewish, Israeli, Muslim, Arab, or Palestinian or of any other shared ancestry. College and university leaders must be unequivocal about condemning hatred and violence and work harder than ever to ensure all students have the freedom to learn in safe and inclusive campus communities.” Today’s announcement comes on the heels of Secretary Cardona’s and White House Domestic Policy Advisor Neera Tanden’s visit to the Baltimore Hebrew Institute at Towson University last week. The leaders held a roundtable discussion with Jewish students from several Baltimore-area universities as part of the Department’s Antisemitism Awareness Campaign , initiated under the Biden-Harris Administration’s National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism. In recent weeks, as part of its Antisemitism Awareness Campaign, the Department has conducted site visits in cities across the country to address and learn about antisemitism at schools and college campuses. OCR also recently released an updated complaint form specifying that Title VI’s protection from discrimination based on race, color, or national origin extends to students who are or are perceived to be Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, or Sikh, or based on other shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics. This update will help individuals understand how to file a Title VI complaint. Anyone who believes that a school has discriminated against a student based on race, color, or national origin can file a complaint of discrimination with OCR. The person who files the complaint does not need to have been the target of the alleged violation, but could be a family member, or faculty, staff, or any other concerned community member who is aware of possible discrimination. To file a complaint, visit https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/complaintintro.html . The Department is available to provide technical assistance webinars on the application of Title VI to discrimination based on race, color, or national origin as described in the letter released today. To request such a training, please contact OCR at OCR@ed.gov . “Through this letter we urge school communities to be vigilant of your students’ rights under Title VI, understanding that we in OCR are and will be,” said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon. “Jewish students, Israeli students, Muslim students, Arab students, and Palestinian students, and all other students who reside within our school communities have the right to learn in our nation’s schools free from discrimination.” Title VI’s protection from race, color, or national origin discrimination extends to students who experience discrimination, including harassment, based on their actual or perceived: (i) shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics; or (ii) citizenship or residency in a country with a dominant religion or distinct religious identity. Schools that receive federal financial assistance have a responsibility to address discrimination when the discrimination involves racial, ethnic, or ancestral slurs or stereotypes; when the discrimination is based on a student’s skin color, physical features, or style of dress that reflects both ethnic and religious traditions, to name a few characteristics. Likewise, schools have a responsibility to address discrimination against students based on the region of the world they come from or are perceived to come from. Today’s newly released documents are among several resources released by OCR to support schools in complying with their obligations under Title VI to address discrimination based on race, color, or national origin, including shared ancestry and ethnic characteristics. Additional resources in this area include a fact sheet, Protecting Students from Discrimination Based on Shared Ancestry or Ethnic Characteristics , released in January 2023, and a Dear Colleague Letter issued in May 2023 as part of the Department’s launch of an Antisemitism Awareness Campaign. These resources are available on the Shared Ancestry or Ethnic Characteristics page of OCR’s website. Information about recently resolved complaints under Title VI, including complaints alleging discrimination based on shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics, is available here ."
31-Oct-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-office-federal-student-aid-fines-grand-canyon-university-377-million-deceiving-thousands-students,U.S. Department of Education Office of Federal Student Aid Fines Grand Canyon University $37.7 Million for Deceiving Thousands of Students,"The U.S. Department of Education (Department) office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) today announced a $37.7 million fine against Grand Canyon University (GCU), which disbursed the most federal student aid of all participating institutions for the past four award years. An FSA investigation found GCU lied to more than 7,500 former and current students about the cost of its doctoral programs over several years. GCU falsely advertised a lower cost than what 98% of students ended up paying to complete certain doctoral programs. “GCU lied about the cost of its doctoral programs to attract students to enroll,” said FSA Chief Operating Officer Richard Cordray. “FSA takes its oversight responsibilities seriously. GCU’s lies harmed students, broke their trust, and led to unexpectedly high levels of student debt. Today, we are holding GCU accountable for its actions, protecting students and taxpayers, and upholding the integrity of the federal student aid programs.” GCU has 20 days to request a hearing with the Department’s Office of Hearings and Appeals or submit written material to FSA indicating why the fine should not be imposed. In addition to the fine, the Department imposed specific conditions on the school to continue participating in the federal student aid programs. Widespread misrepresentations related to the cost of doctoral programs FSA’s investigation determined that as far back as 2017, GCU was not fully informing students about the cost of its doctoral programs. GCU stated that those doctoral programs cost between $40,000 and $49,000. GCU made these false claims about the cost on the school’s website and net price calculators, as well as in its enrollment agreements, catalogs, policy handbooks, and other marketing materials. These false claims violate the Higher Education Act and federal regulations prohibiting substantial misrepresentations. Based upon these substantial misrepresentations, the Department also determined that GCU failed to adhere to the fiduciary standard required of a Title IV participant. GCU’s statements about the total cost to complete these programs were false and misleading because, based on GCU’s own data, less than 2% of graduates completed within the cost that GCU advertised. For the vast majority of graduates, “continuation courses”—which added extra costs—were necessary to complete the dissertation requirement in these doctoral programs. GCU’s data further shows that 78% of the graduates in those programs had to pay $10,000 to $12,000 more in tuition costs—roughly a 25% increase, depending on the program—than GCU explicitly advertised. When given an opportunity to respond to the Department’s evidence, GCU pointed to a series of fine print disclosures included in some of its enrollment agreements and other documents distributed to students. These disclosures are insufficient to cure the substantial misrepresentations regarding cost. The new disclosures fail to address or correct the significant misrepresentations about the cost of the program. Furthermore, the disclosures are also buried in dense documents and are much less prominent than the misrepresentations. As a result, they do not cure the “net impression” that the program will be less expensive than it actually is. GCU did not contest FSA’s determination that 98% of students enrolled in certain doctoral programs had to pay more than GCU’s advertised cost. In Award Year 2020–21, GCU enrolled more than 100,000 students. GCU offers certificate, undergraduate, and graduate degree programs through in-person and online instruction. Holding GCU accountable and protecting students and taxpayers Last month, FSA added five specific conditions to GCU’s Provisional Program Participation Agreement (PPPA) : Condition A: GCU shall not make substantial misrepresentations related to the cost of obtaining a degree in its doctoral programs, and if GCU informs prospective or current doctoral students about the cost of completing its doctoral programs, it must tell students the average total tuition and fees paid by graduates and the maximum number of credits that a student can take that are eligible for Title IV funds. Condition B: GCU must engage a monitor to oversee its compliance with Condition A. Condition C: GCU must report quarterly to the Department about investigations, actions, or other legal proceedings by its accrediting agency or any government agency and must report pending litigation in which a plaintiff seeks class certification. Condition D: GCU must send a notice to all currently enrolled doctoral students informing them how to use the Department’s feedback center to submit a complaint to the Department. Condition E: GCU must send a notice to all current employees who provide recruiting, admissions, and other services to doctoral students about how to use the FSA Tips line to submit information about misconduct or violations. The PPPA governs GCU’s participation in federal student aid programs for the next three years. Today’s action demonstrates the Department’s ongoing commitment to enforcing higher education laws and regulations and protecting students, taxpayers, and the integrity of the federal student aid programs."
31-Oct-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-educations-office-civil-rights-reaches-agreement-resolve-sexual-harassment-investigation-arcadia-university-pennsylvania,U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights Reaches Agreement to Resolve Sexual Harassment Investigation of Arcadia University in Pennsylvania,"The U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) today announced the resolution of a sexual harassment investigation of Arcadia University in Pennsylvania. OCR determined that the university violated Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX), when it failed to investigate possible sexual harassment by a university professor despite the university repeatedly receiving reports over several years from students and faculty that the professor harassed students. OCR also determined that when the university finally initiated an investigation into allegations that the professor sexually harassed his students, the university did not complete its investigation once the professor tendered his resignation, violating the university’s Title IX obligations to determine whether sex discrimination occurred and to redress any hostile environment students may have suffered. OCR’s investigation established that several students and faculty reported to the university from 2018 to 2021 that the professor repeatedly engaged in sexual harassment of female students. The sexually harassing conduct was reported to the then-chief of human resources and a dean. OCR also obtained evidence showing that students reported the professor’s sexually harassing conduct in the professor’s course evaluations from 2019 onward. For example, a student stated that “[t]he professor made many sexual inappropriate comments on a regular basis. Everyone felt uncomfortable . . .” Another student wrote that “[t]here was a lot of strange comments of [a] sexual nature.” One university staff member – the former chief of human resources – mistakenly believed that she could not pursue an investigation because the professor was tenured, and that the conduct alleged did not state a Title IX claim because no allegation was made of inappropriate touching. OCR also obtained evidence showing that the former chief of human resources believed that the professor retaliated against the students who first reported his conduct by accusing the students of cheating but that the university did not address these concerns. After years of receiving reports about the professor’s alleged sexual harassment of students, the university finally initiated an investigation of the professor in 2021 in response to a formal complaint. Despite initiating an investigation in response to these complaints, the university incorrectly ceased all further Title IX activities once the professor tendered his resignation following the scheduling of a hearing on the allegations of possible sexual harassment. OCR concluded that the university violated Title IX, including because it failed to satisfy its obligation to address any effects of sexual harassment on impacted students, notwithstanding the professor’s resignation. “Arcadia University first ignored repeated notice that a professor serially harassed university students and then compounded the discriminatory harm – in violation of Title IX – when it ended its investigation based on the professor’s resignation, without determining whether university students needed action to end and redress a hostile environment resulting from multiyear sexual harassment,” said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon. “Title IX requires more than Arcadia University provided here, and I appreciate the university’s commitment now to address that wrong and ensure that students learn in the university environment free from sex discrimination.” The resolution agreement requires the university to take several steps, including: Assign a third party to complete its investigation of the formal complaint against the professor and, if the conduct alleged is substantiated, and created a hostile environment on the basis of sex, offer individual remedies to the individuals who filed the formal complaint. Conduct a comprehensive investigation of the professor’s actions for a period of four years to determine whether his actions created a hostile environment on the basis of sex for other students, and if so, offer appropriate remedies. Conduct a review of all Title IX complaints of student- and staff-involved sexual harassment for a period of three years, to ensure that each complaint was resolved in compliance with Title IX, and if not, provide appropriate remedies. Provide to OCR documentation of Title IX case file reviews for a period of two years. Conduct a climate survey with students, and provide OCR a summary of the survey results and the university’s proposed corrective actions in response to the survey results for OCR approval. And, Revise the university’s Title IX Policy and Procedures, provide Title IX training to university faculty and staff, and post its Title IX training materials on its website. The resolution letter and resolution agreement are available on the Office for Civil Rights website ."
30-Oct-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-continues-efforts-provide-debt-relief-more-student-loan-borrowers,Biden-Harris Administration Continues Efforts to Provide Debt Relief for More Student Loan Borrowers,"The Biden-Harris Administration today continued its critical efforts to deliver student debt relief to as many borrowers as possible through negotiated rulemaking under the Higher Education Act by releasing draft regulatory text for specific categories of borrowers and outlining next steps to consider relief options for borrowers experiencing hardship. Forgiveness delivered to borrowers through negotiated rulemaking will build on the historic actions the Biden-Harris Administration has already taken to provide student debt relief to millions of Americans. To date, the Biden-Harris Administration has approved $127 billion in debt relief for nearly 3.6 million borrowers and launched the most affordable student loan repayment plan in history, the SAVE plan. “President Biden and I are committed to helping borrowers who’ve been failed by our country’s broken and unaffordable student loan system,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “These draft proposals would build on the historic $127 billion in loan forgiveness the Biden-Harris Administration has already approved for nearly 3.6 million borrowers. We are fighting to ensure that student debt does not stand in the way of opportunity or prevent borrowers from realizing the benefits of their higher education.” The draft regulatory text released today provides negotiators and the public more details as the Department of Education (Department) works toward trying to reach consensus on proposals. The draft regulatory text includes language to provide debt relief for four groups of borrowers, including those who: Currently have outstanding federal student loan balances that exceed what they originally borrowed. Have loans that first entered repayment 25 or more years ago. Took out loans to attend career-training programs that created unreasonable debt loads or provided insufficient earnings for graduates, as well as borrowers who attended institutions with unacceptably high student loan default rates. The Secretary determines are eligible for forgiveness under repayment plans like income-driven repayment or targeted relief programs like Public Service Loan Forgiveness or closed school loan discharges except they have not applied for such relief. The Department also released an issue paper today outlining additional questions and information to guide discussion about a fifth group of borrowers—those who are experiencing financial hardship that the current student loan system does not currently adequately address. The issue paper outlines concepts raised during the first negotiating session that require further development and discussion to identify potential regulatory proposals for the third session or future policymaking efforts. Questions in the paper include which types of borrowers may be experiencing hardship, whether standards used to make improvements to the bankruptcy process could be applied to student debt relief, and what data would be needed to determine whether a borrower is facing hardship. In addition to discussing the draft regulatory text, negotiators will spend the afternoon of the second day of the session discussing the issue of hardship. The session will take place on November 6 and 7 from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. The committee is comprised of non-federal negotiators from 16 affected constituency groups, as well as a negotiator from the Department. Negotiators will have an opportunity to discuss the regulatory text and hardship paper over the two days. There will also be up to one hour for public comment each day from 3 p.m. to 4 p.m. Through this process, the Department will continue to refine regulatory text in advance of the third session December 11 and 12. The public will have an opportunity to submit written comments on the draft rules when they are published next year. Updates on the student debt relief rulemaking process will be posted here . This includes a transcript and archived video of the first session, which took place October 10 and 11. Members of the public who wish to view the sessions or provide public testimony can also find a link on that page where they can register to do so. Continuing to provide debt relief and support borrowers Today’s announcement builds on the work the Biden-Harris Administration has already done to improve the student loan program and make higher education more affordable. This includes approving $127 billion in relief for nearly 3.6 million borrowers, including: Nearly $42 billion for almost 855,000 borrowers who are eligible for forgiveness through income-driven repayment by fixing historical inaccuracies in the count of payments that qualify toward forgiveness. Almost $51 billion for 715,000 public servants through Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) programs, including the limited PSLF waiver and Temporary Expanded PSLF (TEPSLF). $11.7 billion for almost 513,000 borrowers with a total and permanent disability. $22.5 billion for more than 1.3 million borrowers who were cheated by their schools, saw their institutions precipitously close, or are covered by related court settlements. The Biden-Harris Administration remains committed to making college more affordable and also ensuring student debt is not a roadblock to attaining a college degree or credential and planning for the future. The Administration launched the most affordable student loan repayment plan ever—the SAVE Plan—earlier this year, has made the largest increase to Pell Grants in a decade, and has charted a course to double the maximum Pell Grant and make community college free to enhance college affordability and reduce unnecessary student debt. The Administration is also holding institutions accountable for unaffordable debts and recently proposed regulations that would set standards for graduate earnings and debt outcomes for career programs, while enhancing transparency for all programs to give students the information they need to make informed choices."
30-Oct-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-announces-withholding-payment-student-loan-servicer-part-accountability-measures-harmed-borrowers,U.S. Department of Education Announces Withholding of Payment to Student Loan Servicer as Part of Accountability Measures for Harmed Borrowers,"U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona and Federal Student Aid (FSA) Chief Operating Officer Rich Cordray issued the following statements on actions taken by the U.S. Department of Education (Department) after student loan servicer errors were found by the Department. Recently, the Department found that MOHELA failed to meet its basic obligation by failing to send billing statements on time to 2.5 million borrowers – some within only seven days of their payment date - and over 800,000 borrowers being delinquent on their loans as a result. In response to identifying this error, the Department is withholding $7.2 million in payment to MOHELA for October, and has directed MOHELA to place all affected borrowers in forbearance until the issue is resolved. Any months these borrowers are in forbearance will count as credit towards loan forgiveness through Public Service Loan Forgiveness and Income Driven Repayment plans. The Department also identified errors from loan servicers resulting in a small number of borrowers receiving incorrect payment amounts on their billing statements, and borrowers who have pending Borrower Defense claims incorrectly placed back in repayment status. All borrowers affected by these errors will be placed in forbearance by their servicer until the issues are resolved and any months in forbearance will count as credit towards loan forgiveness through Public Service Loan Forgiveness or Income Driven Repayment. The latest actions will both ensure borrowers are held harmless by these servicer errors and that servicers are held accountable for their actions. The Department will continue to monitor servicer performance and ensure they are meeting their basic contractual obligations to the Department and to borrowers. If a servicer fails to meet these basic obligations, additional action may be warranted by the Department. U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona: “The Biden-Harris Administration is looking out for borrowers at every step throughout their return to repayment. Our oversight efforts have uncovered errors from loan servicers that will not be tolerated. We took immediate actions to protect borrowers from the fallout of this error and hold the responsible servicers accountable, including by withholding $7.2 million in payment from one servicer. The actions we've taken send a strong message to all student loan servicers that we will not allow borrowers to suffer the consequences of gross servicing failures. We are committed to fixing our country’s broken student loan system, and that includes strengthening oversight and accountability and taking every step possible to improve outcomes for borrowers.” FSA Chief Operating Officer Rich Cordray: “Our top priority is to support borrowers as they return to repayment and fix the broken student loan system, and we will not tolerate errors from loan servicers that cause confusion and unwarranted financial instability for borrowers and families. “Through vigorous monitoring of borrower accounts, we were able to detect these mistakes and take swift action to remedy them. We are committed to making things right for borrowers and holding our contractors accountable for errors when they do occur. “The Department has directed servicers to place all affected borrowers into administrative forbearance until the problem is fixed. In the meantime, we will adjust to zero any interest that accrues and credit them with progress toward public service loan forgiveness and income-driven repayment. “In strengthening our efforts to hold servicers accountable for errors that harm borrowers, the Department will begin to withhold some funds under our monthly contracts to encourage stronger and more reliable service to borrowers. Due to the failure of MOHELA to meet their basic obligation of delivering on-time statements to borrowers - affecting over 2.5 million people - the Department will be withholding $7,209,735.13 in payments to MOHELA from the month of October for this mistake. These accountability measures will help ensure that future borrowers are not harmed and servicers understand that there are consequences to their actions when they do not meet the terms of their contracts.”"

Through Raise the Bar: Lead the World , the Department is supporting states and school districts to eliminate educator shortages in our nation’s schools. The TSL grants help districts to address educator shortages by supporting career advancement and teacher leadership opportunities, increasing compensation, and improving educator retention. "" All students benefit from a diverse and well-supported educator workforce that can prepare them to lead. While all students benefit from diverse teachers, when students of color see their backgrounds and experiences reflected in their teachers, we see higher levels of academic achievement and student engagement in school, and more students aspiring to be teachers themselves one day. That's why attracting, retaining, and supporting a diverse educator workforce is a top priority in our efforts to Raise the Bar for learning conditions in our schools,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""This nearly $115 million investment will help states and school districts recruit and retain new talent, increase compensation, and address educator shortages that we know disproportionately impact students from our communities of color, students from low-income backgrounds, students with disabilities and English learners."" The FY 2023 TSL grant competition prioritized activities that advance the Department's goal of promoting educator diversity and career advancement opportunities for teachers that improve teacher retention. The funding comes at a critical point for school districts as they face significant hurdles in attracting and retaining the qualified educators and other school staff they need to best support students. These staffing challenges disproportionately impact Black and Latino students, students from low-income backgrounds, students with disabilities, and English learners. The announcement of the awards also comes as the Department hosts the inaugural Conference on Equity in Opportunity and Teach to Lead in Denver, Colorado, where researchers, practitioners, and policy leaders will come together to discuss priorities for a diverse educator workforce, identify hurdles to building a diverse workforce, disseminate and amplify effective practices, and share information about grant funding to increase equity and access to funding opportunities.

24-Oct-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-releases-final-rules-strengthen-accountability-colleges-and-consumer-protection-students,Biden-Harris Administration Releases Final Rules that Strengthen Accountability for Colleges and Consumer Protection for Students,"The Biden-Harris Administration today announced final regulations to significantly enhance oversight and accountability for institutions of higher education and strengthen consumer protections for student borrowers. The new rules will strengthen the U.S. Department of Education’s (Department) ability to protect students and taxpayers from the negative effects of sudden college closures, will restrict colleges from withholding course credits paid for with Federal money from students’ transcripts, and require colleges to clearly communicate to students how much financial aid they will receive—a common source of confusion and error. The regulations, which will go into effect July 1, 2024, directly answer President Biden’s agenda to make college more affordable, hold colleges accountable, and protect taxpayers and consumers. “Too many students have been abandoned by shady colleges that close their doors and leave borrowers with unaffordable debt and little hope of completing their educational journeys and embarking on rewarding careers,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “With these final rules, the Biden-Harris Administration is fixing a broken system, which failed to protect students and families, and addresses abuses in higher education that have cost taxpayers billions of dollars in recent years. We are raising the bar for accountability and making sure that when students invest in higher education, they get a solid return on that investment and a greater shot at the American dream.” In particular, the rules address the Department’s concerns about the substantial number of colleges that have closed abruptly, the largest of which were private for-profit institutions, leaving students in the lurch with few if any options to complete their programs elsewhere and taxpayers on the hook for student loan discharges. Beyond abrupt closures, there have also been many instances in which students struggle to find employment due to their programs not meeting licensure requirements or providing inadequate career services. The final rules cover four areas. (1) Financial responsibility, which relates to situations where the Department can more swiftly obtain financial protection like a letter of credit when a college exhibits warning signs. (2) Administrative capability, which lays out additional areas where institutions must show they have sufficient resources and procedures in place for areas like career services and financial aid communication to participate in the Federal student aid programs. (3) Certification procedures, which addresses the conditions the Department can place in the written agreements it has with colleges to participate in the Federal student aid programs, and (4) Ability to benefit, which lays out a process for States to approve postsecondary programs that serve students who do not have a high school diploma. “Today’s regulations prioritize students and taxpayers and continue our work to fix a broken student loan system,” said Under Secretary of Education James Kvaal. “They will help prevent fly-by-night colleges from leaving students and taxpayers holding the bag for shoddy educations. They will give students some common-sense protections like clear information on the true cost of college and access to their transcripts when their courses were federally funded.” The final regulations make the following changes: Financial Responsibility : The final rules establish warning signs from colleges that make it easier for the Department to secure letters of credit or other forms of upfront financial protection. These include situations such as an institution showing financial risk due to paying a debt, lawsuits by Federal or State actors, or being in danger of losing access to Federal student aid due to having a high cohort default rate. Such changes are critical to both dissuade risky behavior and ensure taxpayers are better protected from the cost of sudden closures. From 2013-2022, the Department sought more than $1.6 billion in liabilities from institutions, but collected only $344 million from institutions during that time period. Administrative Capability : The Department is responsible for ensuring that institutions have the administrative capability to effectively administer the Federal student aid programs. However, when an institution exhibits problems, the Department often lacks the ability to hold institutions accountable. The final rules add several requirements for colleges including: clearer, more comparable information on financial aid, including distinguishing between scholarships and loans that must be repaid; prohibiting colleges from withholding transcripts for Federally funded courses; requiring adequate career services; and limiting the employment of individuals with a history of risky management of the Federal student aid programs. Certification Procedures : The final rules lay out additional conditions the Department can place on institutions when they exhibit warning signs, such as requiring a teach-out plan or agreement or limiting the addition of new programs and locations. The rules also take steps to ensure that student aid is only available for career-training programs that are no longer than State requirements for certification or licensure, including through reciprocity agreements or provisional licensure. Finally, the rules require that institutions certify that institutions operating through distance education will abide by any State laws related to the closure of postsecondary institutions, such as rules for teach-outs, record retention, and tuition recovery or surety bonds. Ability to Benefit : The final Ability to Benefit rules establish clearer processes for access to Federal aid for students who do not have a high school diploma or its recognized equivalent. The rules will increase access to postsecondary education for more students. Today’s announcement builds on the Biden-Harris Administration’s ambitious efforts to hold colleges accountable, protect students and taxpayers, and ensure that all students can afford to get the education and skills they need after high school. Earlier this month, the Department revitalized the gainful employment rule to ensure institutions do their part to deliver real financial value to students and taxpayers. The Department has also approved $127 billion in relief for nearly 3.6 million students, including record amounts of relief for borrowers whose colleges took advantage of them or closed suddenly. President Biden has also championed the largest increase to Pell Grants in a decade and is fighting to put the grant on a path to doubling the maximum award by 2029, while proposing tuition-free community college and new tuition assistance at Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority-Serving Institutions. The Department developed these final rules in response to public comments received following the publication of the draft rules in May. The final regulations was published in the Federal Register on October 31, 2023. View the official copy of final regulations here and a fact sheet on the final rule can be found here ."

OCR found that the college failed to respond as required by Title IX to repeated allegations from one of its students, who is transgender, that college employees harassed the student based on sex for more than a year. The investigation included allegations that a professor told the student, in front of her whole class, that based on her “physical appearance” the professor did not consider the student “feminine enough” and that on another occasion an administrator of the student’s college program knowingly excluded the student when addressing other female students as “ladies” in class. OCR’s investigation also reflected that the college received repeated notice that the student alleged experiencing almost daily harassment including through faculty misgendering the student, but the college did not respond to these allegations to confirm their occurrence or redress the harm the student reported experiencing. As a result, OCR determined that the college subjected the student to a hostile environment based on sex that negatively impacted the student’s education. OCR also identified a compliance concern that the college may not have provided adequate notice to students, staff, and faculty about how to make a complaint of sex-based harassment under Title IX and may have failed to adequately notify the college community of its Title IX coordinator and how to contact this person. The resolution agreement reached today commits the college to take the steps needed to ensure nondiscrimination on the basis of sex in all of its education programs and activities. “Today’s resolution with Taft College addresses harassment experienced by a transgender student based on unlawful sex stereotyping,” said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon. “Taft College has committed to comply with Title IX to protect all its students in the future."" The college’s commitments in the resolution agreement include: Offering to reimburse the student for counseling to address the effects of the sex-based harassment during the student’s enrollment. Reviewing and revising, as necessary, its policies and procedures to clarify that harassment based on sex includes harassment based on sex stereotyping. Training its employees who respond to sex-based harassment about the college’s obligations under Title IX. And, Providing documentation to OCR demonstrating that the college’s responses to complaints of sex-based harassment during the 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 academic years complied with Title IX.

19-Oct-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-awards-14-million-under-first-ever-fostering-diverse-schools-demonstration-grant-program,Biden-Harris Administration Awards $14 Million Under First-Ever Fostering Diverse Schools Demonstration Grant Program,"The U.S. Department of Education (Department) has made $14 million in awards to help support local- and state-driven voluntary efforts to foster more diverse school communities through its first-ever Fostering Diverse Schools Demonstration Program . These grants, in alignment with the Department’s Raise the Bar: Lead the World call to action, support districts as they work to enrich educational experiences by providing every student with a well-rounded education and improved school conditions for student learning, inclusive of a broader perspective on the world. “Every student in America deserves access to a high-quality education, but persistent racial and socioeconomic isolation in our schools continues to result in inadequate resources, lesser access to advanced courses, fewer extracurricular offerings, and other tangible inequities that disproportionately impact students of color and students from low-income backgrounds at every stage of their educational journeys and throughout their lives,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “President Biden always says that diversity is America’s greatest strength, and that is incredibly clear in the classroom, where research shows that students of all backgrounds benefit from learning in diverse environments. Our Fostering Diverse Schools Grant program will support innovative, locally-driven efforts to Raise the Bar for academic achievement and learning conditions in our schools by providing more students with more diverse, more equitable, and ultimately, more enriching learning opportunities.” This grant announcement comes as schools and classrooms have become increasingly more separated along lines of socioeconomic status, race, and ethnicity. Yet, we know that diverse schools and classrooms can benefit every student, regardless of their race or background. The new Fostering Diverse Schools Demonstration program will support voluntary efforts by local school districts to increase school socioeconomic diversity, including by providing new or expanded access to schoolwide specialized academic programs, unique program options, or analyzing the location and capacity of facilities to promote socioeconomic school diversity. This new program further delivers on President Biden’s day-one executive order, to advance racial equity and support for underserved communities through the federal government. Earlier this year, the Department released a report on State of School Diversity in the United States, showing that schools that are isolated along racial or socioeconomic lines often have less access to critical resources and funding. These conditions can perpetuate gaps in opportunity that can limit the chance for underserved students to grow and excel academically. The Department received applications from eligible entities in over 20 states and made 14 new awards for this inaugural cohort of Fostering Diverse Schools grantees. Recipients have committed to working closely with families, students, communities, and school diversity plans through a variety of activities. For example, grantees will engage with students, families, community leaders and staff to better understand the needs of their school communities and how to best address them. Other grantees will provide professional development to support educators who work in under resourced schools and communities. Across the board, grantees will implement well-rounded learning opportunities to expand access to high-quality instruction and enrichment. The Department’s Magnet Schools Assistance Program (MSAP) also aims to foster greater diversity in schools. MSAP provided grants to eligible local education agencies to establish and operate innovative magnet schools, attract a diverse group of students, and help desegregate public schools. The Department awarded $92 million to 16 grantees through MSAP this year. Together with the Fostering Diverse Schools Demonstration Program, the Department invested more than $100 million in the past fiscal year in support of school diversity and equitable access to high-quality education that prepares students to succeed academically in diverse learning environments.

OCR identified compliance concerns regarding district provision of athletic opportunities for female student athletes in components of its athletic program including equipment, scheduling of game times, travel, coaching, locker room and competitive facilities, medical and training facilities, and publicity. Evidence in the investigation included, for example, that the baseball program at the school had two fields for its exclusive use while the softball program at the school had only one softball field. The varsity baseball field also included features that the softball field lacked, such as lighting, a scoreboard, and a PA system. OCR also reviewed evidence that showed some boys’ programs enjoyed access to charter buses for transportation, whereas the girls’ programs lacked such access and may have been required to provide their own transportation to away games and matches. OCR also had concerns that the girls’ programs, as compared to the boys’ programs, may not have had similar quality equipment, equal access to the school’s weight room and athletic trainer, equal access to the school’s athletic locker room, or equitable publicity from the school’s social media accounts. OCR also reviewed evidence suggesting that female athletes had less opportunity to receive coaching than male athletes at the school. The resolution agreement commits the district to take the steps needed to ensure nondiscrimination on the basis of sex in all of its education programs and activities, including athletics. “Today’s resolution with Morgan Hill Unified School District addresses the disparities in the quality and availability of benefits for female athletes that OCR observed in the athletics programs at Live Oak High School,” said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon. “Morgan Hill Unified School District has committed now to provide all its students with equivalent access to athletic opportunities regardless of sex, as Title IX has long required.” The district’s commitments in the resolution agreement include: Creating committees to ensure that differences in fundraising between teams will not create disparities in athletic equipment, uniforms, or supplies based on sex. Renovating the school’s existing varsity softball field to include the same features as its varsity baseball field. Converting the school’s existing practice baseball field to a multipurpose field that can be used for softball and baseball and ensuring that the softball team has equal access to the renovated multipurpose field. Providing equal access to and use of locker room facilities for female athletes, including equitable access to the athletic locker room. Giving female athletes equivalent opportunities to receive coaching. Equalizing the school’s girls’ and boys’ athletics teams’ access and opportunity to use vans, buses, or charter buses for transportation to away games and matches. Training its employees who are involved in athletic programs about the district’s obligations under Title IX and its application to athletics. And, Ensuring the school’s girls’ and boys’ athletics teams have equitable access to the school’s athletic trainer, weight room, and training facilities.

17-Oct-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-educations-office-civil-rights-reaches-agreement-resolve-sexual-harassment-compliance-review-new-london-public-schools-connecticut,U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights Reaches Agreement to Resolve Sexual Harassment Compliance Review of New London Public Schools in Connecticut,"The U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) today resolved a compliance review of New London Public Schools in Connecticut with a resolution agreement to address the district’s handling of sexual assault cases, including those involving student and staff misconduct. OCR found that the district violated Title IX by not ensuring adequate Title IX coordination and oversight during the 2020-2021 and 2021-2022 school years, failing to adopt and publish Title IX grievance procedures that complied with Title IX, and failing to respond equitably to complaints of employee-involved sexual harassment during the review period. Notably, the district abdicated its Title IX responsibilities when it did not independently investigate allegations of sexual harassment of students by two employees while the matters were being investigated by the police and the Connecticut Department of Children and Families. These actions did not comport with the district’s obligation under Title IX to investigate whether sex discrimination occurred and, if so, to provide appropriate support to the victims and school community, and adopt measures to prevent recurrence especially where one or more employees may have been aware of the employee misconduct but failed to report it. OCR also had concerns regarding the adequacy of district Title IX coordination and oversight during the 2020-2021 school year, recordkeeping practices with regard to Title IX complaints, and district responses to complaints of student-involved sexual harassment, including that the district may not have taken sufficient action to end harassment, prevent its recurrence, and remedy its effects such as considering and providing interim measures and remedial measures, where appropriate. The resolution agreement commits the district to take the following steps needed to resolve this investigation: Revise the district’s Title IX grievance procedures to ensure compliance with the Title IX regulation and consistency across related policies and procedures. Modify the district’s current recordkeeping procedures to comply with the Title IX regulation. Provide OCR with the district’s response to all reports and formal complaints of sexual harassment between the 2021-2022 and the 2024-2025 school years. Prepare a written description of the Title IX Coordinator(s)’s responsibilities to ensure compliance with the Title IX regulation and overall coordination of Title IX responsibilities. Conduct annual Title IX training for all district administrators, staff, Title IX Coordinator(s), investigators, decision-makers, and any person who facilitates an informal resolution process. And, Issue a student climate survey to district students in grades 6-12 to assess a need for additional changes. “New London Public Schools’ agreement today addresses serious noncompliance with Title IX that had left district students vulnerable to unredressed – and sometimes serial – sexual harassment from employees as well as other students,” said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon. The letter to New London Public Schools is available here and the resolution agreement is available here ."

Together, these awards seek to strengthen the vitality of Native American languages in schools, support Native American teachers, and ensure Tribal Educational Agencies can coordinate grant resources alongside state and local partners. “Our efforts to Raise the Bar for academic achievement and support multilingual learners in tribal communities must include strengthening and revitalizing Native languages, and supporting the recruitment, retention, leadership, and empowerment of Native American educators,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “These grant funds will provide Native American students with greater opportunities to learn in inclusive environments that uplift their cultures, revitalize their languages, and ultimately, promote their academic success and wellbeing. The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to ensuring Native American students have access to an inclusive and culturally affirming education that’s also reflected in the teachers in their schools.” The NALRC program will support the preservation and use of Native American languages in classrooms across the country. This funding will be dedicated to centers across three geographic regions—Central, Northwest, and West—as well as a national center to provide support to all states and regional center grantees. The centers will provide technical assistance for resource development, dissemination of research, leadership development, capacity-building services, and immersive, interactive learning experiences. The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights “ Broken Promises” report found there is a lack of educational opportunity for Native American students, including access to culturally competent teachers in Indian Country. In a first-ever program of its kind, NATRI will help address the shortage of Native American educators and promote retention by creating opportunities for Native teachers to serve in leadership roles in their schools. Grantees proposed projects that help educators of Native American students better provide culturally appropriate and effective instruction and support for Native American students such as creating professional learning communities, leadership roles for educators, accessible networks to expertise, Native teacher leadership models, mentoring programs, development taskforces, and continuing education credits throughout multiple states impacting dozens of Tribal Nations. Finally, the Department awarded $1.6 million to support the STEP program. STEP grants support projects that strengthen Tribal self-determination and promote coordination and collaboration among tribal, state, and local educational agencies to meet the unique needs of Native students. Funded projects include supporting cross-agency data sharing agreements; culturally responsive Native American student identification; and facilitating systemic change focus areas related to college readiness, workforce development, and family engagement.

12-Oct-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-awards-more-13-million-improve-access-child-care-student-parents,Biden-Harris Administration Awards More Than $13 Million to Improve Access to Child Care for Student Parents,"The Biden-Harris Administration today announced more than $13 million in grants to 34 institutions of higher education to support or establish high quality, campus-based child care programs to meet the needs of student parents with low incomes enrolled on their campuses. More than one in five students are parents and 42% of all student parents attend community colleges. High-quality child care provides benefits to children, their parents, and the economy at large “I am a big believer in campus child care programs because I’ve seen how they break down barriers to upskilling and attaining postsecondary education for parents with young children—bringing the American Dream within reach for families across America,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “Today’s grants will help 34 colleges and universities raise the bar for how they support student parents as they work to earn degrees and credentials that will advance their careers and boost their earning potential. The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to building an inclusive higher education system that’s accessible to students from all walks of life, including parents who dream of better futures for themselves and their families.” For the first time, applicants for the Child Care Access Means Parents in School (CCAMPIS) grant program were encouraged to propose ways to improve the quality of the services they provide, including through higher wages for childcare workers, which in return can significantly reduce turnover and are associated with better care and improved child outcomes. An important, measurable dimension of quality in early childhood settings is the nature of relationships and interactions between early childhood staff and children in the care setting, this year’s competition included an invitational priority aligned with President Biden’s Executive Order on Increasing Access to High-Quality Care and Supporting Caregivers. The invitational priority was for applications from institutions that are working to improve the quality of campus-based childcare provided to the children of low-income student parents, which include increases in compensation and providing support services for early childhood teachers, using Federal and non-Federal funding as appropriate. Twenty-six out of the thirty-four institutions receiving awards will advance this priority as they extend critical child care support to student parents. In addition to the CCAMPIS grants, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) also announced more than $75 million in grant awards it made in three other grant programs with FY23 funds to benefit underserved students at postsecondary institutions. These programs include the Asian American Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institutions (AANAPISI) Part A grant program, the Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs (GEAR UP) state grant program, and the Strengthening Institutions Program (SIP). The Department awarded more than $6 million for 16 grants in the ANNAPISI Part A grant program. Last month, President Biden issued the first-ever Presidential Proclamation for National Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institutions (AANAPISI) Week, and these grants are a key piece of the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to elevate the significance of AANAPISIs and their role in higher education. This program provides grants and related assistance to AANAPISIs to enable such institutions to improve and expand their capacity to serve Asian Americans and Native American Pacific Islanders and low-income individuals. The Department awarded more than $23 million to six states through the GEAR UP state grant program. This discretionary grant program is designed to increase the number of students with low incomes who are prepared to enter and succeed in postsecondary education. The Department also awarded more than $46 million to 107 institutions under the Strengthening Institutions Program (SIP), a program designed to help eligible institutions expand their capacity to serve students with low incomes by providing funds to improve and The CCAMPIS awardees are listed below: State Institution Award Amount AL Jacksonville State University $376,110.00 AL Troy University $500,000.00 CA Cal State LA University Auxiliary Services, Inc. $450,000.00 CA Chabot-Las Positas Community College District-Chabot College $500,000.00 CA Fresno City College $500,000.00 CA Kern Community College District - for Bakersfield College $500,000.00 CA Lake Tahoe Community College District $330,597.00 CA Merced Community College District $500,000.00 CA Sonoma County Junior College District $250,000.00 CA The Regents of the Univ. of Calif., U.C.

12-Oct-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-educations-office-civil-rights-resolves-restraint-and-seclusion-compliance-review-folsom-cordova-unified-school-district-california,U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights Resolves Restraint and Seclusion Compliance Review of Folsom Cordova Unified School District in California,"Today, the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) announced that it has resolved a compliance review of the Folsom Cordova Unified School District in California to ensure that the district’s restraint and seclusion policies and practices do not deny students with disabilities their civil rights in violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504), Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, and their implementing regulations. OCR’s investigation revealed that overall, the district infrequently held Individualized Education Program (IEP) meetings for students with disabilities after they were restrained or secluded, even in extreme situations, such as for a student who experienced 22 restraints at a district school in one year. In another situation, OCR found that a student spent over 38 hours in a “Refocus Room” of a nonpublic school (NPS) in one school year and was subjected to a prone restraint, but the district did not convene the student’s IEP team until the end of the school year. OCR also identified a compliance concern that the district may have failed to implement the IEPs and Behavior Intervention Plans (BIPs) for some students and thereby denied those students their right to a free appropriate public education (FAPE). OCR identified a recordkeeping concern because the IEP and BIPs for students placed in time away did not consistently address whether and how time away should be used, and other records were not always complete or accurate. The district agreed to resolve these violations and compliance concerns by making significant changes to its policies, procedures, and training requirements with respect to the use of restraint and seclusion. The district also agreed to remedy prior instances where restraint and seclusion of its students denied or may have denied them a FAPE, and to develop a monitoring program to ensure that any future restraint or seclusion complies with Section 504 and Title II. “Folsom Cordova Unified School District updated its policies and practices during the course of our investigation and has now agreed to take important steps to ensure full civil rights protection for its students with disabilities with respect to restraint or seclusion in both district schools and nonpublic school settings,” said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon. The steps the district committed to take in the resolution agreement include: Revising and distributing to district staff and NPS employees its policies, procedures, and forms for restraint and seclusion. Ensuring a process to create and maintain records about its use of restraint and seclusion. Providing training on the revised policies and Section 504 FAPE requirements to teachers, administrators, and other members of IEP and Section 504 teams. Ensuring that NPS staff serving district students are trained on the revised policies. Providing individual remedies for students who experienced restraint or seclusion during the review period by convening their IEP or Section 504 team to determine if compensatory services are needed, and if so, by timely providing such services. Conducting a review to determine whether any other district students were denied a FAPE due to the district’s or an NPS’s use of restraint or seclusion from 2019 to the present, and to implement responsive remedies based on this review. And, Implementing a program to monitor the use of restraint and seclusion with students in district schools and NPSs to safeguard their rights under Section 504 and Title II. During the investigation, the district had already taken other steps to improve its compliance, including modifying its process for reviewing behavior emergencies and rewriting its master agreement with NPSs with whom it contracts.

This investment builds on the U.S. Department of Education’s (Department) “ Raising the Bar for Parent Partnership in Our Schools ” efforts to engage parents, family members, caregivers, or advocates. To date, the current program has awarded nearly $83 million to expand and support parent and family engagement. “As a parent, teacher, and former principal, I’ve seen firsthand how strong and productive relationships between educators and families are the foundation of thriving school communities,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “The importance of parent partnerships in our schools is backed by years of research demonstrating how students benefit academically, socially, and emotionally from robust family engagement. The grants announced by the Biden-Harris Administration today will help schools across the country Raise the Bar for how they engage parents, families, and caregivers, and ultimately, how they drive student success.” The Statewide Family Engagement Centers (SFEC) program provides financial support to statewide organizations to carry out parent education and family engagement programs. In addition, the program provides technical assistance and support to state educational agencies (SEAs) and local educational agencies (LEAs) in the implementation and enhancement of systemic and effective family engagement policies, programs, and activities that lead to improvements in student development and academic achievement. Services offered through SFEC are designed to assist parents in participating in their children’s education, including by giving parents more confidence and empowering them to engage with teachers and school leaders. The SFEC program, housed within the Department’s Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, has supported funding efforts to: Provide direct services to families on how to effectively work with their child’s school and teachers to improve their child’s academic outcomes and overall well-being. Serve as critical centralized information hubs during and after the pandemic. Launch strategic surveys and publish key research findings to inform educators, practitioners, and families about the latest educational barriers and opportunities. Provide parents and caregivers with easy-to-understand, applicable information to solve present-day problems. During the Department’s recent “Back to School Bus Tour 2023: Raise the Bar,” Secretary Cardona and senior officials listened to parents’ input across the country and discussed how engagement in their children’s education can strongly enhance academic outcomes and contribute to better social-emotional outcomes. For example, during the Kansas City, Missouri stop , the Secretary met with parents to share the Biden-Harris Administration ’s efforts around parental engagement and to discuss the importance of and value in bringing their voices to the table in schools—regardless of their ethnic background or socio-economic status. Also, this summer, the Department completed a six-part Family Engagement Learning Series and hosted a series of Parent Empowerment Pop-Ups . On National Parents Day, the Department published a parent-written blog titled “ Standing Shoulder-to-Shoulder, ” and Secretary Cardona participated in a cookout in Chicago with parents . The Department has also hosted the National Center on Safe Supportive Learning Environments’ webinar on Strategies for Engaging Families to Support Students’ Social, Emotional, Behavioral, and Academic Well-Being and Success, as well as an Engage Every Student webinar on Parent and Family Engagement with out-of-school time practitioners.

These centers further the Department's commitment to accelerate learning, meet students' mental health needs, and expand academic opportunity and success inside and outside of the regular school day. ""To Raise the Bar in education, we must equip schools and districts with strategies backed by decades of experience and research to support students' wellbeing and drive academic success,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""Today, we are announcing new technical assistance opportunities that will help education leaders to hone their statewide literacy plans, respond to individual student's needs and civil rights, and provide enriching out-of-school-time programs. Raising the Bar is about embracing what works so that students can thrive in the classroom and beyond."" The Department is announcing the awarding of funds for technical assistance centers that will support the Department's Raise the Bar: Lead the World initiative and build on announcements the Department made earlier in the year to accelerate learning and improve student achievement: Comprehensive Literacy State Development Center ($760,619) Beginning in November 2023, the Department will make the Comprehensive Literacy State Development (CLSD) Center available to expand support to state educational agencies (SEAs) that do not currently receive a CLSD grant. The center will help SEAs to revise, enhance, or create State Literacy Plans and support states, school districts, and communities in promoting equitable access to high quality literacy instruction and materials for every student. National Technical Assistance Center for 21st Century Community Learning Centers ($18.3 Million) The Nita M. Lowey 21st Century Community Learning Centers (21st CCLC) program provides essential out-of-school learning opportunities that help accelerate academic recovery and supports students' social, emotional, and mental health. Out-of-school time opportunities are especially critical as students continue to recover from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. To support high-quality out-of-school learning time, the National Technical Assistance Center under the 21st CCLC program assists SEAs and their grantees that operate 21st CCLC programs in providing academic supports and other enrichment opportunities for students, and especially underserved students, during non-school hours. This technical assistance center will focus on students' academic and mental health needs in alignment with the traditional school day; academic recovery; science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) activities; improving attendance and student engagement of middle and high school students; supporting multilingual learners; and financial literacy, among other technical assistance opportunities. Student Support and Academic Enrichment (Title IV, Part A) and Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA) Stronger Connections Technical Assistance Center (T4PA) ($5.6 Million) A comprehensive education that provides students with well-rounded learning opportunities across subject areas in a safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment is key to student success. The T4PA/BSCA Center provides high-quality technical assistance, training, and support to SEAs to increase their capacity to assist local educational agencies (LEAs) in implementing the Title IV, Part A program's focus on student safety and well-being. This is the first time the center has received an award since the passage of BSCA, which provided $1 billion in new resources to support positive and safe learning environments. The Center supports students' academic achievement by enhancing state and community capacity to: (1) provide all students with access to a well-rounded education, (2) enhance safe and positive school conditions for student learning, and (3) foster the responsible use of technology to improve the academic achievement and digital literacy of all students. In addition, the Center will provide technical assistance and capacity-building support to BSCA Stronger Connections grantees, all of which are high-need LEAs, as defined by states. The LEAs that received Stronger Connections Grants will be working to create positive and safe learning environments. The center will also provide targeted technical assistance to states, conduct needs assessments, develop customized training and resources, and convene communities of practice."

The Nation's Report Card , also known as the National Assessment of Educational Progress, or NAEP, is the only nationally representative assessment of student achievement. Over the past year, NAEP provided critical insights into student learning gaps across subjects and grades worsened by the pandemic. In addition, accompanying survey data revealed important trends related to chronic absenteeism, literacy, and teacher confidence in getting students back on track. The nonpartisan 26-member governing board was established by Congress to set policy for the Nation's Report Card. The board decides what grades and subjects to assess, content to include, and achievement levels. It works with the National Center for Education Statistics, which administers NAEP, to release and disseminate results. ""As we work to Raise the Bar for academic excellence and promote the benefits of evidence-based strategies to support learning recovery in our schools, the Nation's Report Card shines a much-needed light on students' progress,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""I'm confident the appointees announced today will draw on their diverse experiences - including as school leaders, educators, and parents - to guide decision-making around how we assess student achievement in our country. At this critical moment in our students' continued recovery from the disruption of the pandemic, I'm especially grateful for these leaders and their willingness to serve on the National Assessment Governing Board.""

4-Oct-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-announces-additional-9-billion-student-debt-relief,Biden-Harris Administration Announces an Additional $9 Billion in Student Debt Relief,"The Biden-Harris administration announced today that an additional 125,000 Americans have been approved for $9 billion in debt relief through fixes the U.S. Department of Education has made to income-driven repayment (IDR) and Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF), and granting automatic relief for borrowers with total and permanent disabilities. Today's announcement brings the total approved debt cancellation by the Biden-Harris Administration to $127 billion for nearly 3.6 million Americans. The Biden-Harris Administration is announcing it has approved: $5.2 billion in additional debt relief for 53,000 borrowers under Public Service Loan Forgiveness programs. Nearly $2.8 billion in new debt relief for nearly 51,000 borrowers through fixes to income-driven repayment plans. These are borrowers who have been in repayment for 20 or more years but never got the relief they were entitled to $1.2 billion for nearly 22,000 borrowers who have a total or permanent disability and have been identified and approved for discharge through a data match with the Social Security Administration. ""For years, millions of eligible borrowers were unable to access the student debt relief they qualified for, but that's all changed thanks to President Biden and this Administration's relentless efforts to fix the broken student loan system,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""The Biden-Harris administration's laser-like focus on reducing red tape, addressing past administrative failures, and putting borrowers first have now resulted in a historic $127 billion in debt relief approved for nearly 3.6 million borrowers. Today's announcement builds on everything our administration has already done to protect students from unaffordable debt, make repayment more affordable, and ensure that investments in higher education pay off for students and working families."" The Biden-Harris administration has taken historic steps to reduce the burden of student debt and ensure that student loans are not a barrier to opportunity for students and families. The Administration earlier this year launched the most affordable student loan repayment plan – SAVE – which makes many borrowers' monthly payments as low as $0 and prevents balances from growing because of unpaid interest. The Administration secured the largest increase to Pell Grants in a decade, and finalized new rules to protect borrowers from career programs that leave graduates with unaffordable debts or insufficient earnings. And, in the wake of the Supreme Court decision on the Administration's original student debt relief plan, President Biden announced his Administration was pursuing an alternative path to debt relief through negotiated rulemaking under the Higher Education Act. The Department of Education took an important step forward in the negotiated rulemaking last week – announcing individuals who will serve on the negotiating committee and releasing an issue paper to guide the first negotiating session. The paper asks the committee to consider how the Administration can help borrowers, including borrowers whose balances are greater than what they originally borrowed, who would be eligible for relief under existing repayment plans but have not applied, and who have experienced financial hardship on their loans that the current loan system doesn't address. To date, the Biden-Harris Administration has approved the following in debt cancellation: Nearly $42 billion for almost 855,000 borrowers who are eligible for forgiveness through income-driven repayment by fixing historical inaccuracies in the count of payments that qualify toward forgiveness; Almost $51 billion for 715,000 public servants through Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) programs, including the limited PSLF waiver and Temporary Expanded PSLF (TEPSLF); $11.7 billion for almost 513,000 borrowers with a total and permanent disability; an $22.5 billion for more than 1.3 million borrowers who were cheated by their schools, saw their institutions precipitously close, or are covered by related court settlements.

The U.S. Department of Education (Department) today released an issue paper laying out its initial set of policy considerations to create a path to debt relief for student loan borrowers in need. The paper identifies five questions about distinct categories of affected borrowers for which the Department is seeking feedback. This includes questions about borrowers whose balances are greater than what they originally borrowed, whose loans first entered repayment decades ago, who attended programs that did not provide sufficient financial value, who are eligible for relief under programs like income-driven repayment but have not applied, and borrowers who have experienced financial hardship and need support, but for whom the current student loan system does not adequately address. “The Biden-Harris Administration has taken unprecedented action to fix the broken student loan system and deliver record amounts of student debt relief,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “Now, we are diligently moving through the regulatory process to advance debt relief for even more borrowers. Today, after considering more than 26,000 public comments on how to tailor this relief, we are releasing this additional information about this effort. We’re committed to standing up for borrowers and making sure that student debt does not stop anyone from climbing the economic ladder and pursuing the American dream.” The debt relief issue paper will be discussed at the first meeting of the Student Loan Relief Committee, which is scheduled to take place October 10 and 11. The committee will be comprised of non-federal negotiators from 14 affected constituency groups, as well as a negotiator from the Department. During the session, the non-federal negotiators will provide input on the policy considerations and questions outlined by the Department, as well as identify any new proposals they may have. Members of the public will also have an opportunity to provide comments at the end of each day. Through this process, the Department will continue to develop regulatory text for consideration. The committee is also scheduled to meet in November and December. The public will have an opportunity to submit written comments on the draft rules when they are published next year. The Department is also releasing a list of the individuals who will serve on the negotiating committee, which can be found here . These individuals were chosen based upon review of the nominations received in response to the Department’s request for nominations. We are still looking for individuals who can serve as alternate negotiators for two constituencies: (1) state officials, including state higher education executive officers, state authorizing agencies, and state regulators of institutions of higher education and (2) Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal Colleges and Universities, and Minority-Serving Institutions (institutions of higher education eligible to receive federal assistance under Title III, Parts A and F, and Title V of the Higher Education Act of 1965). Individuals who wish to represent these constituencies or organizations that wish to nominate someone for these constituencies should email negregnominations@ed.gov before October 6. Submissions should include the information originally requested for nominees, which can be found here . This includes contact information, evidence of expertise, and a resume. From these submissions, the Department will make a selection for the unfilled alternate negotiator positions and ask the committee for its consensus approval during its first meeting. Updates on the student debt relief rulemaking process will be posted here . Members of the public who wish to view the sessions or provide public testimony can also find a link on that page closer to the committee’s meetings where they can register to do so. Continuing to provide debt relief and support borrowers Today’s announcement builds on the work the Biden-Harris Administration has already done to improve the student loan program and make higher education more affordable. This includes approving $117 billion in relief for more than 3.4 million borrowers, including: $39 billion for 804,000 borrowers who are eligible for forgiveness through Income-Driven Repayment by fixing historical inaccuracies in the count of payments that qualify toward forgiveness. $45.7 billion for 662,000 public servants through Public Service Loan Forgiveness programs. $10.5 billion for almost 491,000 borrowers with a total and permanent disability; and $22 billion for nearly 1.3 million borrowers who were cheated by their schools, saw their institutions precipitously close, or are covered by related court settlements. The Biden-Harris Administration remains committed to making college more affordable and ensuring student debt is not a roadblock to attaining a college degree or credential or planning for the future. The Administration launched the most affordable student loan repayment plan ever – the SAVE Plan – earlier this year, has made the largest increase to Pell Grants in a decade, and has charted a course to double the maximum Pell Grant and make community college free to enhance college affordability and reduce unnecessary student debt. The Administration is also holding institutions accountable for unaffordable debts and recently proposed regulations that would set standards for earnings and debt outcomes for career programs while enhancing transparency for all programs to give students the information they need to make informed choices."
29-Sep-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-highlights-record-championing-historically-black-colleges-and-universities-hbcus,FACT SHEET: Biden-Harris Administration Highlights A Record of Championing Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs),"In his Executive Order reestablishing the White House Initiative (Initiative) on Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), President Joe Biden charged the Initiative to, “develop new and expand pre-existing national networks of individuals, organizations, and communities to share and implement administrative and programmatic best practices related to advancing educational equity, excellence, and opportunity at HBCUs.” This week, the Initiative hosted the annual National HBCU Week Conference , the nation’s premier convening of HBCU leaders. The event provides a unique occasion for over 2,300 registered representatives from HBCUs, federal agencies, private-sector companies, philanthropic organizations, and others to discuss opportunities to advance educational equity, improve instruction, support degree completion, and deepen federal engagement—all of which strengthen the role of HBCUs. The achievements of HBCU graduates speak to the value of these institutions, which foster academic excellence and emphasize campus cultures grounded in community and inclusion. Despite representing only 3% of colleges and universities, HBCU graduates play an outsized role to support the economic mobility of African Americans, producing: 40 percent of all Black engineers 50 percent of all Black teachers 70 percent of all Black doctors and dentists 80 percent of all Black judges The first woman and Black and South Asian Vice President of the United States For more than 180 years, HBCUs have raised the bar for equity, access, and excellence, creating doors of opportunity for Black students where none previously existed. The Biden-Harris Administration views HBCUs as central to our vision of a more inclusive, equitable, and valuable higher education system. The Biden-Harris Administration has taken historic actions to support HBCUs, including by: Investing over $7 billion in HBCUs, which includes: $3.6 billion for HBCUs through the American Rescue Plan and other COVID relief. $1.6 billion in capital finance debt relief for 45 public and private HBCUs. $1.7 billion in grant funding to expand academic capacity and provide support for low-income students. Supporting HBCUs, the students they enroll, and a diverse teacher workforce in the 2022 and 2023 spending packages, which include securing: New flexibilities for minority-serving institutions to use Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund dollars to invest in renovations, construction, and other infrastructure needs related to the pandemic; A combined $900 increase to Pell Grants—the largest increase in a decade—bringing the maximum award to $7,395, which is critical to the approximately 75 percent of HBCU students who rely on Pell Grants to afford college; A new $50 million grant program focused on supporting research and development infrastructure and capacity for HBCUs, Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), and MSIs; A $758 million investment for HBCU institutional development; and First-time grants for the Augustus Hawkins Centers of Excellence to strengthen and diversify the teaching profession to help close opportunity gaps, including $1.56 million going to an HBCU. Drawing attention to funding inequities for 1890 land-grant institutions. U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona and U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Thomas Vilsack sent letters to 16 governors emphasizing the over $12 billion disparity in funding between land-grant HBCUs and their non-HBCU land-grant peers in their states that occurred between 1987 and 2020. This disparity has: Forced many HBCUs to operate with inadequate resources and delay investments in campus infrastructure, student supports, research development, and more; Resulted in states failing to live up to their legal obligations to provide equitable funding to HBCUs, resulting in funding gaps from $172 million to $2.1 billion; and Reinforced the importance of equitably funding HBCUs and the talented, diverse students and communities they serve so they may reach their full potential and continue driving innovation. Supporting HBCUs facing violence: The U.S. Department of Education ensured HBCUs affected by more than a dozen bomb threats in 2022 were able to secure over $2.4 million in Project SERV funds— grants to help schools and colleges recover from a violent or traumatic event. The Department worked with HBCUs and across the federal government to: Direct Project SERV funds help restore safe learning environments and invest in mental health for students; and Develop a compendium of federal programs to help institutions responding to bomb threats. The U.S. Department of Education is proud to be a part of a whole-of-government approach to pioneering brand new programs in support of HBCUs, including: U.S. Air Force’s first-ever HBCU-led University Affiliated Research Center (UARC), led by Howard University with 7 other HBCUs and funded at $90 million over five years. Department of Commerce’s first-ever Connecting-Minority-Communities program delivering funding for 43 HBCUs to purchase broadband internet, equipment, and IT personnel. Department of Transportation announced Prairie View A&M University in Texas as the first-ever HBCU to lead a University Transportation Center . Prairie View A&M, with 11 other HBCUs, were among 34 schools to receive a portion of a $435 million grant for development of interoperable technology systems. Department of Energy’s first-ever Funding for Accelerated, Inclusive Research (FAIR) Program providing over $35 million to build research capacity, infrastructure, and expertise at institutions historically excluded from federal research and development. National Science Foundation’s new efforts to break down barriers in STEM such as: The Growing Research Access for Nationally Transformative Equity and Diversity (GRANTED) program to encourage transformative ideas and scalable models to break down barriers to federal grants and other resources for emerging research and minority-serving institutions; and NASA’s new pioneering efforts to close opportunity gaps in STEM, including nearly $12 million for eight HBCUs to support programs in artificial intelligence and machine learning and create a more diverse pipeline of talent for “data-intensive space-based Earth sciences” careers."
28-Sep-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-outlines-strategies-increase-diversity-and-opportunity-higher-education,Biden-Harris Administration Outlines Strategies to Increase Diversity and Opportunity in Higher Education,"As part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s ongoing commitment to advance diversity and opportunity in higher education, the U.S. Department of Education today released a report , “Strategies for Increasing Diversity and Opportunity in Higher Education,” that calls on states and higher education leaders to prioritize efforts that advance diversity on college campuses. The report outlines evidence-based strategies and practices in the areas of outreach, admissions, financial aid, and college completion. And it answers President Biden’s charge to the Department to elevate promising practices to build inclusive, diverse student bodies in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision in Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President and Fellows of Harvard College and Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. University of North Carolina et al. (collectively “ SFFA ”). “One of the cruelest ironies in America’s current higher education system is that our most inclusive and accessible institutions have lacked adequate resources to invest in student success, while highly selective institutions with vast resources to invest in students and propel them to graduation day admit overwhelmingly affluent applicants with a myriad of advantages,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “This report reflects President Biden and Vice President Harris’ unyielding commitment to equal opportunity and provides colleges and universities with a roadmap for advancing student body diversity. This moment demands leadership, innovation, and collaboration from leaders at every level to break down barriers for underserved students and reimagine pathways into higher education. Our future is brighter when we prepare students of all backgrounds to lead our multiracial democracy together.” The Administration encourages institutions of higher education and state leaders to use this resource to consider the ways in which they can expand access to educational opportunity for all. The report provides evidence for steps leaders can take to enhance socioeconomic and racial diversity in colleges, including: Investing in targeted recruitment, outreach, and pathway programs, including with K–12 schools, community colleges, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institutions, Tribal Colleges and Universities, and Minority-Serving Institutions, including Hispanic Serving Institutions; Giving meaningful consideration in admissions to the adversity students have faced, including a students’ financial means, where a student grew up or attended high school, and personal experiences of hardship and discrimination, including racial discrimination, and ending practices that hinder socioeconomic and racial diversity; Increasing affordability, including through need-based aid, and ensuring transparency and simplicity in student aid application processes; and Cultivating welcoming and supportive environments for students and providing comprehensive support programs that increase retention and completion rates. This new report is one of several swift actions taken by the Biden-Harris Administration to respond to the Court’s decision in SFFA . Following the Court’s decision President Biden and Vice President Harris called on colleges, universities, and other stakeholders to seize the opportunity to expand access to educational opportunity for all students, and to build diverse student bodies, including by recognizing and valuing students who have overcome adversity. The Administration remains committed to advancing access to education for all Americans and to promoting diversity in higher education consistent with the law. The Administration has taken steps to support our Nation's colleges and universities so they can continue building pathways to upward mobility and preparing students from all backgrounds to thrive in our workforce. “Our country’s greatest strength is the diversity of our people,” said Under Secretary James Kvaal. “That’s why we’re calling upon state, college, and university leaders to renew their commitments to opportunity for all students. Moving forward, we will work with institutions and leaders across the country to ensure we can continue to make progress in closing equity gaps in higher education so that all students can reap the benefits of college degrees and credentials.” Diverse college campuses can provide experiences that increase critical thinking, civic engagement, leadership skills, and cross-racial interaction for all students, and they allow students from all backgrounds the chance to pursue and achieve the benefits of postsecondary education, such as economic and social mobility. Having a college experience that is enhanced by a diverse learning environment ensures that students are able to thrive and compete in today’s global economy. Further, higher education continues to be one of the strongest paths for people to secure economic mobility. Yet, persistent socioeconomic and racial gaps remain in higher education access. Students of color and lower income students are less likely to apply, be admitted, and complete their programs. This is particularly true at highly-selective institutions, which have vast resources and provide their students with substantial advantages and can propel them to a promising future. In producing this report, the Department considered peer-reviewed research on efforts undertaken by institutions, states, and non-profit organizations, as well as examples of promising efforts underway at institutions. Higher education leaders can use this evidence as they review their admissions policies and consider other strategies to ensure their campuses are diverse and welcoming to all students. Following the SFFA decision, the Department and the U.S. Department of Justice issued a Dear Colleague Letter and a Questions and Answers resource that distills the Court’s core holding and offers examples of steps colleges and universities can lawfully take to achieve a student body that is diverse across a range of factors, including race and ethnicity. As part of these continued efforts, the Department will consider ways to collect and publish additional information on college applications and enrollment trends, including how these data can be disaggregated by race and ethnicity, first-generation status, legacy status, and other important measures. The Department will also begin to assist states, territories, and Tribal Nations with using their data to improve college recruitment, admissions, and financial aid practices. This work builds upon the historic efforts of the Biden-Harris Administration to ensure all students have the opportunity to access higher education, including securing a historic increase in the Pell Grant, fixing the broken student loan system, and supporting HBCUs, MSIs, and community colleges. More information on the work the Biden-Harris Administration is doing to continue building success for all students to thrive can be found here."
27-Sep-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-announces-landmark-final-rules-protect-consumers-unaffordable-student-debt-and-increase-transparency,Biden-Harris Administration Announces Landmark Final Rules to Protect Consumers from Unaffordable Student Debt and Increase Transparency,"The Biden-Harris Administration today released final regulations that establish the most effective set of safeguards ever against unaffordable debt or insufficient earnings for postsecondary students. The final rule has two key parts: A revitalized and strengthened Gainful Employment (GE) rule, that will protect approximately 700,000 students a year from career training programs that leave graduates with unaffordable loan payments or earnings no better than what someone who did not pursue postsecondary education earns in their state. A new Financial Value Transparency (FVT) framework will give students in all programs the most detailed information ever available about the net costs of postsecondary programs, and the financial outcomes they can expect. It will also help prospective students understand the potential risks involved in their program choices by requiring them to acknowledge viewing this information before enrolling in certificate or graduate programs whose graduates have been determined to face unaffordable debt levels. “Today’s final rules answer President Biden’s call to hold colleges accountable for rising costs and protect students from unaffordable college debt,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “We are fixing a broken system and making sure that students know, before they take out loans, when college programs have a history of leaving graduates with high debts, low earnings, and poor career prospects. The Biden-Harris administration believes that when students invest in higher education, they should get a solid return on their investment and a greater shot at the American dream.” The Department estimates that the final rules will protect nearly 700,000 students annually who would otherwise enroll in one of nearly 1,700 low-performing programs. Not counting students already covered by the GE accountability provisions, the FVT framework would result in acknowledgments for an estimated 400 graduate programs that enroll about 120,000 students. “These protections are about ensuring career college programs live up to higher education’s promise as a pathway to a better a life,” said U.S. Department of Education Under Secretary James Kvaal. “Students overwhelmingly say that they’re going to college to find a good job and build financial security, but too often their programs leave them no better off financially than those with no postsecondary education at all. These rules will stop taxpayer dollars from going to schools that continually saddle students with unaffordable debt. Separately, we’re ensuring all students have increased information to make good choices.” These final regulations are part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s work to ensure that postsecondary education remains an engine for equal opportunity, upward mobility, and global competitiveness. The Administration has already approved more than $117 billion in student loan forgiveness for over 3.4 million borrowers. The Biden-Harris Administration has also championed the largest increase to Pell Grants in a decade and is fighting to put the grant on a path to doubling the maximum award by 2029. President Biden will also continue to fight for tuition-free community college and tuition assistance at Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal Colleges and Universities, and Minority-Serving Institutions. Gainful Employment Program Accountability Framework Under the final rule, the Department assesses whether programs offered by private for-profit institutions and certificate programs at all types of colleges meet the statutory requirement to prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation using two separate measures. Specifically: The share of annual earnings the typical graduate needs to devote to paying their debt (i.e., their “debt-to-earnings ratio”) must be less than or equal to 8 percent, or less than or equal to 20 percent of their discretionary earnings (defined as their annual earnings minus 150 percent of the federal poverty guideline).This metric captures whether a program’s debt is affordable. At least half of graduates have higher earnings than a typical high school graduate in their state’s labor force who never enrolled in postsecondary education. This ""earnings premium"" assesses whether the program enhances its students’ earnings potential. Programs will be assessed separately on each metric. Programs that fail either will need to warn students that the program is at risk of losing access to the federal student aid programs. Those that fail to meet the standards on the same metric twice in a three-year period will not be eligible to participate in the Department's Federal student aid programs. Financial Value Transparency for All Students and Families The final rules also include the FVT framework. It will provide students and families across the country with the most detailed information ever available about what they are likely to pay out-of-pocket for programs, how much debt they can expect to take on, and how much money students are likely to earn after graduation. The FVT framework also includes provisions to ensure prospective students are aware, before they enroll, of risks associated with selecting a certificate or graduate program that is likely to leave them with unaffordable debt. Students will receive this enhanced transparency for programs through new reporting requirements for institutions related to costs (including tuition and fees, books, and supplies), non-federal grant aid, and typical borrowing amounts (for both private and federal loans). The Department will also calculate typical earnings for program graduates. This information will be made publicly available to students on a website run by the Department. The Department focused the FVT acknowledgements on certificate and graduate programs in the final rule because they are the programs where unaffordable debt is most common, and students tend to enroll directly into particular programs. By contrast, many students seeking undergraduate degrees do not select a program when they enter the institution. The Department issued these final rules after careful consideration of more than 7,500 public comments received over the summer. The GE accountability and FVT reporting provisions will go into effect on July 1, 2024. The first official financial outcome rates will be published in early 2025. Programs that fail the same GE metric in the first two years the rates are issued will become ineligible in 2026. The final regulations will be on public inspection in the Federal Register tomorrow and published on October 10, 2023. An official copy of the regulations can be found here . A fact sheet on the final rule can be found here . The Department released comprehensive data on the estimated effects of the rule on most specific postsecondary programs in May. Those data can be found here , along with a description of the data , and a data codebook ."

OSEP’s Personnel Development Program, authorized by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) Part D, funds activities that recruit, prepare, and retain personnel who serve and support infants, toddlers, children, and youth with disabilities and their families. Personnel include early intervention providers; teachers; related services providers; administrators leading early intervention programs, schools, or local and state agencies; and university faculty who are preparing future generations of personnel to serve children with disabilities. “Investing in the preparation and professional development of a strong, diverse workforce to serve children with disabilities is critical, not only to the well-being of individuals with disabilities, but to improve outcomes for all children. Special educators, early intervention providers, and related services providers are essential professionals in our schools, early childhood programs, and communities, but far too many states are struggling to hire qualified personnel in these roles,” said Glenna Wright-Gallo, assistant secretary for the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services. “The Department is working to Raise the Bar by improving learning conditions for all children through uplifting the teaching profession and eliminating personnel shortages . OSEP’s Personnel Development Program grants play a key role in meeting this challenge by helping develop well trained, fully credentialed personnel who have the necessary skills and knowledge to successfully serve children with disabilities and their families.” Data released in 2022 from the National Center for Education Statistics revealed 45% of U.S. public schools operated without a full teaching staff in October 2022, and special education teaching positions had the highest vacancy rates. The 126 personnel preparation grants awarded require universities to use at least 65% of the federal funds for “scholar support,” which includes scholarships, tuition and fees, or other support to cover the costs required to complete the preparation program. Additionally, 11 awards support personnel development through preservice program improvement grants, and one award funds a new national center to support school and early intervention program administrators to effectively implement the IDEA and improve systems serving children with disabilities. Federal funds are awarded annually to support five-year grant projects.

22-Sep-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-announces-new-supports-increase-reach-mental-health-services-and-professionals-schools,Biden-Harris Administration Announces New Supports to Increase Reach of Mental Health Services and Professionals in Schools,"The Biden-Harris Administration today is announcing a $2.6 million award to support mental health services and professionals in schools, further delivering on a key priority of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA). The Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System will establish a national Mental Health Evaluation, Training, Research, and Innovation Center for Schools (METRICS) to increase support and offer new resources for schools nationwide on training mental health professionals and providing school-based mental health services. This award is made possible by the historic Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which President Biden signed into law on June 25, 2022. Over the next five years, BSCA will invest over $1 billion in school-based mental health programs, making substantial progress towards the President's goal, as part of his Mental Health Strategy , to double the number of school counselors, social workers, and other mental health professionals available to support students' mental health needs. Research shows the shortage among mental health professionals is a primary reason students lack access to the mental health services they need. This center will help close this gap by providing schools with the tools they need to strengthen the pipeline of high-quality mental health professionals and increasing access to critical mental health services in high-need schools. These funds have the potential to meaningfully change lives by building a mental health infrastructure in schools and communities across the country. ""The youth mental health crisis continues to be among the top concerns raised to me by the students, parents, families, educators, and school leaders I've visited in 43 states across America,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""Thanks to President Biden's leadership in securing the resources of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, we are making unprecedented investments in mental health that will help states, districts, and schools Raise the Bar for students' overall well-being and academic recovery. This new nationwide technical assistance center, run by the University of Wisconsin system, is an exciting step forward that will help equip education leaders with the most effective strategies for integrating mental health services in their schools."" The new METRICS Center will support grantees of the U.S. Department of Education's (Department) two programs for increasing the number of mental health providers in schools—School-Based Mental Health (SBMH) and Mental Health Services Professionals (MHSP). METRICS will also distribute resources to states, districts, and schools nationwide to help them implement high-quality projects to address the social, emotional, and mental health needs of PK-12 students and increase the number of school-based mental health services providers. The Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System, in partnership with the University of South Florida, School Mental Health Collaborative; the University of Iowa, Scanlan Center for School Mental Health; and University of California, Santa Barbara's International Center for School-Based Youth Development, which is an Hispanic Serving Institution, will support the 264 new MHSP and SBMH grantees and disseminate resources and information to state educational agencies (SEAs), local educational agencies (LEAs), institutions of higher education (IHEs), and other stakeholders through METRICS. This new resource is critical to increasing the numbers of providers and skills of the existing workforce, in a time when the health and well-being of our nation's children and youth has been challenged by the COVID-19 pandemic, which exacerbated pre-existing inequities. The Department has made increasing access to mental health care a key focus area of the Raise the Bar: Lead the World initiative because it is critical that every student has access to the support they need. In addition, research shows that students are more likely to seek and sustain mental health care when those services are available at school. Expanding access and integrating mental health services into our nation's schools is also a key component of President Biden's Mental Health Strategy. Since day one, the Biden-Harris Administration has committed to taking a whole of government approach to enhancing mental health services for young people.

21-Sep-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-educations-office-civil-rights-announces-resolution-disability-harassment-investigation-allegheny-valley-school-district-pennsylvania,U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights Announces Resolution of Disability Harassment Investigation of Allegheny Valley School District in Pennsylvania,"The U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) resolved today a disability harassment investigation of the Allegheny Valley School District in Pennsylvania. OCR determined that the district subjected a student with a disability to harassment so pervasive that it constituted a hostile environment and that the district failed to take necessary steps to protect the student, end the harassment, and assess whether the harassment impeded the student’s ability to access the district’s educational program, in violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504), Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (Title II), and their implementing regulations. Over a period of six months, classmates repeatedly directed disability slurs at the student and both physically attacked the student and threatened to attack him in a manner directly related to his disability, all of which the student’s parent, and school staff, reported to a district principal. One of the attacks was captured on school security camera video and still the principal did not treat it as disability-based harassment. OCR’s investigation revealed that the district did not investigate all incidents reported, and where the district investigated, its investigations were so limited that they, for example, disregarded an eyewitness report and did not seek information from relevant witnesses. Further, OCR’s investigation revealed that the district treated each report of harassment as an isolated incident, instead of an accumulation of evidence that the student was experiencing persistent disability-related harassment. Although OCR’s investigation revealed that the student’s parent reported that the harassing behavior was impacting the student’s ability to access the district’s educational program, and requested modifications to the student’s individualized education plan (IEP) to provide the student with more support, the district failed to convene a formal IEP meeting, pursuant to the requirements of Section 504, for more than six months after the student’s parent first reported the harassment. And even when the district convened the student’s IEP team six months later, there is no evidence that the IEP team considered whether the harassment resulted in a denial of a free appropriate public education (FAPE) for the student, and whether adjustments to the student’s IEP were necessary. “No student should endure the disability-based hostile environment that the student in this investigation suffered, and our federal civil rights laws promise that schools will take necessary steps to protect students from these harms,” said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon. “Allegheny Valley School District has now committed to important corrective action so no student in its charge will live through the harm the student in this investigation suffered, and instead every student may expect to experience the nondiscriminatory learning environment that federal law guarantees.” The resolution agreement commits the district to take steps to ensure nondiscrimination based on disability in all of its education programs and activities, including: The distribution of a memorandum to all district staff affirming the district’s obligations pursuant to Section 504 and Title II. Training all school staff. Offering individual remedies to the student, such as counseling, academic or other therapeutic services to remedy the effects of the harassment. Convening the student’s IEP team, as appropriate, to determine whether he experienced a FAPE impact due to the harassment. A review of all bullying incidents for a three-year period at the school to determine any needed additional remedies. And, A climate assessment to evaluate needed additional supports to ensure a nondiscriminatory school environment for students.

21-Sep-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-educations-office-civil-rights-resolves-sexual-harassment-compliance-review-alpine-school-district-utah,U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights Resolves Sexual Harassment Compliance Review of Alpine School District in Utah,"The U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) announced today that the Alpine School District in Utah has entered into a resolution agreement to ensure the district’s compliance with Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 when responding to notice of sexual harassment of its students by other students and employees. OCR determined that the district discriminated against students based on sex by failing to respond to reports of sexual assault by employees and students or to coordinate its responses to such reports through its Title IX coordinators, among other Title IX violations. In particular, OCR found that the district failed to investigate or redress employee-to-student and student-to-student sexual assault allegations after they were reported to law enforcement, leaving affected students vulnerable to the discrimination that Title IX prohibits but that law enforcement does not address. Likewise the district did not complete or take required investigative steps in other reported employee-to-student cases and most reported student-to-student sexual assault cases. Examples of employee-to-student sexual assault allegations for which the district did not fulfill its Title IX obligations include: In 2018, a teacher performed a “sexual act” on a student in the teacher’s classroom immediately after school. After the student told a third party, who reported the incident to law enforcement, law enforcement questioned and arrested the teacher, who later pleaded guilty to unlawful sexual conduct with a minor. The district allowed this teacher to resign without conducting a Title IX investigation to determine whether this student or other students needed remedies under Title IX, and if so to provide them. In 2019, a former student reported to a district counselor that a teacher had groomed her, inappropriately touched her exposed lower back, kissed her multiple times, and done the same to two other students. After the district interviewed multiple former and current students, the principal described how the teacher: (a) singled out female students and found out if they came from a single parent or distressed home; (b) crossed emotional and physical lines with the female students; (c) promised them specific rewards; and (d) found ways to be alone with them and to kiss them. The principal wrote, “As we investigated we heard the same story again and again. … [I]t was eerie how similar the stories were, even though most ended early with the students transferring or quitting.” After the teacher denied the allegations and blamed the girls for misunderstanding his teaching methods, the teacher retired at the end of the school year. OCR found no evidence that the district provided current students interim measures or investigated to determine if the teacher’s conduct created a hostile environment for current or former students that required redress. In 2017, after a parent complained to the district about an employee who hugged and kissed on the cheek several female elementary school students as they exited the school bus on multiple occasions, the district confirmed through video footage that the employee had hugged and kissed students. Yet, the district produced no evidence that it conducted any interviews, contacted any parents, imposed its recommended disciplinary action, or offered any remedies to the students whom the employee hugged and kissed. Apart from these employee-to-student incidents, the district involved its Title IX coordinator in only one of 88 reported student-to-student sexual assaults in the 2017-18 through 2019-20 school years. OCR did not find evidence that the district investigated whether the 88 reported incidents had created a hostile environment for the harassed students, as required by Title IX, thus potentially limiting or denying their access to education. OCR also identified compliance concerns about the district’s responses to off-campus sexual harassment that created a hostile environment for students in school, its training for employees responsible for ensuring its compliance with Title IX, and its recordkeeping system to track incidents of sexual harassment. As an example of the district’s flawed recordkeeping, OCR notes that the district had reported only one sexual assault for OCR’s 2017-18 Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC), whereas the district reported 20 student-to-student sexual assaults during that same year in this compliance review. The district agreed to resolve the Title IX violations and concerns that OCR identified in a resolution agreement to ensure nondiscrimination on the basis of sex in its schools. “Alpine School District failed to meet its Title IX obligations to protect students from sexual assaults, including by district employees, and operated a broadly noncompliant system for responding to sex discrimination in its schools,” said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon. “This resolution commits the district now to provide the safe and nondiscriminatory learning environment the district’s more than 81,000 students have deserved.” The resolution agreement includes: Ensuring that the district coordinates all of its efforts to comply with Title IX through its Title IX coordinator(s) moving forward. Notifying students, parents, and employees of its designated Title IX coordinator(s). Revising Title IX policies and procedures to comply with the Title IX regulations. Disseminating a notice of nondiscrimination that complies with the Title IX regulations. Training employees and students regarding the district’s Title IX procedures, how to identify what constitutes sexual harassment, and how to report such harassment. Reviewing case files for reported incidents of employee-to-student and student-to-student sexual harassment from school years 2017-18 through 2019-20 to determine if further action is needed to provide an equitable resolution of each incident. Improving its record-keeping system to ensure that records about sexual harassment are created and maintained and to report complete and accurate date to the CRDC. Administering school climate surveys to students, parents, and district employees. And, Reporting to OCR on its responses to reports and complaints of sexual harassment during OCR’s monitoring of the resolution agreement.

21-Sep-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-awards-more-40-million-support-hispanic-serving-institutions,Biden-Harris Administration Awards More Than $40 Million to Support Hispanic-Serving Institutions,"The Biden-Harris Administration announced today that it will award more than $40 million to Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs) to support Hispanic and Latino students and the institutions preparing them for the future. Through the Developing Hispanic-Serving Institutions (DHSI) program, 64 grants totaling more than $37 million were provided to assist HSIs to expand educational opportunities and improve the attainment of Hispanic students. Through the Minority Science and Engineering Improvement Program (MSEIP), which assists predominantly minority institutions with funds to improve science and engineering programs and to increase enrollment of underrepresented minority students, particularly women of color, in scientific and technological careers, more than $3.8 million was awarded to 15 HSIs. These grants build on the historic Biden-Harris Administration investments in HSIs including nearly $15 billion in funding from the U.S. Department of Education (Department), which included more than $13.2 billion in COVID relief funds. “The Biden-Harris Administration has made historic investments in Hispanic-Serving Institutions and today we’re continuing that commitment with another $40 million to drive Latino student success in higher education and help colleges and universities enroll more women and students of color in cutting-edge STEM fields,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “At a time when diversity in higher education is under attack, investing in Hispanic-Serving Institutions and the students they serve has never mattered more. Latino students represent nearly one-in-five college students across America and their talent, ambition, and multilingual superpowers will drive our nation’s future prosperity and global competitiveness for decades to come.” In addition to the DHSI and MSEIP grants, federal agencies across government commemorated National Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI) Week through a range of in-person and online engagements aimed at bridging federal resources with HSIs and Latino students, educators and community members. The White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity for Hispanics (Initiative) at the Department convened the President’s Advisory Commission on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity for Hispanics (Commission) at Arizona State University on September 12. The event was held in collaboration with leaders from the White House, U.S. Department of Defense, and U.S. Department of Commerce, and attendees engaged in several events with Arizona HSI Presidents, faculty, staff, and students to showcase the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to Hispanic students.

20-Sep-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-approves-37-million-borrower-defense-discharges-over-1200-students-who-attended-university-phoenix,"Biden-Harris Administration Approves $37 Million in Borrower Defense Discharges for Over 1,200 Students Who Attended the University of Phoenix","The Biden-Harris Administration today announced the approval of nearly $37 million in borrower defense to repayment discharges for more than 1,200 students who enrolled at the University of Phoenix (Phoenix) between Sept. 21, 2012, and Dec. 31, 2014, and applied for relief. The U.S. Department of Education (Department) found that a national ad campaign from Phoenix misled prospective students by falsely representing that its partnerships with thousands of corporations, including Fortune 500 companies, would benefit students by, for example, giving them hiring preferences at those companies. In fact, Phoenix’s corporate partnerships provided no such benefits to students. The approved applications are from borrowers who enrolled in Phoenix during the covered time period and filed borrower defense applications that made allegations corroborated by this finding. Today’s announcement brings the total amount of debt cancellation approved by the Biden-Harris Administration to more than $117 billion – including $14.8 billion in relief for 1.1 million borrowers whose colleges took advantage of them or closed abruptly. “The University of Phoenix brazenly deceived prospective students with false ads to get them to enroll,” said Federal Student Aid Chief Operating Officer Richard Cordray. “Students who trusted the school and wanted to better their lives through education ended up with mounds of debt and useless degrees. Today’s announcement builds on the FTC’s work to provide relief to those affected by Phoenix’s misconduct and delivers on the Biden-Harris Administration’s mission to support student loan borrowers.” The Department reviewed evidence obtained by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in its multi-year investigation into Phoenix that was ultimately resolved through a $191 million action in 2019, as well as evidence obtained from Phoenix during the Department’s fact-finding process. The evidence obtained by FTC included internal emails, policies, and procedures; recorded phone calls with prospective Phoenix students; and draft and final advertisements. “Students deceived by the University of Phoenix deserve strong relief, and today’s action is an important step forward,” said Director of FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection Samuel Levine. “We will continue to work with our state and federal partners to protect students.” Based on the evidence, the Department found that Phoenix’s substantial misrepresentations included the following: During its “Let’s Get to Work” national advertisement campaign, which began on Sept. 21, 2012, as well as in-recruitment calls and meetings, Phoenix misled borrowers about their employment prospects by misrepresenting the nature of Phoenix’s relationships with renowned and high-profile companies, including Microsoft, Adobe, AT&T, and the American Red Cross. Phoenix represented that its relationship with these companies created unique job opportunities for Phoenix students, which was not true. The school told borrowers that a Phoenix degree would help “get your foot in a few thousand doors” and that its corporate partners were “looking specifically at University of Phoenix students for hire instead of any other school,” which also was not true. Phoenix did not have partnerships with companies to provide hiring preferences for its students. In fact, the school’s relationship with corporate partners did not result in any benefits to impacted Phoenix students. Corporate partners let Phoenix display their insignias and names in a career database portal, which gave the false impression that Phoenix offered unique job opportunities, when in reality all the jobs posted were available to the general public. Phoenix management was aware that the corporate relationships the school claimed to have did not exist. One senior vice president at Phoenix described one of the advertisements in question as “smoke & mirrors.” Another conceded to other company executives that the “Let’s Get to Work” ad campaign lacked factual support and needed improvement. Despite these concerns, Phoenix continued to falsely advertise its “connection” and “partnership” with corporate employers for more than two years, until December 2014. The evidence demonstrated that Phoenix promised borrowers unique employment opportunities or connections to high-profile employers, but those promises were empty. Phoenix borrowers reasonably relied on these substantial misrepresentations to their detriment. Therefore, the Department determined that it is appropriate to grant complete relief on federal student loans for Phoenix borrowers who enrolled within the eligible period based on Phoenix’s hiring partner misrepresentations. Today’s announcement continues to demonstrate the importance for students and taxpayers of a strong partnership between the Department and other Federal agencies, like the FTC. The Department thanks the FTC for supporting this work to provide relief to students who were harmed, which built on the FTC’s success in obtaining a significant settlement from Phoenix in 2019. The Department will notify affected borrowers by early October that their applications have been approved. These borrowers will see any remaining loan balances zeroed out and credit trade lines deleted. Any payments they made to the Department on their related Federal student loans will be refunded. The Department also intends to initiate a recoupment proceeding against Phoenix to seek repayment of the liabilities associated with these approved claims at a later date. Borrowers who may qualify for relief because they have been affected by this finding can visit StudentAid.gov/borrower-defense to learn how to apply for borrower defense. Unwavering commitment to relief The Biden-Harris Administration remains steadfast in its commitment to use all available tools to deliver students, borrowers, and their families the relief they are entitled to. In addition to improvements to borrower defense, the Administration has also undertaken fixes to ensure that borrowers get relief promised by Congress through income-driven repayment programs, Public Service Loan Forgiveness, and discharges for borrowers with a total and permanent disability. The Department is also continuing a rulemaking process to provide further student loan relief to borrowers."

In addition to persistent and significant racial disparities in district disciplinary referral rates and suspension rates generally that OCR confirmed as recently as the 2022-23 school year, OCR’s investigation found evidence suggesting that African American students were subjected to harsher discipline than white students with similar discipline histories and conduct. For example, OCR’s analysis of district discipline records showed that: African American students were more likely than white students to be suspended for their first offense of the school year overall. African American students were suspended at higher rates than white students for first-time offenses for certain offense levels and certain specific offenses. And, African American students were suspended for lengthier periods than white students, on average, for first offenses of fighting. During the 2022-23 school year, the district reported that African American students received 57.2% of discipline resulting in in-school or out-of-school suspension and white students received 14.2% of such discipline as of March 2023; in that school year, 29% of district students were African American and 34% were white. OCR was also concerned that the discipline code in effect prior to 2022 did not clearly define some of the most common offenses, which may have contributed to the different treatment of students based on race suggested in district records. While the district recently revised its discipline code to include definitions for most offenses that should provide better guidance to staff, the revised 2022 code leaves OCR concerned about the clarity of the guidance to staff and administrators about when to make referrals and how to determine appropriate consequences, particularly given the broad range of potential consequences for many offenses. To resolve these concerns before OCR completed investigation of the district, WS/FCS committed to take steps to ensure that its disciplinary practices do not discriminate against students on the basis of race in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, building on the district’s previous efforts to promote equity in student discipline. WS/FCS agreed to: Review its current discipline code to determine if further revisions are necessary. Continue to train administrators and staff on the discipline code. Collect complete and accurate data on all disciplinary referrals. Analyze its current discipline data for evidence of unlawful discrimination or failure to comply with the discipline code. Put in place corrective actions to address any concerns it identifies through its data analysis. Coordinate with local law enforcement agencies on School Resource Officer data collection, training, and monitoring. Conduct an assessment, with consideration of revision, of alternative school programs for students who commit discipline violations to determine program effectiveness as well as assess whether referrals to these programs are consistent with the district discipline code. Provide information on its discipline policies for students and families. And, Submit to OCR annual reports regarding the effectiveness of WS/FCS’s efforts for OCR review and assessment. “Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Schools has agreed today to take important additional steps to ensure it administers student discipline without discrimination on the basis of race,” said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon. “I look forward to ongoing work with this district as it offers all its students the nondiscriminatory learning environment federal law requires.” In partnership with the U.S. Department of Justice, the Department of Education recently released a Resource on Confronting Racial Discrimination in Student Discipline that describes how the departments have resolved similar investigations in other school districts.

19-Sep-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-announces-2023-blue-ribbon-schools,U.S. Department of Education Announces 2023 Blue Ribbon Schools,"The U.S. Department of Education today recognized 353 schools as National Blue Ribbon Schools for 2023. The recognition is based on a school’s overall academic performance or progress in closing achievement gaps among student groups on assessments. “The honorees for our 2023 National Blue Ribbon Schools Award have set a national example for what it means to Raise the Bar in education,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “The leaders, educators, and staff at our National Blue Ribbon Schools continually inspire me with their dedication to fostering academic excellence and building positive school cultures that support students of all backgrounds to thrive academically, socially, and emotionally. As the Biden-Harris Administration partners with states and schools to accelerate academic success and transform educational opportunity in this country, we take tremendous pride in the achievements of these schools and their commitment to empowering educators, serving students, and engaging families.” With its 40th cohort, the National Blue Ribbon Schools Program has bestowed approximately 10,000 awards to more than 9,700 schools. The National Blue Ribbon School award affirms and validates the hard work of students, educators, families, and communities in striving for – and attaining – exemplary achievement. National Blue Ribbon Schools represent the full diversity of American schools and serve students of every background. While awardee schools represent the diverse fabric of American schools, they also share some core elements. National Blue Ribbon School leaders articulate a vision of excellence and hold everyone to high standards. They demonstrate effective and innovative teaching and learning, and the schools value and support teachers and staff through meaningful professional learning. Data from many sources are used to drive instruction and every student strives for success. Families, communities, and educators work together toward common goals. National Blue Ribbon Schools serve as models of effective and innovative school practices for state and district educators and other schools throughout the nation. A National Blue Ribbon School flag gracing a school’s entryway or on a flagpole is a widely recognized symbol of exemplary teaching and learning. The Department recognizes all schools in one of two performance categories, based on all student scores, subgroup student scores and graduation rates: Exemplary High-Performing Schools are among their state’s highest performing schools as measured by state assessments or nationally normed tests. Exemplary Achievement Gap-Closing Schools are among their state’s highest performing schools in closing achievement gaps between a school’s student groups and all students. Nominated schools also complete an extensive narrative application describing their school culture and philosophy, curriculum, assessments, instructional practices, professional development, leadership structures, and parent and community involvement. Up to 420 schools may be nominated each year. The Department invites nominations for the National Blue Ribbon Schools award from the top education official in all states, the District of Columbia, U.S. territories, the Department of Defense Education Activity, and the Bureau of Indian Education. Private schools are nominated by the Council for American Private Education.

18-Sep-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/secretaries-education-agriculture-call-governors-equitably-fund-land-grant-hbcus,"Secretaries of Education, Agriculture Call on Governors to Equitably Fund Land-Grant HBCUs","U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona and U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Thomas Vilsack today sent letters to 16 governors emphasizing the over $12 billion disparity in funding between land-grant Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and their non-HBCU land-grant peers in their states. The 16 governors receiving the letter are: Alabama – Gov. Kay Ivey Arkansas – Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders Florida – Gov. Ron DeSantis Georgia – Gov. Brian Kemp Kentucky – Gov. Andy Beshear Louisiana – Gov. John Bel Edwards Maryland – Gov. Wes Moore Mississippi – Gov. Tate Reeves Missouri – Gov. Michael Parson North Carolina – Gov. Roy Cooper Oklahoma – Gov. J. Kevin Stitt South Carolina – Gov. Henry McMaster Tennessee – Gov. Bill Lee Texas – Gov. Greg Abbott Virginia – Gov. Glenn Youngkin West Virginia – Gov. James C. Justice, II There are HBCU land-grant institutions in 18 states; however, Delaware and Ohio have equitably funded their respective universities. “Unacceptable funding inequities have forced many of our nation’s distinguished Historically Black Colleges and Universities to operate with inadequate resources and delay critical investments in everything from campus infrastructure to research and development to student support services,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “I am continually inspired by all that HBCUs have achieved despite having to punch above their weight. Our HBCUs graduate a huge share of our nation’s Black educators, doctors, engineers, judges, and lawyers. These institutions and the talented, diverse students they serve must have equitable funding in order to reach their full potential and continue driving innovation. The Biden-Harris Administration is proud to have made record investments in our HBCUs, but to compete in the 21st century we need state leaders to step up and live up to their legally required obligations to our historically Black land-grant institutions.” “Some of the brightest minds and most impactful advancements in food and agriculture have taken root in our country’s 1890 land-grant universities, and I’m incredibly proud of the partnership USDA maintains with these invaluable institutions. We need governors to help us invest in their states’ HBCU’s at the equitable level their students deserve, and reflective of all they contribute to our society and economy,” said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. “The documented discrepancies are a clarion call for governors to act without delay to provide significant support for the 1890 land-grant institutions in their respective states. Failing to do so will have severe and lasting consequences to the agriculture and food industry at a time when it must remain resilient and competitive.” Under the Second Morrill Act of 1890, states choosing to open a second land-grant university to serve Black students were required to provide an equitable distribution of state funds between their 1862 and 1890 land-grant institutions. 1862 land-grant universities were founded through the First Morrill Act of 1862 which provided states with federal land that could be sold to support the colleges. Using data from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) Integrated Postsecondary Education Survey (IPEDS) that ranges from 1987 to 2020, the departments were able to calculate the amount that these institutions would have received if their state funding per student was equal to that of 1862 institutions. Unequitable appropriated funding of the 1890 institutions in the states ranges from $172 million to $2.1 billion, causing severe financial gaps. In the last 30 years alone, these funds could have supported vital and much-needed infrastructure and student services and would have better positioned the recipient universities to compete for grants to increase educational opportunity for students. Noting that it is more important than ever to compete at a high level and remain the world’s top producer of talent and innovation, the Departments of Education and Agriculture have offered to work with each state’s budget office to examine the funding data to bring balance to investments in 1890 HBCUs that have been severely underfunded. Each letter outlined the amount each state’s 1890 HBCU has been underfunded per student in state appropriated funds between 1987 and 2020 and offers a suggestion on possible remedies.

The nearly $199 million in funding for the Pathways to Partnerships innovative model demonstration project supports collaborative partnerships between state vocational rehabilitation agencies, state and local educational agencies, and federally funded centers for independent living to help individuals with disabilities seamlessly transition to life after high school, preparing them for independent living, competitive integrated employment and community integration. Pathways to Partnerships is the largest discretionary grant ever administered by RSA. “The Department is committed to providing children and youth with disabilities the supports they need to access self-advocacy training, career pathways and independent living. The Pathways to Partnerships will bridge gaps from school to adult life, independent living, and career success,” said Glenna Wright-Gallo, Assistant Secretary for the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS), which oversees RSA. “This investment will not only require state and local agencies to improve outcomes for individuals with disabilities by finding innovative ways of working together, but it will also look to unlock post school and career success for those individuals.” Pathways to Partnerships, part of the Disability Innovation Fund program aimed at increasing for youth and other individuals with disabilities, serves as a step to improving economic self-sufficiency and decreasing the unemployment disparity between youth without disabilities and youth with disabilities. This announcement builds on a key component of the Department’s “Raise the Bar: Lead the World” initiative to support individuals from underserved communities, ensure every student has a pathway to college or a career , and improve transition services for students with disabilities . The Department awarded recipients of the Pathways to Partnership grants the full funding for a five-year project period – meaning successful applicants receive all project funds at the beginning of year one. Through the five-year project period, award recipients will pilot, refine and implement their proposed projects while also collecting and analyzing project data.

The complaint alleged that during the first week of the 2022-2023 school year, an individual posted on social media an anonymous threat of sexual violence against freshman girls at a district high school and that the district was aware of the posting but did not respond consistent with Title IX. In addition, OCR’s investigation reflected that the school held an assembly only for girls, without holding an assembly for boys, to address dress code compliance, ostensibly to respond in part to notice of sexually harassing social media postings of which the district had notice – and in that assembly the district communicated to the girls that they were “opening the door” to harassment with their manner of dress and then “wonder why they [boys] disrespect you.” OCR confirmed that the school did not hold any dress code assembly for boys, although boys had incurred half the dress code violations imposed at the school during the past two school years. OCR’s investigation supported concerns that the district did not respond as required by Title IX to notice that students at the school may have been subjected to sexual harassment that impeded their access to the school’s education program and activities and that the district selectively enforced its dress code based on sex stereotypes, inconsistent with Title IX. “The nondiscrimination guarantee in Title IX promises that girls not be blamed for their own sexual harassment as well as that students will not be subjected to differential school rule enforcement based on sex stereotypes,” said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon. “Consistent with that guarantee, Nash County Public Schools commits now to ensuring that all students can fully participate in school without discrimination based on sex.” The resolution agreement provides that the district will: (1) review and, as necessary, revise its dress code to ensure it does not discriminate on the basis of sex and inform students, parents, and staff that they may contact the district’s Title IX coordinator if they believe the dress code has been administered in a discriminatory manner; (2) train staff at the high school about their Title IX obligations, including with respect to responding to reports of sexual harassment, enforcing the dress code in a non-discriminatory manner, and not separating students based on sex except as permitted by Title IX; and (3) review reports of sexual harassment at the high school, investigate the reports as required by Title IX and the district’s grievance procedures, assess the need for supportive measures for students, and notify students and parents at the high school about how to file Title IX complaints.

12-Sep-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-actions-build-work-accelerate-learning-and-improve-student-achievement,FACT SHEET: Biden-Harris Administration Announces New Actions to Build on Work to Accelerate Learning and Improve Student Achievement,"When President Biden took office, fewer than half of K-12 schools were fully open for in-person learning. Today, thanks to the President's swift actions and historic investments, every school in America is open safely for in-person instruction. Since Day One, President Biden has worked to help every school accelerate academic achievement, open safely for in-person instruction, and build communities where all students feel they belong. Today, the Administration is building on its extensive record of investment in K-12 public schools and announcing additional actions to improve instruction and accelerate academic success nationwide as students begin the new school year. The announcements include actions to: Improve reading and math outcomes for students, including about $50 million in funding to States for literacy interventions and supports; Expand school capacity by building a diverse educator workforce and infusing approximately 187,000 new tutors and mentors into schools; Support evidence-based strategies to reduce chronic absenteeism in schools; and Support states in leveraging funding through President Biden's Bipartisan Safer Communities Act to meet the growing mental health and safety needs of students. This is all part of the U.S. Department of Education's ""Raise the Bar: Lead the World"" effort to transform education and bring parents, teachers, community leaders, and students together around what truly works—based on decades of experience and research—to advance educational equity and excellence. ""As students across America head back to school, the Biden-Harris administration is building upon our efforts to ensure students' academic success and meet our collective need, as a country, to Raise the Bar in education,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""To address years of decline in core areas like math and literacy, made worse by challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic, it's vital for schools to focus relentlessly on strengthening instruction, providing targeted supports such as extended learning time, and working intentionally with families and caregivers to ensure our children and youth are present and fully engaged in school. From continued investments to strengthen literacy instruction, to exciting progress towards recruiting 250,000 tutors and mentors through the National Partnership for Student Success, to historic support for students' mental health and wellness, the Department of Education will continue to partner with educators, school leaders, and state and local education officials to increase successful academic outcomes for all students."" Today's announcements include: Improving Student Reading & Math Outcomes Delivering additional funding to States for literacy interventions: Reading on grade level by third grade is crucial to future academic success. When students read on grade level, they are more likely to come to school, be engaged, and graduate on time. To advance effective literacy practices, the Department is announcing about $50 million in new grants to support States and educational partners in developing and implementing evidence-based literacy interventions and supports. These awards, through the Comprehensive Literacy State Development and Innovative Approaches to Literacy programs, help States, school districts, and communities promote equitable access to high quality literacy instruction and materials for every student. Additionally, the Department will launch new technical assistance efforts to help States bolster literacy skills for students most in need. Read more about the awards here . Elevating evidence-based practices to improve math instruction and student outcomes: Even before the pandemic, gaps in mathematics performance were widening. In the coming weeks, the Department's Institute of Education Sciences (IES) will convene researchers and practitioners to share effective strategies for national, State, and local leaders in PreK-12 math instruction and STEAM pathways for student success in school and beyond. The 2023 IES Math Summit will highlight districts that have made progress in improving student learning and outcomes and address key math instructional issues, including differentiating instruction for diverse learners, high-dosage tutoring, and high school pathways. IES invites interested participants to register here . Improving access to data to help students learn on grade level: As schools work to put every student on a path to academic success, it is critically important that educators have access to high-quality assessment data that can help guide instruction and meet student needs. Complementary to statewide assessments that are usually held toward the end of the school year, diagnostic and formative assessments – developed and driven at the local level, and administered throughout the school year – provide teachers, school leaders, and parents with a timely picture of a student's academic growth. With this data in hand, educators can better adjust their approaches and tailor supports to help students more quickly reach proficiency in reading and math, and provide parents with additional information on how their child is progressing over time. The Administration will engage school districts and their partners to improve access to formative and diagnostic tools, alongside the information they receive from annual statewide assessments, to help schools better improve achievement by targeting high-dosage tutoring or other individualized supports to students who need it most. Helping schools better identify students who need additional support: The Department will launch resources this fall to support schools' efforts to frequently review student-level data and identify a range of supports for students with varying levels of academic, social, emotional, and behavioral needs – what are referred to as multi-tiered systems of support (MTSS). The Department will invest over $21 million for a technical assistance center focused on MTSS and positive behavior intervention and supports over the next five years. These supports, alongside the use of formative and diagnostic assessment data, will help schools tailor instruction and student supports across classrooms and target interventions where help is needed most. Addressing Absenteeism Increasing attendance at school: Academic success depends on regular, in-person learning and engagement at school. However, too many students are missing valuable learning time, and student attendance rates are lower than pre-pandemic levels. With nearly four in five States using chronic absence as a component of their system for designating schools for support and improvement, the Department will hold States accountable for ensuring they fulfill commitments they have made to collect chronic absenteeism data and monitor States on the interventions they use to support schools targeted for improvement, including through the use of school improvement funds. The Department will also offer guidance to states on leading practices for responding to chronic absenteeism – deploying its Student Engagement and Attendance Center (SEAC) to disseminate evidence-based strategies and actionable tools for engaging students and their families. SEAC will deliver technical assistance on evidence-based practices that States, districts, and schools have used to drive increases in attendance, such as Connecticut's home-visiting program and effective parent and student engagement strategies, such as the use of ""nudges,"" like texting parents to inform parents when their student is absent. Expanding the Capacity of Schools to Deliver High-Quality Support for Students Answering the President's call to action to get more adults in schools supporting students: The Department, AmeriCorps, and the Everyone Graduates Center at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) launched the National Partnership for Student Success (NPSS), a public-private partnership in Summer 2022 to meet the President's goal of bringing 250,000 new tutors and mentors into schools by 2025. Today, researchers from JHU released new findings showing that, in the last school year alone, an estimated 187,000 caring adults stepped forward to provide additional supports to students in schools—nearly 75 percent of the President's goal. Researchers also found that 53 percent of public schools provided high-intensity tutoring to students last school year, including 62 percent of schools where the majority of students received free or reduced- price lunch. The Administration continues to invite additional States and other organizations to join NPSS; they can join by visiting here . Support for educators and school staff in addressing school needs: No in-school factor matters more for student learning than the availability of well-prepared and supported educators. The Department will continue its support to States in launching and scaling high-quality apprenticeship programs for teachers and regularly update new data tools that help track progress in addressing shortages at the State level. In the coming weeks, the Department will also launch new efforts with external stakeholders around teacher recruitment aimed at diversifying the teacher profession and supporting a strong, diverse educator workforce. These efforts build on historic ARP investments that have helped restore 635,000 local public education jobs lost during the pandemic and the work to expand the number of States with registered teacher apprenticeship programs from two to 23 in the past year. In addition, the Administration has taken action to address challenges with the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program, resulting in more than 653,000 borrowers, including educators, receiving forgiveness, totaling more than $45 billion. Leveraging BSCA to Address Gun Violence and Improve Student Mental Health Supporting students' mental health to increase engagement in school: Over the last several years, our nation's young people have faced unprecedented challenges and disruptions in their schools and communities – including increased gun violence, social isolation, and other repercussions from a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic. To address this epidemic, President Biden enacted the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA), which secured $1 billion for states to invest in improving school climate and safety and another $1 billion supporting school-based student mental health services. The Department will continue to highlight ways to leverage BSCA funds to improve school climate, student attendance, and mental health to meet the growing needs of students, and how additional grant opportunities like the Full-Service Community School Program and the Promise Neighborhoods Program can be used support student health and well-being and school attendance and engagement. Additionally, the Department will work to increase the number of States and schools that offer school-based services for children enrolled in Medicaid and ensure that schools are trained and equipped to bill Medicaid for eligible services through expanded use of the Medicaid Technical Assistance Center, jointly administered by the Department and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services."

The four-part series was part of the U.S. Department of Education’s Raise the Bar: Unlocking Career Success initiative, aimed at helping young Americans access good-paying jobs created by President Biden’s Bidenomics agenda. The series was supported by the Departments of Transportation, Energy, Commerce, and Labor to increase and expand access to high-quality career pathways helping young Americans prepare for careers of the future in in-demand fields. The Summit series was co-hosted with the national education and workforce development organization Jobs for the Future (JFF), and more than 500 guests from more than 36 states attended the convenings to highlight workforce priorities and growing opportunities for young people created by historic recent federal investments, including the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Inflation Reduction Act , and CHIPS and Science Act . Each Summit included state teams of key decision makers across the K-12, Higher Education, and Workforce systems, and the U.S. Department of Education (Department) was joined at each event by senior leadership from both federal agency partners and state leaders, including Gov. Jared Polis of Colorado and Gov. Tony Evers of Wisconsin. The series kicked off in Renton, Washington , where the Department partnered with the Department of Transportation to discuss construction and infrastructure pathways. At the Summit, the Department announced partnerships with Departments of Transportation, Energy, Commerce, and Labor to support state teams to connect across sectors to advance career-connected learning. At the Summit in Aurora, Colorado , U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona announced the launch of a $25 million Career Connected High School Grant , a new program that will provide grants to consortia of local educational agencies, institutions of higher education, and employers to pilot evidence-based strategies to increase the integration and alignment of high school, postsecondary education, and the world of work to improve postsecondary education and career outcomes for all students. In Madison, Wisconsin , Deputy Secretary of Education Cindy Marten announced 81 semi-finalists for Phase 2 of the Career Z Challenge , a challenge designed to identify local education agencies interested in creating or enhancing work-based learning (WBL) opportunities to engage students across grades 9-12 in meaningful career exploration, development, and preparation. The 81 semi-finalists represent 34 states and collectively serve more than 1.5 million students. At today’s final summit in Biloxi, Mississippi , representatives from Alabama and Mississippi shared regional exemplars that support students with disabilities to pursue competitive integrated employment and further connecting their education and workforce systems to support youth employment. Additionally, the Department announced the grand-prize winner of the Rural Tech Project. This is a $600,000 challenge to advance technology education and prepare students for the careers of today and tomorrow, administered by Luminary Labs. The winner, Woodlake High School in Woodlake, California, prepares students for regional aviation careers and postsecondary degrees, utilizing drone operations, geometry, and aerodynamic principles. Students use flight simulators, complete dual-credit college courses, and earn recognized industry certifications. As the grand-prize winner, Woodlake will receive an additional $100,000 prize. “High school students everywhere need more opportunities to build the advanced technology skills that our employers need, and our economy demands. These summits allowed us to gather key officials to work together to ensure our youth are ready for the jobs of the future,” said Amy Loyd, assistant secretary of the Department’s Office of Career, Technical, and Adult Education. “I am honored to congratulate Woodlake High School for their inspiring and innovative work in the Rural Tech Project. Woodlake’s aviation program engages students meaningfully through hands-on learning and real industry experiences, preparing them to pursue high demand, rewarding careers.” For more information about the Career Connected High School Grant , the Career Z Challenge , or the Rural Tech Project , and for more information about the broader Unlocking Career Success initiative, sign up for our newsletter here."

These events will support borrowers returning to repayment by providing information about available resources from the Department, including encouraging them to take full advantage of the Biden-Harris Administration’s new Saving on A Valuable Education (SAVE) income-driven repayment (IDR) plan and other debt relief programs. The Department launched the “SAVE on Student Debt” campaign last month, a public-private partnership with national grassroots organizations to get the word out to groups across the country about the SAVE plan. ""Thanks to President Biden's leadership, more than 4 million borrowers are already benefitting from more affordable student loan payments under the SAVE plan, but we know there are so many more individuals and working families who stand to gain,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""The Biden-Harris Administration is determined to get the word out about SAVE, and that’s why we’re thrilled to have 100 national organizations and grassroots groups joining us for this SAVE on Student Debt Week of Action. Our partners in the SAVE on Student Debt campaign will amplify Federal Student Aid's outreach and communications to borrowers by working in communities across the country to encourage enrollment in the SAVE plan, which not only offers lower monthly student loan payments, but also protects borrowers from runaway interest and ever-growing balances. The SAVE plan is the most affordable repayment plan ever created. Under SAVE, a single borrower who makes less than about $15 an hour will not have to make any payments, and borrowers earning above that amount would save more than $1,000 a year on their payments compared to the repayment plan that SAVE replaced. Borrowers with families will save even more. The SAVE plan also ensures that borrowers never see their balance grow due to unpaid interest as long as they keep up with their payments. The campaign will engage organizations across the public, private, and nonprofit sectors to help millions of eligible borrowers take full advantage of the benefits provided by the SAVE plan. During the Week of Action, participating organizations will scale up communications to their members, borrowers and the public at a critical moment as federal student loan begins accruing and borrowers are considering their options for repayment in October. To see a full list of participating organizations or sign up in support, check out saveonstudentdebt.org/weekofaction. Some of the activities planned for the week of action include: Federal and State Agency Outreach Federal Student Aid will host one of many webinars for borrowers as repayment resume. The webinar will include information about the new SAVE plan, the Fresh Start option to help borrowers get out of default, Public Service Loan Forgiveness, and steps borrowers can take to prepare for repayment.

Later in the month, SDCC will mobilize young leaders to take action on their college campuses. UnidosUS will host a virtual roundtable for Latino families and mobilize its national network of affiliates, allies, and supporters via a targeted social media campaign to raise awareness in the Latino community about the SAVE plan and othermstudent loan resources. Young Invincibles will host a roundtable in Texas with borrowers and FSA Chief Operating Officer Rich Cordray and will train Texas-based organizations in effective borrower outreach on SAVE and other student loan repayment options. Organizations sharing information with their networks The American Council on Education (ACE) will continue to send their member college presidents materials for distribution to students, parents, and alumni about resources available to student loan borrowers, including the benefits of the SAVE plan. ACE member colleges and universities educate two out of every three students in all accredited, degree-granting U.S. institutions. The National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators (NASFAA) will share resources on student loan repayment to be distributed by financial aid officers at nearly 3,000 colleges and universities across the United States. NASFAA member institutions serve nine out of every 10 undergraduates in the United States. The National Association of Student Loan Lawyers (NASLL) will ask each of their attorney members to notify their clients and post on social media. The Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) will share resources with their members, detailing how employers and HR offices can support employees in accessing SAVE and other relevant student loan programs such as Public Service Loan Forgiveness. United Way will share information with more than 1,000 local affiliates. Additionally, they will distribute materials to their 211 network call centers, to share with borrowers who call in for support accessing public benefits. The Department and its servicers have reached out directly to nearly 30 million borrowers to invite them to use the new IDR application to apply for the SAVE plan. This outreach is part of the Department's robust campaign to provide information and resources to borrowers to support them. The Department has also been in direct touch with 43 million borrowers and will continue to coordinate with servicers and outside partners to provide additional high-quality communications with specific, actionable information directly to borrowers to make sure every borrower has the information they need to make the best repayment decision for themselves. In addition, the Department has instituted a 12-month on-ramp to protect borrowers from the harshest consequences of missed, partial, or late payments. The SAVE plan builds on the work the Biden-Harris Administration has already done to improve the student loan program and make higher education more affordable. The Biden-Harris Administration has already approved more than $117 billion in targeted relief for 3.4 million student loan borrowers, including: $39 billion for 804,000 borrowers through fixing historical inaccuracies in the IDR payment count system for borrowers who earned forgiveness; $45.7 billion for 662,000 public servants through improvements to Public Service Loan Forgiveness; $10.5 billion for 491,000 borrowers who have a total and permanent disability; and $22 billion for nearly 1.3 million borrowers who were cheated by their schools, saw their schools precipitously close, or are covered by related court settlements. The Biden-Harris Administration remains committed to making college more affordable and ensuring student debt is not a roadblock to attaining a college degree or credential, or planning for the future. The Administration has made the largest increase to Pell Grants in a decade and has charted a course to double the maximum Pell Grant and make community college free to enhance college affordability and reduce unnecessary student debt. The Administration is also holding institutions accountable for unaffordable debts and recently proposed regulations that would set standards for earnings and debt outcomes for career programs while enhancing transparency for all programs to give students the information they need to make informed choices.

7-Sep-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-educations-office-civil-rights-resolves-restraint-and-seclusion-compliance-review-spectrum-academy-utah,U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights Resolves Restraint and Seclusion Compliance Review of Spectrum Academy in Utah,"Today, the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) resolved a compliance review of Spectrum Academy in Utah to ensure that the Academy’s restraint and seclusion policies and practices do not deny students with disabilities their civil rights in violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504), Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (Title II), and their implementing regulations. OCR’s investigation revealed that the Academy failed to hold required Individualized Education Program (IEP) meetings for specific students with disabilities to evaluate the impact on the students of repeated use of restraint and seclusion and failed to consider the need for compensatory services for these students. In addition, OCR identified compliance concerns related to another 26 students whom the Academy subjected to a high number of restraints and seclusions. The Academy may have failed to consider the educational impact on these students of repeated use of restraint and seclusion. OCR also identified a concern that the Academy may have failed to re-evaluate the students to determine if the Academy’s repeated use of restraint and seclusion caused them to miss instruction or services, denied them a free appropriate public education (FAPE), and indicated a need for additional aids and services to ensure a FAPE. OCR also had a concern that the Academy did not evaluate the need for or offer compensatory services to these students for missed services and instruction. Finally, OCR identified a compliance concern that the Academy’s record keeping practices may have prevented the Academy from being able to determine whether its current array of special education and related aids and services was sufficient to provide a FAPE. OCR also noted significant inaccuracy in the Academy’s reporting to the 2017-18 Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC) for the 2017-18 CRDC, the Academy reported 50 instances of physical restraint and 33 instances of seclusion, whereas the information the Academy reported to OCR for this compliance review reflected that there were approximately 276 total instances of restraint and seclusion that school year. This data discrepancy suggests that the Academy’s system for maintaining records regarding restraint and seclusion may be inadequate to allow the Academy to accurately report incidents of restraint to the CRDC. The Academy agreed to resolve these violations and compliance concerns by making significant changes to its policies, procedures, and training requirements with respect to the use of restraint and seclusion. The Academy also agreed to remedy prior instances where restraint and seclusion of its students denied or may have denied them a FAPE, and to develop a monitoring program to ensure that any future restraint or seclusion complies with Section 504 and Title II. “Spectrum Academy has committed to important steps to ensure that its emergency use of restraint or seclusion does not deny students with disabilities their federally protected civil rights,” said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon. The steps the Academy committed to take in a resolution agreement include: Revising and distributing to Academy staff its policies, procedures, and forms for restraint and seclusion to promote its compliance with Section 504 and Title II. Providing training on the revised policies and Section 504 FAPE-related requirements to all teachers, administrators, and other members of IEP and Section 504 teams. Providing individual remedies for students who experienced restraint or seclusion during the review period by convening a properly constituted IEP team to determine if compensatory services are needed, and if so, by timely providing such services. Conducting a review to determine whether any other Academy students were denied a FAPE due to the Academy’s use of restraint or seclusion from 2019 to the present, and to implement responsive remedies based on this review. Ensuring records about its use of restraint and seclusion are created and maintained and that it will accurately report data to the CRDC in future. And, Implementing a program to monitor the use of restraint and seclusion with students in the Academy’s schools to safeguard their rights under Section 504 and Title II. The letter to Spectrum Academy and the resolution agreement are available on OCR’s website."
7-Sep-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-announces-kindergarten-sturdy-bridge-learning-community,U.S. Department of Education Announces Kindergarten Sturdy Bridge Learning Community,"The U.S Department of Education (Department) is announcing the launch of the Kindergarten Sturdy Bridge Learning Community, a multi-state effort to make kindergarten a transformational experience at the start of each student’s formal education journey. State education agencies (SEAs) and local education agencies (LEAs) will be invited to participate in a community of practice where they can benefit from peer learning, receive technical assistance, and share best practices to transform how students experience kindergarten including the transitions into kindergarten and 1st grade. “Getting kindergarten right has to be top of mind for all of us, because what happens there sets the stage for how a child learns and develops well into their elementary years and beyond,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “Ensuring that kindergarten is a sturdy bridge between the early years and early grades is central to our efforts both to Raise the Bar for academic excellence and to provide all students with a more equitable foundation for educational success. The kindergarten year presents an opportunity to meet the strengths and needs of young learners so they can continue to flourish in the years to come.” Kindergarten is critical to our efforts to Raise the Bar for academic excellence because it opens the door to two timely and consequential opportunities to meet the strengths and needs of diverse young learners essential for later school success Kindergarten provides the first formal at-scale learning opportunity for students to receive many of the critical supports and interventions that are essential for on-track development. Children arrive at kindergarten from diverse settings and experiences, with a wide range of developmental and linguistic strengths, learning differences, developmental delays, and disabilities. In this way, attending kindergarten is a critical lever for meeting physical and behavioral health needs that would otherwise go undetected, undiagnosed, and untreated. Kindergarten also presents a crucial opportunity to build partnerships and trust with parents and families, and to work with them on nurturing the habits and routines, including everyday attendance, that are essential to accelerating learning recovery and assuring early and long-term school success. This announcement comes as Secretary Cardona is embarking on his “Back to School Bus Tour 2023: Raise the Bar” featuring stops in Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. Throughout the week, Secretary Cardona, Deputy Secretary Cindy Marten, and Under Secretary James Kvaal will join national, state, and local school leaders to speak with students, parents, and educators for events that celebrate the back-to-school season and underscore the Administration’s commitment to helping students recover from the impacts of the pandemic and continue on the road to success. As part of the bus tour, Administration officials will highlight academic and mental health programs and efforts to recruit and support educators funded by President Biden’s American Rescue Plan, which provided historic resources to K-12 schools, colleges, and universities to reopen schools and help students of all ages recover. Many states and school districts across the country are already making progress on these opportunities. The Kindergarten Sturdy Bridge Learning Community builds on the U.S. Department of Education’s continued commitment to advancing early learning and school readiness for the nation’s youngest learners. In December 2021, the Department launched two new multistate communities of practice to support states in addressing the impact of lost instructional time from the pandemic on students’ mental health and academic well-being. The Department has also been working with states and stakeholders to identify ways to leverage federal funding to support high quality early learning and the early learning workforce, including by leveraging $1 billion in Title IV, Part A funds of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act to support preschool-aged students who are served by high-need LEAs through a range of allowable activities that encourage students’ healthy growth and development. The Biden-Harris Administration has also proposed a first-ever preschool incentive demonstration program at the U.S. Department of Education to expand access to high-quality preschool in school and community-based settings for children eligible to attend Title I schools. This proposed $500 million investment in President Biden’s FY24 budget request to Congress would further support school districts and participating schools in aligning high-quality preschool programs with kindergarten through 3rd grade instruction, facilitating a successful transition from preschool to kindergarten and from kindergarten to 3rd grade. Consistent with President Biden’s Executive Order on Increasing Access to High-Quality Care and Supporting Caregivers—a first of its kind, government-wide commitment to support caregivers, direct care workers, and families caring for children, people with disabilities, and aging loved ones—this fall, the Department will issue additional guidance to school districts and grantees on utilizing federal funds to expand access to high-quality preschool in high-need schools. Additionally, the Department’s current Full Service Community Schools competition includes an invitational priority for applicants to focus on effective strategies for transition between early childhood settings and the early grades, promoting cross-sector collaboration and family engagement . Awards will be issued in late 2023."

The annual National HBCU Week Conference is the nation's premier convening of key influencers in the HBCU space. This announcement comes during the third stop of the Department of Education’s “Back to School Bus Tour,” where Secretary Cardona will visit a Missouri HBCU, Harris-Stowe State University to highlight the administration’s unprecedented support for HBCUs and student, including $7.3 billion in cumulative investments directly to HBCUs to date. The Biden-Harris administration is also announcing its 12th Project School Emergency Response to Violence (SERV) grant to Dillard University to address bomb threats the school received. Dillard, which is an HBCU located in New Orleans, Louisiana, was awarded over $287,000 to hire two fulltime mental health counselors to support university community members who are still managing anxiety following the incident. Dillard will also be using SERV funds for one year support of teletherapy for every member of the university community, as well as training programs for faculty, students, and staff to help cope and recover from the trauma caused by the incident. Dillard joins several HBCUs that have been previously awarded Project SERV grants. “Historically Black Colleges and Universities have embodied leadership, excellence, and innovation for centuries, continually punching above their weight and producing barrier-breaking graduates in every field imaginable,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “President Biden’s support for HBCUs has resulted in record investments in these institutions, and our National HBCU Week Conference gives higher education leaders, public officials, advocates and outside partners an opportunity to build on this momentum. At a time when the principles of equity, diversity, inclusion, and access in higher education are under attack across our country, working together to support HBCUs and the students they serve is more important than ever before.” The theme for this year’s HBCU Week Conference is Raising the Bar: Forging Excellence through Innovation & Leadership.

Additionally, the Department has received more than 1.6 million IDR applications through StudentAid.govsince July 30, and nearly one million of those applications are for the SAVE plan , the most affordable IDR plan ever. ""Millions of borrowers are already benefitting from enrollment in the SAVE plan, and I'm thrilled to see so many Americans submitting applications every day so that they, too, can take advantage of the most affordable student loan repayment plan in history,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""From Day One of this Administration, President Biden has focused on reducing the burden of student loan debt on working families, and we are not stopping now. Enrollment is quick and easy, and we are working relentlessly to get the word out to borrowers about how millions can reduce their monthly student loan bills and save over a thousand dollars a year by enrolling in SAVE."" Under the SAVE Plan, a single borrower who makes less than about $15 an hour will not have to make any payments, and borrowers earning above that amount would save more than $1,000 a year on their payments compared to other IDR plans. The SAVE Plan also ensures that borrowers never see their balance grow due to unpaid interest as long as they keep up with their payments. The new IDR application allows borrowers to have their income accessed securely from the Internal Revenue Service so they do not need to re-certify their income or re-apply for IDR plans every year. ""The new application is easy and quick. Most people only need about 10 minutes to complete it,"" said Federal Student Aid Chief Operating Officer Richard Cordray. ""Borrowers can get their monthly payment calculated in real time, and they can choose to have their IDR application recertified automatically each year."" Borrowers applying for the SAVE plan or other IDR plans will see their new payment amount before submitting their application, and it will be displayed on their servicer's website when their first bill is sent. Most borrowers who apply for the SAVE Plan can expect their next payment to reflect their SAVE amount. Servicers will place borrowers in a forbearance if they need more time to process their application. After borrowers apply, they can check the status of their application by visiting their account dashboard on StudentAid.gov . Borrowers can also use Loan Simulator to calculate student loan payments across other repayment plans and choose a loan repayment option that best meets their needs and goals. The Department and its servicers have reached out directly to nearly 30 million borrowers to invite them to use the new IDR application to apply for the SAVE Plan. This outreach is part of the Department's robust campaign to provide information and resources to borrowers to support them. The Department has also been in direct touch with 43 million borrowers and will continue to coordinate with servicers and outside partners to provide additional high-quality communications with specific, actionable information directly to borrowers to make sure every borrower has the information they need to make the best repayment decision for themselves. In addition, the Department has instituted a 12-month on-ramp to protect borrowers from the harshest consequences of missed, partial, or late payments. The Department has also begun a nationwide outreach campaign called "" SAVE on Student Debt"" in collaboration with leading grassroots organizations. ""SAVE on Student Debt"" is leveraging strategic partnerships across public, private, and nonprofit sectors to make sure borrowers know the supports available to them as they return to repayment and can they take full advantage the SAVE Plan and other available benefits and debt forgiveness programs.

5-Sep-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-promote-educator-diversity-through-national-convenings,U.S. Department of Education to Promote Educator Diversity Through National Convenings,"Extending its commitment to support school systems as they find new and innovative ways to encourage, invest in, and support teachers across America, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) will host two convenings focused on educator diversity. The two events, the Teach to Lead Summit and the Conference on Equity in Opportunity, will take place in Denver, Colorado, beginning on Oct. 26, 2023, and bring together key educational leaders for national conversations about the importance of educator diversity in our nation's schools. During these events, the Department will bring together leaders in effective educator development to discuss key issues related to promoting educator diversity. The events are designed to lift effective practices and obtain additional insights from participating educators and organizations about how to elevate educator diversity in our nation's schools. ""To Raise the Bar for learning conditions in our schools, we must make sure every student in every community has equitable access to outstanding educators who represent the diversity of the communities they serve and are well-supported, well-prepared, and fully empowered to lead in the classroom,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""Both of these events will provide educators, school leaders, and state and local officials with opportunities to share new and exciting ways to grow the workforce with additional diverse and talented educators. The Biden-Harris Administration will continue to work with state and local leaders to invest in our educators and provide students with the rich learning experiences and academically rigorous education they deserve."" Launched in March 2014, Teach to Lead was designed and led by teachers. To date, 18 summits have taken place all over the nation supporting 453 teacher leadership projects. To create systemic and sustained change, Teach to Lead involves and encourages collaboration among stakeholders at every level of education. Teach to Lead is a partnership of the Department, the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development (ASCD) and Teach Plus. Teach to Lead envisions a world in which teachers are valued as the foremost experts in instruction, and as such, are leaders of informing, developing, and implementing education policy and practice to steer systematic improvements to benefit student learning. Over 180 diverse Supporting Organizations that also believe the power of teacher leadership and innovation are part of the effort. This announcement comes as Secretary Cardona is embarking on his ""Back to School Bus Tour 2023: Raise the Bar"" featuring stops in Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. Throughout this week, Secretary Cardona, Deputy Secretary Cindy Marten, and Under Secretary James Kvaal will join national, state, and local school leaders to speak with students, parents, and educators for events that celebrate the back-to-school season and underscore the Administration's commitment to helping students recover from the impacts of the pandemic and continue on the road to success. As part of the bus tour, Administration officials will highlight academic and mental health programs and efforts to recruit and support educators funded by President Biden's American Rescue Plan, which provided historic resources to K-12 schools, colleges, and universities to reopen schools and help students of all ages recover. The Department remains committed to ensuring qualified teachers are in schools and continues to prioritize teacher diversity in the workforce. The Department recently released a policy brief, Raise the Bar: Eliminating Educator Shortages through Increased Compensation, High-Quality and Affordable Preparation and Teacher Leadership, that highlights how states nationwide are taking strategic steps outlined by the Biden-Harris Administration to support the effective recruitment, preparation, and retention of teachers. The pandemic resulted in the loss of 730,000 jobs, or 9 percent, of all local public education jobs from February to May of 2020. While recovery has varied by state, as of June, at the national level there are now only 1.2 percent fewer individuals working in local public education than before the pandemic. The Department will issue additional guidance later this year on its work to increase the diversity of our educator workforce and to address particularly high-need shortages areas. To date, the Department has announced new awards totaling more than $45 million to support teacher diversity and recruitment efforts, including: $18 million for the Augustus F. Hawkins Centers of Excellence Program grants to increase high-quality teacher preparation programs for teachers of color, strengthen the diversity of our teacher pipeline, and address teacher shortages $14.5 million in Teacher Quality Partnership grants to improve the quality of prospective and new teachers, including by improving educator preparation programs and supports for new teachers $12.7 million in Supporting Effective Educator Development funds to support the implementation of evidence-based practices that prepare, develop, or enhance the skills of educators. These grants also will enable recipients to develop, expand, and evaluate practices that can serve as models to be sustained, replicated, and scaled and include career advancement opportunities for current teachers. Conference on Equity in Opportunity The Department is hosting the first Conference on Equity in Opportunity, Oct. 26-27 in Denver. This event will bring together researchers, practitioners, and policy leaders to discuss priorities for a diverse workforce in education, identify hurdles to making a diverse workforce a reality, disseminate and amplify effective practices, and share information about grant funding to increase equity and access to funding opportunities. The conference seeks to foster thoughtful conversations around how to ensure that every student has access to outstanding, well-prepared, well-supported educators who reflect the diversity of the students they serve. Information on how to register for the conference can be found here. Powered by Teach to Lead Summit The Department is hosting the next Teach to Lead Summit on Oct. 27 in Denver. Teach to Lead Summits are regional convenings to spotlight and advance teacher-led work across the country. During the Teach to Lead Summit, teams of educators will collaborate to develop approaches to investing in a talented and diverse teacher pipeline using practices such as partnerships with Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Minority-Serving Institutions, and Hispanic-Serving Institutions; improving the work environment to support educator well-being; or supporting educator development to improve student learning.

30-Aug-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-approves-72-million-borrower-defense-discharges-over-2300-borrowers-who-attended-ashford-university,"Biden-Harris Administration Approves $72 Million in Borrower Defense Discharges for over 2,300 Borrowers who Attended Ashford University","The Biden-Harris Administration today announced the approval of $72 million in borrower defense to repayment discharges for more than 2,300 students who applied for relief from loans they took out to attend Ashford University (Ashford), which was an online for-profit school based in San Diego. The approvals come from a review by the U.S. Department of Education (Department) of evidence presented by the California Department of Justice during a successful lawsuit brought against Ashford and its parent company, Zovio, Inc. (Zovio), which resulted in a judgment against both entities in March 2022. Based upon evidence presented in that lawsuit, which covered the period from March 1, 2009, through April 30, 2020, the Department concluded Ashford and Zovio made numerous substantial misrepresentations during that period that borrowers relied upon to their detriment. The approved claims are from borrowers who enrolled in Ashford during this period and filed applications for borrower defense with allegations corroborated by these findings. “As the California Department of Justice proved in court, Ashford relied extensively on high-pressure and deceptive recruiting tactics to lure students,” said U.S. Under Secretary of Education James Kvaal. “Today we are protecting the students who were cheated by Ashford, and we will also hold the perpetrators accountable, protect taxpayers, and deter future wrongdoing.” The Department will also review the evidence to examine whether members of Ashford’s management and leadership took actions that violated Federal laws or regulations and threatened the integrity of the federal student financial aid programs. If the evidence shows they did, the Department may pursue appropriate remedies to enforce those rules. “What Ashford University did to its students was unconscionable and illegal. That’s why the California Department of Justice took Ashford and its parent company to court. Ultimately, we prevailed, securing more than $22 million in penalties,” said California Attorney General Rob Bonta. “I want to thank the Biden-Harris Administration for changing the lives of thousands of former Ashford students today. They have lived a nightmare for too long. I encourage other individuals who took out federal student loans to attend Ashford, and were subject to its deceptive or misleading tactics, to apply for relief from the U.S. Department of Education as soon as possible.” In 2017, the California Department of Justice brought a lawsuit against Ashford and Zovio (which at the time was known as Bridgepoint Education) arguing that the for-profit college and its leadership engaged in numerous practices that misled and deceived prospective Ashford students. That suit led to an 18-day trial that featured nearly two dozen witnesses and more than 1,500 exhibits, plus additional written depositions. On March 3, 2022, the court ruled in favor of the California Department of Justice, concluding that Ashford made more than 1.2 million misleading representations nationwide to prospective students and assessing a civil penalty of $22.3 million. As the decision said, the “Court heard substantial evidence that over the last decade, Defendants created a high-pressure admissions department whose north star was enrollment numbers.” It found that “admissions counselors would cross a ‘gray line’ ethically or ‘do things they wouldn’t normally do’ to boost numbers to keep their jobs.” The court found executives’ testimony that Ashford “always put students first” lacked credibility. In fact, the court described a “paper trail [showing] that company executives were well aware of [the admissions department’s] fear-based culture.” The penalty assessed is the subject of an ongoing appeal, but Zovio did not challenge the court’s findings about the underlying conduct. As established by the court and verified through the Department’s independent review of the evidence, Ashford and Zovio engaged in extensive substantial misrepresentations: Ashford recruiters told students they would be able to work as teachers, social workers, nurses, or drug and alcohol counselors. But Ashford never obtained the necessary state approval and/or accreditation for students to enter these professions, meaning students wasted years of their lives and incurred tens of thousands of dollars of debt for degrees they could not use. Ashford recruiters also lied about the cost to attend Ashford, the amount and type of financial aid students would receive, and the amount of debt students would accumulate. For instance, before they had access to borrowers’ financial aid award information some recruiters told prospective students that they would not incur out-of-pocket costs, that every Ashford student qualified for Federal Pell Grants, or that loan payments would be $50–$75 per month. Borrowers later discovered these promises were untrue when, for example, they unexpectedly reached lifetime loan limits during their enrollment, unexpectedly incurred out-of-pocket costs, and were forced to withdraw with debt but no degree. Ashford recruiters misled students about how long it would take to obtain an Ashford degree by stating its bachelor’s programs were “accelerated” or by comparing Ashford’s bachelor’s programs to traditional four-year schools when, in fact, Ashford’s bachelor’s degree programs were structured to take five academic years to complete. Ashford recruiters misled students about the ability to transfer credits both into Ashford and out of Ashford. Recruiters told students that Ashford would accept previously earned credits, reducing the amount of time and money students would spend completing their degrees. Students would later learn only some of the promised credits actually transferred. Ashford recruiters also promised students that the credits they earned at Ashford would transfer to other universities, when this was not always true. Borrowers relied upon these substantial misrepresentations to their detriment. Only 25 percent of students graduated from Ashford within 8 years of enrolling and borrowers in their applications described the inability to obtain employment, unexpected financial burdens, and an inability to complete their programs. The evidence from the California case also demonstrated that three-quarters of all Ashford bachelor’s degree programs would have resulted in a negative value for students, making the education they obtained effectively worthless. The Department approved these findings prior to July 1, 2023, and this action covers loans under the 1995 or 2016 regulation, as applicable. Three years into the California lawsuit, on Aug. 3, 2020 , the University of Arizona announced a plan for its affiliated foundation to acquire Ashford University and turn it into the University of Arizona Global Campus (UAGC). The University of Arizona acquired direct ownership of UAGC at the end of June 2023. Borrowers will not have to make any payments on the loans being discharged. The Department will email borrowers who qualified for a borrower defense discharge in September that their applications have been approved. Borrowers will see any remaining loan balances for federal loans zeroed out and credit trade lines deleted. Any payments those borrowers made to the Department on their federal student loans will be refunded. Separately, the Department intends to initiate a recoupment proceeding at a later date to seek repayment of the liabilities associated with these approved claims. As with other recent discharge approvals, today’s announcement continues to demonstrate the importance for taxpayers and students of a strong partnership between the Department and state attorneys general. The Department congratulates the California Department of Justice for its successful litigation of this case against an incontrovertibly predatory institution. The Department also thanks the offices of the Iowa and North Carolina Attorney General for the helpful information they provided. Borrowers who attended Ashford during this period, were harmed by these misrepresentations, and have not yet applied for borrower defense can visit StudentAid.gov/borrower-defense to submit a claim. Unwavering commitment to relief The Department remains steadfast in its commitment to use all available tools to deliver students, borrowers, and their families the relief they are entitled to under applicable law. Including today’s announcement, the Department has approved $14.8 billion in relief for 1.1 million borrowers whose colleges took advantage of them or closed abruptly. Overall, the Administration has approved debt relief for more than 3.4 million people and over $116 billion in loan discharges. This includes fixes to ensure that borrowers get relief promised by Congress through income-driven repayment programs, Public Service Loan Forgiveness, and discharges for borrowers with a total and permanent disability. The Department is also continuing a rulemaking process to provide further student loan relief to borrowers."

The Department is seeking nominations from 14 different constituency groups for the Student Loan Relief committee, which will meet for three virtual sessions beginning October 10. ""When the Supreme Court ruled against the Biden-Harris Administration’s student debt relief plan, we did not waste a moment opening up a new pathway to debt relief,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""As we pursue debt relief through this process, one of the most important steps is bringing together diverse perspectives to help us craft the strongest possible regulations for borrowers. The Student Loan Relief committee will include students, borrowers, state officials, civil rights advocates, representatives from colleges and universities, and other stakeholders so we can make sure all voices are heard and the needs of borrowers are fully considered.” These nominations are the second step in a process known as “negotiated rulemaking,” which is required under the Higher Education Act for any regulations related to the Federal student financial aid programs. This process started with a public hearing held by the Department on July 18 and a request for public comments, which solicited more than 24,000 responses. Next, negotiators selected by the Department will meet virtually on October 10-11, November 6-7, and December 11-12 to discuss ideas for regulatory reform. Sessions will be open to the public and include opportunities for public comment. The Department is seeking negotiators representing the following categories, each of which will include a primary and alternate representative: Four spots for current students and student loan borrowers based upon the level of program attended. The Department is particularly interested in a variety of experiences with student loans and postsecondary education, including attending different types of institutions, receiving a Pell Grant, and borrowing a Parent PLUS loan. Four spots for different types of institutions of higher education, including Historically Black Colleges and Universities and minority serving institutions. Two spots for State officials and Attorneys General. Two spots for civil rights organizations and legal assistance organizations. One spot for a U.S. military service member or veteran. One spot for a representative from the Federal Family Education Loan program. The Department will publish proposed rules for the public to comment on in the months following the conclusion of negotiations. We will then consider public comment and produce final regulations next year. Nominations can be sent to negregnominations@ed.gov and must include clear information about the nominee, their constituency group, resume and experience, and contact information. Any nomination must be received by September 14, 2023. Please see an official copy of the Federal Register Notice here for additional details on requirements for nominees. The Department will provide updated information on this negotiated rulemaking committee on an ongoing basis here .

OCR determined that the district discriminated against students based on sex by failing to respond to incidents of sexual harassment and assault and that it failed to coordinate its responses through its designated Title IX coordinator, among other Title IX violations. Specifically, OCR found that the district failed to investigate confirmed Title IX concerns about employees sexually harassing students and deferred its Title IX obligations to respond to such harassment to a state agency for several years without ensuring those obligations were met. In addition, OCR found that the district repeatedly failed to respond to incidents of student-to-student sexual harassment and to address the effects of such harassment on targeted students, did not take sufficient steps to prevent recurrence of harassment, and failed to provide adequate notice of the investigation outcomes to targeted students and their parents. OCR also found that the Title IX coordinator did not, and currently does not, coordinate the district’s efforts to comply with its responsibilities under Title IX. As a result, the district has no system in place to monitor whether its schools’ responses to reports of sexual harassment and assault complied with Title IX requirements or to identify emergent patterns or systemic problems by school or districtwide. OCR determined that the district did not consistently notify employees, students, and their parents of its designated Title IX coordinator and that the district does not discriminate on the basis of sex, as required by the Title IX regulations. Additionally, OCR determined that the district failed to adopt and implement grievance procedures that complied with the prior Title IX regulations and that the district’s grievance procedures did not comply with the 2020 Amendments to the Title IX regulations from August 2020 until August 2023. Finally, OCR identified concerns with the district’s recordkeeping system to track incidents of sexual harassment across schools. The district agreed to resolve the Title IX violations and concerns that OCR identified in a resolution agreement to ensure nondiscrimination on the basis of sex in its schools. “Newark Public Schools did not meet its Title IX obligations to protect its students from sexual harassment, including from district employees, but has now committed to robust resolution terms to provide the safe and nondiscriminatory learning environment that Title IX has promised all students,” said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon. The resolution includes: Ensuring that the Title IX coordinator coordinates all of the district’s efforts to comply with Title IX moving forward, including but not limited to all district investigations of sexual harassment involving its students and employees. Developing a program to assess the effectiveness of the district’s Title IX anti-discrimination efforts. Revising Title IX policies and procedures to comply with the Title IX regulations. Training staff and students regarding the district’s Title IX procedures, how to identify what constitutes sexual harassment, and how to report such harassment. Maintaining required records regarding reports of sexual harassment. Reviewing case files for reported incidents of employee-to-student and student-to-student sexual harassment from school years 2017-2018 through 2021-2022 to determine if further action is needed to provide an equitable resolution of each incident. Disseminating a notice of nondiscrimination that complies with Title IX. And, Administering an annual school climate survey to district employees and students to evaluate the climate at each district school with respect to sexual harassment and identify needed responsive steps for OCR review and approval. The letter to Newark Public Schools District is available here , and the resolution agreement is available here ."
28-Aug-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-highlights-efforts-support-k-12-education-students-go-back-school,FACT SHEET: Biden-Harris Administration Highlights Efforts to Support K-12 Education as Students go Back-to-School,"The President and First Lady will mark the start of the school year by visiting students at Eliot-Hine Middle School in Washington, D.C. When President Biden took office, less than half of K-12 students were going to school in person. Today, thanks to the President’s swift actions and historic investments, every school in America is open safely for in-person instruction. Since Day One, President Biden has worked to help every school open safely for in-person instruction, accelerate academic achievement, and build communities where all students feel they belong. The actions the President has taken to support schools and the students they serve, include: Securing the Largest Investment in Public Education in History to Help Students Get Back to School and Recover Academically: COVID-19 created unprecedented challenges for kids, from school closures to lost instructional time and social isolation from their peers. To support the immediate response and the long-term recovery work our students need, the President secured $130 billion through the American Rescue Plan (ARP) to help schools safely reopen, stay open, and address the academic and mental health needs of students. ARP funding has put more teachers in our classrooms and more counselors, social workers, and other staff in our schools; is providing high-quality tutoring; supporting record expansion of summer and after-school programming; supporting HVAC improvements within school buildings to address air quality and environmental and safety needs in aging school buildings; and providing a wide range of student supports. Compared with the pre-pandemic period, as of the end of last year school year, the number of public school social workers is up 39% and the number of public school nurses is up 30%. Nearly half of school districts using these funds to expand summer learning programs have shown clear gains in math. While we have further to go, we are seeing increased evidence of improvement, including several states returning to pre-pandemic levels of achievement on their state math and literacy assessments. Expanding Access to Mental Health Support in Schools Across the Country: Students around the nation continue to grapple with mental health challenges. Rates of depression, anxiety, and feelings of hopelessness were already on the rise, but unprecedented disruptions in their school and social lives in the past years, have exacerbated these concerns. That’s why the President named tackling the mental health crisis, particularly among America’s young people, a top priority. Last year, the President signed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA) into law last year as the first major federal gun safety bill passed in nearly 30 years. BSCA included historic levels of funding to address youth mental health, including $2 billion for the Department of Education (ED) to create safe, inclusive learning environments for students and hire and train more mental health professionals for schools—where students are most likely to receive these crucial services. ED has awarded $286 million to date across 264 grantees in 48 states and DC to support mental health services in schools—investments that are estimated to support more than 14,000 new mental health professionals in schools in the coming years. ED is also working closely with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to further extend the reach of federal mental health programs and investments into schools, and to leverage Medicaid funding to provide crucial health and mental health services at schools. Earlier this year, the Administration released comprehensive guidance to make it easier for schools to bill Medicaid, including proposing a rule that would streamline Medicaid billing permissions to deliver mental health services to students. The Administration also launched a technical assistance center to help schools take advantage of this crucial funding stream—which supported an additional investment of more than $6 billion in schools in 2022. Expanding Community Schools that Improve Academic Success: Meeting the needs of the whole child is essential to help America’s students grow academically and improve their well-being. That’s why the President is committed to increasing and supporting the adoption of community school models across the country. Full-Service Community Schools leverage local non-profit, private sector, and public partnerships to bring wraparound services into school buildings, such as health services, and assistance with shelter and nutrition. Research has shown that these schools contribute to increased student attendance, on-time grade progression, and high school graduation. Because of the President’s commitment to this model, federal funding for this model has increased five-fold over the course of this Administration. While the program supported 170 schools before 2021, it is now reaching more than 1,700 schools serving almost 800,000 students. Additionally, agencies across the federal government have also identified the ways that additional resources can support the expansion of this model and further integrate wraparound supports into our schools. Expanding Teacher and Staff Capacity by Bringing in Tutors and Mentors: To provide students with the support they need to recover from the impacts of the pandemic, the President issued a call to action to bring 250,000 more tutors, mentors and other critical supports into schools over three years. Last summer, ED, AmeriCorps, and the Johns Hopkins University’s Everyone Graduates Center launched the National Partnership for Student Success (NPSS), a public-private partnership to accomplish this goal. To support this effort, ED recently launched a call to action to colleges, encouraging them to devote a greater share of their Federal Work-Study funds to bring college students into K-12 schools as tutors and in other high-impact roles. Early adopters include more than two dozen colleges ranging from large public university systems, like the State University of New York, to Howard University and Hispanic-Serving Institutions. In the coming weeks, NPSS will highlight progress towards the President’s goal during the 2022-2023 school year. Growing an Effective Teacher and School Leadership Workforce: From February to May 2020, communities lost 730,000 local public education jobs during the pandemic—a 9% decline in local public education employment—including teachers, specialized instructional support personnel, and other critical staff. As of June 2023, local public education employment has increased by 635,000 jobs since its low point in May 2020. This significant rebound now means that there are now only 1.2% fewer individuals working in local public education than before the pandemic; this progress has been significantly fueled by investments in educators through ARP and other Administration investments. The President has prioritized building an effective, diverse teacher pipeline, including by expanding high-quality and affordable programs that prepare and support teachers, including teacher Registered Apprenticeships. Registered Apprenticeship can be an effective, high-quality “earn and learn” model that allows prospective teachers to earn their credential while earning a salary by combining coursework with structured, paid on-the-job learning experiences with a mentor teacher. The Administration has worked closely with States to grow the number of registered apprenticeship programs for teachers from 2 to 23, with bipartisan governors across the country scaling this effective model. ED has also advanced teacher diversity by including priorities focused on educator diversity in 14 grant programs, totaling over $470 million and funding; for the first time, funding a teacher preparation program for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Tribal Colleges or Universities (TCUs), and Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) to help accelerate the pace of preparing teachers of color for America’s schools. ED’s Raise the Bar Policy Brief highlights progress by states across the country, with the support of the Administration, in advancing key strategies to eliminate educator shortages in the long term. Directing Resources to Historically Underserved Schools and Students: The President’s leadership has garnered substantial increases for Federal student support programs to meet the needs of historically underserved students. The President has secured a nearly $2 billion (or 11%) increase in Title I funds, which delivers critical resources to 90% of school districts across the nation and helps them provide students in low-income communities with necessary academic opportunities and supports. Additionally, the President has secured a historic $1.3 billion (or 10%) increase in Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) funds, which helps states support special education instruction and services for 7.4 million students with disabilities, and increased funding by $92 million for programs that support English learners. The Administration has also increased funding to support subpopulations of students, including Alaska Native Education and Native Hawaiian Education programs which have increased by over 20%."

The week-long, multi-state road trip will showcase the many ways schools, families, and communities are doubling down on accelerating student learning and raising the bar in education. The “Back to School Bus Tour 2023: Raise the Bar” will feature stops in Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. “This year’s Back to School Bus Tour will demonstrate how states, districts, schools and higher education institutions, with strong support and investment from the Biden-Harris Administration, are already working boldly and creatively to Raise the Bar for education in our country – from fostering academic recovery to investing in mental health supports, strengthening and supporting the educator workforce to expanding out-of-school time programs, and building new career pathways to efforts to increase college access and affordability,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “To serve our nation’s students well for years to come, we need to see pockets of excellence in some places become systems of success in all places. I’m looking forward to lifting up great models in education and highlighting how our country benefits when we work together to invest in our children and young people – the future of our nation.” Secretary Cardona will kick off the tour in Kansas where he will focus on pressing issues in education including growing teacher diversity, access to higher education, online connectivity, and family engagement. On day two, Secretary Cardona will continue in Missouri and Illinois where he will connect with K-12 schools, out-of-school time providers, and higher education institutions in various settings, focusing on how school districts, rural communities, and HBCUs are using historic pandemic relief funds to strengthen core instruction and provide well-rounded educational opportunities in order to help students exceed and thrive in their education, and how schools are using Medicaid funding to provide access to school-based mental health. Later in the week, Secretary Cardona will be in Wisconsin where he will highlight the impact of high school career pathways programs on student success. This visit comes on the heels of the Department’s Unlocking Pathways Summit series which consisted of four regional education-workforce convenings to highlight workforce priorities and opportunities for young people that are growing due to recent federal investments, like the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Inflation Reduction Act and CHIPS and Science Act . This includes expanding access to high-wage, high-demand pathways and skills-based learning opportunities, including Registered Apprenticeships and community college programs, in sectors like advanced manufacturing, clean energy, infrastructure, and cybersecurity. The tour will end in Minnesota where he will lift up ways that school districts continue to use American Rescue Plan (ARP) funds to support the academic recovery and mental health supports of students, ahead of the school year. Over the last two years, schools have invested billions of ARP dollars and additional funds through the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA) to help students catch up academically, expand access to mental health supports, and hire more high-quality educators. Throughout the week, Secretary Cardona, Deputy Secretary Cindy Marten, and Undersecretary James Kvaal, will join national, state, and local school leaders to speak with students, parents, and educators for events that celebrate the back-to-school season and underscore the Administration’s commitment to helping students recover from the impacts of the pandemic and continue on the road to success. As part of the “Back to School Bus Tour 2023: Raise the Bar,” Administration officials will highlight academic and mental health programs and efforts to recruit and support educators funded by President Biden’s ARP, which provided historic resources to K-12 schools, colleges, and universities to reopen schools and help students of all ages recover. Preliminary details about bus tour activities are listed below. Additional information and exact timing for each site will be released the day prior to the tour stop. Many of the events will include a press availability with Secretary Cardona and local leaders. To RSVP for stops on the tour, please email pressRSVP@ed.gov .

Betty McCollum Biden-Harris Administration Actions to Prepare for a Safe and Successful School Year Since Day One, the Biden-Harris Administration has taken bold action to get schools back open safely amidst a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic and provide states, school districts, and colleges and universities the resources they need to help students recover academically and thrive. When President Biden took office, less than half of K-12 schools were open for in-person learning. Within three months, President Biden had signed the historic ARP, providing $170 billion in funds for K-12 schools, colleges, and universities to reopen safely, stay open, and put students on the pathway to recovery and success. Over the last two years, schools have invested billions of ARP dollars to help students catch up academically, expand access to mental health supports, and hire more high-quality educators, and today, all schools are safely open for in-person learning and students nationwide are on the path to academic recovery. The Biden-Harris Administration also launched efforts to expand access to effective academic and mental health supports in K-12 schools, including: Launched the National Partnership for Student Success. Through NPSS, ED and partners are leading strategic efforts to recruit 250,000 new tutors and mentors to help catch up academically and thrive. Launched the Engage Every Student Initiative to help communities use ARP funds, alongside other state and local funds, to ensure that every child who wants a spot in a high-quality, out-of-school time program has one, whether through a high-quality summer or afterschool program. Awarded over $2 billion in BSCA funding to expand vital mental health services and provide additional support for states and districts to design and enhance initiatives that will promote safer, more inclusive, and positive school environments for all students, educators, and school staff. Provided technical assistance to states, including dozens of fact sheets, FAQs , Dear Colleague Letters , webinars , and other guidance to elevate evidence-based interventions and practices to help students accelerate their learning, and to make clear how federal resources can support these practices. This includes launching the Raise the Bar: Best Practices Clearinghouse , which includes hundreds of evidence-based examples of how schools are using ESSER funds to support academic and mental health recovery and how school leaders and communities across the country can leverage these funds."
24-Aug-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-educations-office-civil-rights-issues-resource-race-and-school-programming,U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights Issues Resource on Race and School Programming,"Today, the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) released a Dear Colleague Letter (DCL) on Race and School Programming to guide schools on lawful programs to promote racially inclusive school communities. This resource clarifies the circumstances under which schools can – consistent with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its implementing regulations – develop curricula and programs or engage in activities that promote racially inclusive school communities. Title VI, a law enforced by OCR, prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national origin in programs or activities receiving federal financial assistance, including public schools serving students in pre-K through grade 12 and colleges and universities. “Today’s resource shares with school communities practical guidance about whether and when federal civil rights laws permit – and in some cases require – schools to take actions related to race, as well as whether and when these same laws may require that schools not act based on race,” said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon. “This resource aims to assist our nation’s schools to fulfill Congress’ longstanding promise that no student experience discrimination based on race.” The DCL includes hypothetical examples to help schools assess their Title VI legal obligations and protections concerning school-sponsored curricula and programming. This resource clarifies circumstances under which schools may be in violation of Title VI when they separate students based on race or treat individual students or groups of students differently based on race. It clarifies that schools may also violate Title VI when they create, encourage, accept, tolerate, or fail to correct a racially hostile educational environment. Additionally, the DCL underscores that Title VI generally does not restrict schools from holding assemblies, meetings, focus groups, or listening sessions that relate to students’ experiences with race in their school or community. The resource also states that school-sponsored or recognized groups or programs with a special emphasis on race, such as a student club or mentorship opportunity, that are open to all students, typically do not violate Title VI simply because of a race-related theme. This letter follows the release of a January 2023 OCR Diversity & Inclusion Activities Under Title VI fact sheet that confirmed for educators, parents, and students that diversity, equity, and inclusion training and similar activities generally are consistent with Title VI. OCR is available to provide technical assistance to institutions, organizations, and members of the public that request assistance in complying with any aspect of the civil rights laws OCR enforces, including those issues addressed in the resource. If individuals within a school community have questions or would like technical assistance, they may contact the OCR office serving their state or territory by visiting https://ocrcas.ed.gov/contact-ocr ."
24-Aug-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-takes-action-against-five-schools-disbursing-federal-student-aid-students-enrolled-unaccredited-programs,U.S. Department of Education Takes Action Against Five Schools for Disbursing Federal Student Aid to Students Enrolled in Unaccredited Programs,"Today, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) announced settlement agreements with five law schools after a Federal Student Aid (FSA) investigation revealed that the schools improperly disbursed Title IV funds to students enrolled in unaccredited Master of Laws (LL.M.) programs. The five schools that settled these claims are Albany Law School, Atlanta’s John Marshall School of Law, Brooklyn Law School, New England Law–Boston, and New York Law School. Nearly $2.9 million in ineligible disbursements were made to 92 students across the five schools between July 2017 and June 2022. “Today’s actions demonstrate our commitment to protect the integrity of the federal student aid programs,” said FSA Chief Operating Officer Richard Cordray. “Through our ongoing work, we will continue to protect both students and taxpayers.” Generally, institutions must be accredited or, in the case of public or non-profit institutions, pre-accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting agency to participate in Title IV programs. Each school is responsible for ensuring Title IV funds are only disbursed to students enrolled in eligible programs within the scope of the Department’s recognition of the school’s institutional accrediting agency. Accreditation is a critical part of the federal student aid program’s regulatory framework, and accrediting agencies serve as reliable authorities regarding the quality of education or training offered by the institutions or programs they accredit. Unlike most law schools in the United States, the schools included in the settlements are not part of a broader university system that offers other non-legal education programs and has institutional accreditation. Such schools are sometimes referred to as “freestanding law schools.” The American Bar Association (ABA) typically functions as a programmatic accreditor for schools with Juris Doctor (J.D.) programs that otherwise have institutional accreditation; however, the ABA does not accredit LL.M. programs. For freestanding law schools, the ABA is recognized as an institutional accreditor by the Department and, therefore, approved as a gatekeeper for Title IVfunds for J.D. programs only. As a result, freestanding law schools institutionally accredited by the ABA that offer non-J.D. programs, such as LL.M. programs, must also secure institutional accreditation that has within its recognized scope all the programs the school offers for Title IV aid. FSA’s investigation determined that the five law schools failed to secure the necessary accreditation to disburse aid for their LL.M. programs. Under the settlements, the schools will: Reimburse the expected loss to the Department from the improperly disbursed funds; Stop disbursing federal student aid funds to students in ineligible programs; and Agree not to seek reimbursement or to recoup the amounts paid as a settlement from any students or former students. Under the settlements, the three schools that disbursed Title IV funds within the last five years must pay a fine. The agreements do not constitute an admission of wrongdoing or liability by the schools. These are not the first instances of an ABA-accredited law school coming under Department scrutiny for disbursing Title IVfunds to students enrolled in an unaccredited LL.M. program. In October 2021, another freestanding law school notified the Department of its own violation. The Department opened a program review and assessed liabilities against the school for improper disbursements. In that case, however, the Department determined not to impose a fine on that school in recognition of the school’s responsible conduct in self-identifying and self-reporting this violation. Schools are responsible for ensuring they have institutional accreditation recognized by the Department, including any program for which they intend to disburse Title IV funds. The Department will continue to hold schools accountable if they fail to fulfill this responsibility."
23-Aug-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/statement-us-secretary-education-miguel-cardona-transformation-and-decentralization-plan-puerto-rico-department-education,Statement from U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona on the Transformation and Decentralization Plan for the Puerto Rico Department of Education,"U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona today released the following statement on the Initiative for Decentralization of Education and Autonomy of Regions (IDEAR)’s recommendations and plan for the transformation of the Puerto Rico Department of Education (PRDE): “This plan is an important step in raising the bar to provide students, teachers, school leaders, and families in Puerto Rico with the education system they deserve. The recommendations presented set the course for a transformed system that will ensure resources get directly to school communities and that decisions are made at the local level. “Parents, teachers, and students have been clear: They want their voices to be heard, their needs to be considered, and to keep politics out of the classroom. We know from similar efforts that decentralization, done well, can enable central office staff to focus on their jobs; it can help principals and teachers focus on their schools; and it can provide students with a better shot at learning. “The Biden-Harris Administration looks forward to supporting Puerto Rico as it implements these recommendations.”"
22-Aug-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-launches-most-affordable-repayment-plan-ever-transforming-income-driven-repayment-cutting-undergraduate-payments-half-and-preventing-unpaid-interest-accumulation,"Biden-Harris Administration Launches Most Affordable Repayment Plan Ever, Transforming Income-Driven Repayment by Cutting Undergraduate Payments in Half and Preventing Unpaid Interest Accumulation","The Biden-Harris Administration today announced that it has fully launched its updated income-driven repayment application tool on StudentAid.gov and that student loan borrowers can now officially enroll in the Saving on A Valuable Education (SAVE) plan, the most affordable repayment plan ever created. The plan is part of President Biden and Vice President Harris' broader efforts to make college more affordable and support students and borrowers. Already, the Biden-Harris Administration has approved the cancellation of more than $116 billion in student loan debt for 3.4 million borrowers – and the new SAVE plan will save millions of borrowers money on their monthly payments. Additionally, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) is announcing a nationwide outreach campaign called ""SAVE on Student Debt"" in collaboration with leading grassrootsorganizations. ""SAVE on Student Debt"" will leverage strategic partnerships across public, private, and nonprofit sectors to support borrowers by ensuring they take full advantage of the benefits provided by the SAVE plan in addition to the existing resources and debt forgiveness programs available from the Department. ""Starting today, millions of borrowers can reduce their monthly student loan bills by enrolling in the SAVE plan, the most affordable repayment plan in history,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""The SAVE plan is another huge step forward in President Biden's tireless efforts to fix the broken student loan system, reduce the burden of student debt on working families, and put borrowers first. SAVE isn't just about helping borrowers today, it's about creating a more affordable pathway for millions of aspiring students who dream of earning college degrees and achieving the American dream—that's exactly what the Biden-Harris Administration has fought to do since day one."" ""The SAVE plan is a sea change for students, making college loans far more affordable than ever before,"" said Under Secretary James Kvaal. ""It will cut payments to zero for borrowers making roughly $15 an hour, save all other borrowers at least $1,000 a year compared to other income-driven repayment plans, and stop runaway interest that leaves folks owing more than their initial loan. We are launching the 'SAVE on Student Debt' campaign in partnership with leading grassroots groups across the country to help as many borrowers as possible enroll in the SAVE plan and get additional support and resources for their federal loans."" Under the SAVE plan, a single borrower who makes less than $15 an hour will not have to make any payments, and borrowers earning above that amount would save more than $1,000 a year on their payments compared to other IDR plans. The SAVE plan also ensures that borrowers never see their balance grow due to unpaid interest as long as they keep up with their required payments. Additionally, the new IDR application takes just 10 minutes or less to complete, and it allows borrowers to choose to have their income accessed securely from the Internal Revenue Service and automatically recertified every year, so most do not need to reapply annually. This new feature will prevent borrowers from missing their required annual IDR recertification. Borrowers applying for the SAVE plan will see their new payment amount before submitting their application, and it will be displayed on their servicer's website when their first bill is sent. Most borrowers who apply for the SAVE plan in the coming days can expect to have their new monthly payment amount for their first payment in October. After borrowersapply, they can check the status of their application by visiting their account dashboard on StudentAid.gov. Borrowers who are currently enrolled in the REPAYE plan will automatically have their monthly payments adjusted to the new SAVE plan before payments restart. In the coming days, the Department and our servicers will reach out directly to nearly 30 million borrowers to invite them to use the new IDR application to apply for the SAVE plan. This is part of the Department's robust outreach campaign to provide information and resources to borrowers to support them when the payment pause ends this fall. The Department has already been in direct touch with 43 million borrowers and will continue to coordinate with servicers and outside partners to provide additional high-quality communications with specific, actionable information directly to borrowers. Estimated benefits of the SAVE Plan The benefits of the SAVE plan will be particularly critical for low- and middle-income borrowers, community college students, and borrowers who work in public service. Overall, the Department estimates that the plan will have the following effects for future cohorts of borrowers compared to the REPAYE plan: More than 1 million additional low-income borrowers will qualify for a $0 payment. 70% of borrowers who were on IDR plan before the payment pause would stand to benefit from the SAVE plan's new provision that borrowers who pay what they owe on this plan will no longer see their loans grow due to unpaid interest. Borrowers will see their total payments per dollar borrowed fall by 40%. Borrowers with the lowest projected lifetime earnings will see payments per dollar borrowed fall by 83%, while those in the top would only see a 5% reduction. A typical graduate of a four-year public university will save nearly $2,000 a year. A first-year teacher with a bachelor's degree will see a two-third reduction in total payments, saving more than $17,000, while pursuing Public Service Loan Forgiveness. 85% of community college borrowers will be debt-free within 10 years. On average, Black, Hispanic, American Indian and Alaska Native borrowers will see their total lifetime payments per dollar borrowed cut in half. Leveraging Strategic Partnerships to Support Borrowers and Promote SAVE Plan To help ensure borrowers are able to take full advantage of resources available from the Department, the Biden-Harris Administration is launching a nationwide outreach campaign called ""SAVE on Student Debt"" in partnership with leading grassroots organizations. This public-private partnership builds upon the robust direct outreach underway from Federal Student Aid and loan servicers by leveraging strategic partnerships across public, private, and nonprofit sectors to support borrowers and ensure they take full advantage of the benefits provided by the SAVE plan. This partnership will be led by the Department in collaboration with Civic Nation, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the National Urban League (NUL), Rise, the Student Debt Crisis Center, UnidosUS, and Young Invincibles. To support borrowers and ensure the millions of Americans who can benefit from the SAVE plan are enrolled, the Department and their campaign partners will hold a SAVE on Student Debt Week of Action in September, which will include the following actions: Civic Nation will engage its nationwide network of community-based organizations to facilitate enrollment in the SAVE plan and will host a relational organizing training to empower individuals to share information about the SAVE plan with their friends, family, and communities. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) will mobilize their young advocates to assist borrowers enrolling in the SAVE plan, and will host briefing and trainings for members at state conventions this fall. The National Urban League will host an event for its nationwide movement of affiliates – including affiliate CEOs, members of the Urban League Young Professionals, and Urban League Guild members – that will cover upcoming changes for student loan borrowers. Rise will reach out to its community of 250,000 students, alumni and supporters by hosting phonebanks, textbanks, and in-person and virtual townhalls across 100+ college campuses to share how the SAVE plan will directly impact borrowers and their communities. The Student Debt Crisis Center will reach out to its two million supporters to host workshops and will train their ambassador network on peer-to-peer outreach around the SAVE plan. UnidosUS will mobilize its national network of affiliates, allies, and supporters through a targeted social media campaign to ensure the Latino community is aware of the SAVE plan and other student loan resources. Young Invincibles will provide timely and accurate information to young adults about the SAVE plan by hosting townhalls and information sessions, virtually and in-person, and will continue to amplify young adult voices and experiences about the enrollment process. If an organization is interested in participating in the SAVE on Student Debt Week of Action, they can sign up at SaveOnStudentDebt.org. Building on an Unparalleled Record of Debt Relief The SAVE plan builds on the work the Biden-Harris Administration has already done to improve the student loan program, make higher education more affordable, and approvemore than $116 billion in targeted relief for 3.4 million student loan borrowers, including: $39 billion for 804,000 borrowers through fixing historical inaccuracies in the IDR payment count system for borrowers who earned forgiveness; $45.7 billion for 662,000 public servants through improvements to PSLF; $10.5 billion for 491,000 borrowers who have a total and permanent disability; and $22 billion for nearly 1.3 million borrowers who were cheated by their schools, saw their schools precipitously close, or are covered by related court settlements. The Biden-Harris Administration remains committed to making college more affordable and ensuring student debt is not a roadblock to attaining a college degree or credential, or planning for the future. The Administration has made the largest increase to Pell Grants in a decade and has charted a course to double the maximum Pell Grant and make community college free to enhance college affordability and reduce unnecessary student debt. The Administration is also holding institutions accountable for unaffordable debts, and recently proposed regulations that would set standards for earnings and debt outcomes for career program while enhancing transparency for all programs to give students the information they need to make informed choices."
21-Aug-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-educations-office-civil-rights-announces-resolution-sexual-assault-and-disability-discrimination-investigation-pflugerville-independent-school-district-texas,U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights Announces Resolution of Sexual Assault and Disability Discrimination Investigation of Pflugerville Independent School District in Texas,"Today, the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) announced that the Pflugerville Independent School District in Texas entered into a resolution agreement to address the district's handling of a sexual assault case and to ensure compliance with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. The resolution also covers additional issues raised under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. OCR determined that the district violated Title IX by failing to respond equitably to notice that a student was sexually assaulted by another student in a school restroom in the 2018-2019 school year. “The Pflugerville Independent School District’s response to an allegation that one of its students raped another of its students in a school bathroom violated Title IX, not only because it relied on stereotypes about how a person should respond to sexual assault but also because it failed to provide fair process both to the accused student and to his accuser,” said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon. “The district has committed that it will follow the law in Title IX going forward, in addition to providing all students with disabilities the necessary services to meet their individual educational needs. While local law enforcement had asked the district to temporarily take no action to investigate while law enforcement conducted its criminal investigation, the district never undertook a Title IX investigation even after the completion of law enforcement activities. When the district eventually retained a third-party investigator to conduct “a review of the administrative procedures followed in an alleged sexual incident,” the third-party investigator did not conduct an equitable investigation as required by Title IX. The investigator reported to OCR that she interviewed only the student who alleged she had been raped, and no one else, because – based on the student’s responses to questions about the alleged incident and her physical demeanor – the investigator did not think the assault happened. As a result, the investigation failed to provide the accused student an opportunity to be heard regarding the allegation, failed to interview relevant witnesses, and failed to make a determination as to whether the student was subjected to a hostile environment. Notwithstanding these flaws, the school district’s Title IX coordinator – whom the district had detailed to other duties and who had not participated in the investigation – adopted the third-party investigator’s findings and issued a notice of outcome that also failed to comply with Title IX because it did not provide the accused student with notice of the outcome of the investigation. OCR also found that the district violated Section 504 and Title II, during the 2018-2019 school year, by failing to provide the student about whom the complaint to OCR was filed with a disability accommodation in a class as required by the student’s Section 504 plan. Finally, OCR had a compliance concern regarding whether the district afforded the student a required accommodation for a state-mandated end-of-course exam. The district agreed to take specific actions to resolve this investigation and signed an agreement memorializing that commitment. The agreement, when fully implemented, will resolve the Title IX, Section 504, and Title II violations and compliance concerns. The resolution agreement provides that the district will: (1) offer to meet with the student who reported the assault and her family to discuss the district’s handling of the sexual assault allegation and offer reimbursement for the student’s related counseling expenses; (2) designate a Title IX coordinator; (3) conduct training on Title IX and Section 504/Title II for relevant district and school staff; (4) provide OCR with information and documentation regarding sexual harassment complaints received in the 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 school years; (5) develop and disseminate a sexual harassment climate survey to the school’s students, with OCR review and approval of responsive district actions; and (6) develop and implement a record-keeping system to preserve all sexual harassment complaints and related documentation.

17-Aug-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-launches-schoolsafetygov-awareness-campaign-support-schools-safety-resources,Biden-Harris Administration Launches SchoolSafety.gov Awareness Campaign to Support Schools with Safety Resources,"WASHINGTON – Today, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), in partnership with the U.S. Departments of Education (ED), Health and Human Services (HHS), and Justice (DOJ), launched a public awareness campaign to highlight federal school safety resources and evidence-based practices available through SchoolSafety.gov . The initiative is one of several new actions the Biden-Harris Administration is taking to support safer schools and communities. Through the campaign, the Administration will educate school administrators and personnel, teachers, parents and guardians, and state and local government officials about school safety resources available at SchoolSafety.gov. The goal is to advance the mission and maximize the benefits of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA) by accelerating and enhancing the implementation of programs and initiatives that will help families, communities, and schools build capacity and establish and expand successful school safety strategies. The campaign is being launched for the back-to-school season to ensure schools have the tools they need to create and sustain welcoming, safe, and supportive learning environments for students and educators. “Government has few responsibilities more important than ensuring the safety of our communities – especially our children. To protect our children and educators, we must ensure the schools they attend and work in are safe and secure,” said Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas. “The Department of Homeland Security and our partners in the Biden-Harris Administration are working together to make sure every child and educator enjoys the safe and secure environment they deserve, whether it is by making available safety resources to every school through SchoolSafety.gov, cutting through red tape to help schools access critical security funding, or supporting local law enforcement agencies across the country.” “Student and educator safety remains our priority. I want all school and district leaders, educators and staff, and students and families to know that SchoolSafety.gov is the one-stop shop for accessing resources and evidence-based approaches for building safe schools and positive learning environments,” said U.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona. “We’re pairing the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act’s historic investments in school safety and student mental health and wellbeing with easily accessible information on everything from responding to cyber bullying and preventing violence to improving emergency preparedness and accessing federal grants. The Department of Education and our partners across the Biden-Harris Administration want every school’s back-to-school season to be one of joy, possibility, and safety.” “We must do everything we can to keep our schools and kids safe. SchoolSafety.gov is a tremendous resource that education and community members can use to support safe positive environments for all students and educators,” said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra. “We are honored to partner with the Departments of Education, Justice, and Homeland Security to raise awareness of this terrific resource.” “The SchoolSafety.gov initiative is aimed at harnessing resources and capabilities across government to help make every school a safe place to learn,” said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. “The Justice Department will continue to work closely with our partners in government and communities across the country to help keep our schools safe.” As part of the campaign, SchoolSafety.gov will release a range of resources, including a video, communications toolkit, and infographics, to help schools learn more about how to enhance school safety, access support, and easily share information about the campaign with others in their community. The campaign will feature an informational webinar being held and recorded today showcasing federal training and technical assistance centers focused on issues related to school safety, school climate, and mental health supports. Campaign information and materials will be accessible through a dedicated hub on SchoolSafety.gov throughout August and September. SchoolSafety.gov is the public website of the Federal School Safety Clearinghouse, an ongoing and collaborative effort among ED, DHS, DOJ, and HHS to enhance school safety through a whole-of-government approach. Through the site, the American public and school communities can access hundreds of resources and evidence-based practices to enhance school safety, which can be used to help inform and support school safety plans, programs, and initiatives within individualized and unique school settings. These resources address a range of issues and elements critical to school safety and include information on bullying prevention, student mental health support and services, school climate, emergency planning, and preventing acts of targeted and community violence. SchoolSafety.gov also includes several easy-to-use tools to help schools discover specific resources and create and implement comprehensive and holistic safety programs, including a feature that makes it easier to locate and identify available federal school safety funding opportunities and grant programs. BSCA enacted several key provisions to enhance school safety and security initiatives and is part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s broader commitment to making our students, schools, and communities safer. Under the Luke and Alex School Safety Act, which is incorporated into BSCA, the law formally established the Clearinghouse and required it to identify and publish online through SchoolSafety.gov evidence-based practices and recommendations to improve school safety for use by states, local educational agencies, institutions of higher education, state and local law enforcement agencies, health professionals, and the general public.

14-Aug-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-begins-discharges-804000-borrowers-39-billion-automatic-loan-forgiveness-result-fixes-income-driven-repayment-plans,"Biden-Harris Administration Begins Discharges for 804,000 Borrowers with $39 Billion in Automatic Loan Forgiveness as a Result of Fixes to Income-Driven Repayment Plans","The U.S.Department of Education today announced that automatic discharges will begin for 804,000 borrowers who qualify for $39 billion in student loan relief as a result of fixes to income-driven repayment (IDR) plans implemented by the Biden-Harris Administration since April 2022. In total, the Biden-Harris Administration has approved more than $116 billion in student loan forgiveness for more than 3.4 million borrowers. “Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is beginning to discharge loans for 804,000 borrowers who never received the forgiveness they rightfully earned through decades of payments,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “We are standing up for borrowers who did everything right, but whose progress toward forgiveness went uncounted due to past administrative failures that the Biden-Harris team has worked tirelessly to correct. From day one, President Biden has focused on fixing the broken student loan system, and we will not back down or give an inch when it comes to fighting for debt relief for working families.” The discharges are a result of fixes implemented by the Biden-Harris Administration to ensure all borrowers have an accurate count of the number of monthly payments that qualify toward forgiveness under IDR plans. These fixes, which are the implementation of the payment count adjustment announced by the Administration in April 2022, are part of the Department’s commitment to address historical failures in the federal student loan program. These failures caused qualifying payments made under IDR plans that should have moved borrowers closer to forgiveness to go unaccounted for. Borrowers are eligible for forgiveness if they have accumulated the equivalent of either 20 or 25 years of qualifying months. Borrowers will be notified directly by their servicers via email when their loans have been discharged, and all qualifying loans will be discharged over the coming weeks. In addition to President Biden’s unparalleled record on providing debt relief to millions of Americans, the Administration has also taken steps to help borrowers access affordable payments going forward. The Department recently issued final regulations creating the most affordable payment plan ever—the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan. The SAVE plan will cut payments on undergraduate loans in half compared to other IDR plans, ensure that borrowers never see their balance grow as long as they keep up with their required payments, and protect more of a borrower’s income for basic needs. A single borrower who makes less than $15 an hour will not have to make any payments. Borrowers earning above that amount will save more than $1,000 a year on their payments compared to other IDR plans. Benefits from the SAVE plan will start becoming available this summer.

President and Fellows of Harvard College and Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. University of North Carolina et al. (collectively “ SFFA ”). These resources will help colleges and universities as they work to lawfully pursue efforts to achieve a student body that is diverse across a range of factors, including race and ethnicity. “For higher education to be an engine for equal opportunity, upward mobility, and global competitiveness, we need campus communities that reflect the beautiful diversity of our country,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “The resources issued by the Biden-Harris Administration today will provide college leaders with much-needed clarity on how they can lawfully promote and support diversity, and expand access to educational opportunity for all following the Supreme Court’s disappointing ruling on affirmative action. This is only the first step and our Administration will continue to work to ensure we prepare students of all backgrounds and income levels to lead our multiracial democracy together.” “Ensuring access to higher education for students from different backgrounds is one of the most powerful tools we have to prepare graduates to lead an increasingly diverse nation and make real our country’s promise of opportunity for all,” said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. “These resources provide universities with the information they need to determine what lawful tools remain available to them to promote diversity in higher education. The Justice Department remains committed to working with our partners across government to advance educational opportunity for all Americans, regardless of their background.” On June 29, 2023, the Supreme Court held in SFFA that the consideration of race in the admissions practices of the University of North Carolina and Harvard College violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, a law that prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national origin in programs or activities receiving federal financial assistance, including those conducted by colleges and universities. Following the Court’s decision in SFFA, President Biden and Vice President Harris called on colleges, universities, and other stakeholders to seize the opportunity to expand access to educational opportunity for all students, and to build diverse student bodies, including by recognizing and valuing students who have overcome adversity. The Administration remains committed to advancing access to education for all Americans and to promoting diversity in higher education consistent with the law. The Administration has taken swift action to support our Nation's colleges and universities so they can continue building pathways to upward mobility and preparing students from all backgrounds to thrive in our workforce. In light of the SFFA decision, the Departments today issued a Dear Colleague Letter and a Questions and Answers resource to help colleges and universities understand the Court’s decision as they continue to pursue campuses that are racially diverse and that include students with a range of viewpoints, talents, backgrounds, and experiences. “Even after the Court’s decision sharply limited a tool that colleges and universities with selective admissions practices have used to create vibrant, diverse campus communities, colleges and universities may still lawfully work to admit, support, retain, and graduate racially diverse student bodies,” said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights at ED Catherine E. Lhamon. “Today’s resources explain practices that remain legally viable and confirms the Federal government’s robust civil rights protections in schools.” “Educational institutions must ensure that their admissions practices do not create barriers for students based on any protected characteristics, including race. We remain firmly committed to equitable educational opportunities for all students, and ensuring that students of color are not denied opportunities to participate in the robust exchange of ideas and experiences that are the keystone of college and university life,” said Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Kristen Clarke. “How an applicant’s racial identity – as well as other aspects of their social identity – impact their development, goals, or educational interests remain important considerations in university admissions.” The Departments’ Questions & Answers resource distills the Court’s core holding and offers examples of steps colleges and universities can lawfully take to achieve a student body that is diverse across a range of factors, including race and ethnicity, such as: targeted outreach, recruitment, and pathway programs; evaluation of admission policies; and retention strategies and programs. Last month, following the decision, ED hosted the National Summit on Equal Opportunity in Higher Education that brought together senior Biden-Harris Administration officials, student leaders, college and university administrators, and other stakeholders to discuss innovative strategies that enable colleges and universities to promote educational opportunity. In September, ED will produce a report elevating promising practices to build inclusive, diverse student bodies, including how colleges can give serious consideration to measures of adversity when selecting among qualified applicants. This includes accounting for the financial means of a student or their family; where a student grew up and went to high school; and personal experiences of hardship or discrimination, including racial discrimination, in their admissions process.

4-Aug-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/department-of-education-announces-k-12-cybersecurity-resilience-efforts,U.S. Department of Education Announces Key K-12 Cybersecurity Resilience Efforts,"As students, educators, and families prepare for back-to-school, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) today announced key K-12 cybersecurity resilience efforts. These efforts include the upcoming establishment of a Government Coordinating Council (GCC), as well as the release of the Department’s three K-12 Digital Infrastructure briefs, including “ K-12 Digital Infrastructure Brief: Defensible and Resilient "", which was co-authored by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). Together these efforts, along with a Back to School Safely: Cybersecurity Summit for K-12 Schools at the White House today , will unite leaders from the Biden-Harris Administration, education, industry, and advocacy groups to make advancements on a crucial issue in fortifying cybersecurity resilience in the K-12 education community. You can watch today’s White House event here. “Let’s face it: in today’s digital age, our students and their teachers will increasingly use technology in the classroom. Schools have access to more devices and connectivity than ever before, and this technology in education has incredible potential to help students better connect with their learning and achieve, and teachers better engage with their students,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “But to make the most of these benefits, we must effectively manage the risks. Just as we expect everyone in a school system to plan and prepare for physical risks, we must now also ensure everyone helps plan and prepare for digital risks in our schools and classrooms. The Department of Education has listened to the field about the importance of K-12 cybersecurity, and today we are coming together to recognize this and indicate our next steps.” Education infrastructure is undeniably critical infrastructure, and in the digital age, the need to prioritize cybersecurity has become more apparent than ever. Just as we work to provide physical infrastructure for our schools that is safe, healthy, and supportive for all students, the time has come to align resources towards creating a digital infrastructure that is equally safe, accessible, resilient, sustainable, and future-proof. The Government Coordinating Council will coordinate activities, policy, and communications between federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial governments that strengthen the cyber defenses and resilience of K-12 schools. By facilitating formal, ongoing collaboration between all levels of government and the education sector, the GCC will be a key first step in the Department’s strategy to protect schools and districts from cybersecurity threats and for supporting districts in preparing for, responding to, and recovering from cybersecurity attacks. This convening at the White House will play a pivotal role in defining the strategies and approaches required to achieve these crucial objectives. “Students across our country deserve to learn in an environment that is not only safe and secure physically, but also digitally. This means that schools need the best tools and information available to protect their networks and systems from the full range of cybersecurity threats,” said CISA Director Jen Easterly. “The product released today from the Department of Education and CISA provides school K-12 districts across our communities a starting place to understand the importance of securing our digital infrastructure, and provides steps schools can take today to keep their systems safe. CISA encourages all Administrators, school districts, and teachers to read through this helpful guide and take the recommended actions to reduce risk to the digital infrastructure our children use and rely on each and every day.” The White House’s Back to School Safely: Cybersecurity Summit for K-12 Schools will serve as an important platform to address the pressing challenges faced by educators, students, and families in the digital realm. Participants will discuss the key considerations outlined in the newly released publication by the Department's Office of Educational Technology and CISA titled ""K-12 Digital Infrastructure Brief: Defensible and Resilient."" Key considerations include: Enhancing Continuous Risk Management: Addressing the ever-evolving threat landscape by adopting a proactive approach to managing cybersecurity risks. Utilizing Analogies for Understanding: Leveraging lessons from physical world scenarios to comprehensively grasp and tackle cybersecurity challenges. Prioritizing and Implementing Mitigation Strategies: Identifying the most critical risks and applying effective mitigations such as multi-factor authentication, robust password policies, phishing prevention, and regular software updates. Building Resilience for Cyber Incidents: Developing and practicing cyber incident response plans to minimize the impact of potential cybersecurity breaches. Vendor Engagement for Enhanced Security: Encouraging vendors to invest in secure design principles, obtain cyber risk assurance certifications, and establish security vulnerability disclosure practices. The additional two K-12 Digital Infrastructure briefs being released by the Department today include “ Adequate and Future-Proof ” and “ Privacy-Enhancing, Interoperable and Useful .” The White House’s Back to School Safely: Cybersecurity Summit for K-12 Schools represents a unique opportunity for collaboration, innovation, and partnership, aimed at safeguarding the digital infrastructure that supports our nation's schools. Together, we can create a more secure and resilient future for education in the United States. For more information, visit tech.ed.gov/infrastructure."

The grants, which will provide nearly $100 million for transformational infrastructure investments and evidence-based strategies for improved student outcomes for underserved students, follow more than $25 billion in funding to HBCUs, MSIs, and TCCUs through the Department since President Biden took office. Specifically, this consists of $7.3 billion in cumulative investments for 98 HBCUs, $474.5 million to 35 TCCUs, and $18.1 billion to support MSIs. “At a time when diversity in higher education is under attack, it’s never been more important to invest in our nation’s Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal Colleges and Universities, Minority-Serving Institutions, community colleges, and other inclusive institutions,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “These grant programs represent opportunities for our nation’s most inclusive and diverse colleges and universities to expand their capacity to drive research and innovation and strengthen evidence-based supports that help underserved students successfully complete their degrees and build brighter futures. The Biden-Harris Administration will continue working to raise the bar for excellence and equity in higher education and invest in institutions committed to helping students of all backgrounds and income levels reach their potential and pursue their dreams.” Historically Black Colleges or Universities, Tribally Controlled Colleges or Universities, and Minority-Serving Institutions Research and Development Infrastructure Grant Program The Historically Black Colleges or Universities, Tribally Controlled Colleges or Universities, and Minority-Serving Institutions Research and Development Infrastructure Grant Program (RDI) will provide $50 million to HBCUs, TCCUs, and MSIs to implement transformational investments in research infrastructure, including research productivity, faculty expertise, graduate programs, physical infrastructure, human capital development, and partnerships leading to increases in external funding. For HBCUs and MSIs, the grant will support institutions in increasing their level of research activity in alignment with the Carnegie Classification designations to move from the Doctoral and Professional Universities (D/PU) classification toward the Doctoral Universities with High Research Activity (R2) classification, or from the Doctoral Universities with High Research Activity (R2) classification towards the Doctoral Universities with Very High Research Activity (R1) classification. For TCCUs, which have their own Carnegie Classification designation and cannot be classified as R1, R2, or D/PU, the funds will support an increase in research activities, undergraduate research opportunities, faculty development, research development, and infrastructure, including physical infrastructure and human capital development. The Postsecondary Student Success Grant Aligned with the goals in the Department’s Raise the Bar Initiative, the Postsecondary Student Success Grant (PSSG) application is now open to institutions to support underserved students. The PSSG grant aims to equitably improve postsecondary student outcomes, including retention, transfer, credit accumulation, and completion, by leveraging data and implementing, scaling, and rigorously evaluating evidence-based activities to support data-driven decisions and actions by institutional leaders committed to inclusive student success. Many students of color and with low incomes still face barriers to successfully enrolling in and completing college, and as the number of non-traditional students in postsecondary education increases, additional and different supports are required to enable students to successfully complete their credentials. This grant program will provide $45 million to fund evidence-based strategies that result in improved student outcomes for underserved students. The competition will consider applications in two tiers—early phase and mid-phase/expansion—based upon the amount of existing research validating their effectiveness. More information on how to apply for the PSSG grant can be found here ."

27-Jul-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/education-labor-departments-announce-new-efforts-to-advance-teacher-preparation-programs-and-expand-registered-apprenticeships-educators,"Education, Labor Departments Announce New Efforts to Advance Teacher Preparation Programs and Expand Registered Apprenticeships for Educators","The U.S. Departments of Education and Labor today announced a series of new efforts to expand Registered Apprenticeships for educators and invest in teacher preparation programs. These efforts advance a key focus area of the Department of Education’s Raise the Bar: Lead the World initiative to boldly improve learning conditions by eliminating educator shortages and build on a joint letter sent by the Secretaries of Education and Labor last summer, which called on state education and workforce leaders to take action to address educator shortages. Today’s announcement includes: New National Guidelines for Apprenticeship Standards (NGS) for Registered Apprenticeships for K-12 teachers developed by The Pathways Alliance; More than $27 million from the Department of Education to support educator preparation programs; More than $65 million from the Department of Labor to develop and scale Registered Apprenticeship programs in critical sectors across 45 states—with 35 targeting education; The Department of Labor is announcing a new industry intermediary to launch, promote and expand Registered Apprenticeship programs for K-12 educators; and A policy brief authored by the Department of Education that highlights how states are taking strategic steps outlined by the Biden-Harris Administration to support the effective recruitment, preparation, and retention of teachers. “Teacher apprenticeships are a key strategy in our plan to Raise the Bar in education and improve learning conditions in our schools by ending the educator shortage and providing all students with great teachers who are prepared to succeed in the classroom from day one,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “Providing opportunities for future teachers to earn while they learn has created an affordable and exciting pathway into the teaching profession that can help states build a talented and diverse pipeline of educators at a moment when doing so has never mattered more. I’m thrilled that in just one year, the Biden-Harris Administration has helped grow the number of states with Registered Apprenticeship programs for teachers from two to 21, and look forward to these new guidelines helping get all 50 states get onboard.” “The Department of Labor’s investments will enable states to strengthen educator pipelines and create pathways to opportunity through a proven earn-as-you-learn model of Registered Apprenticeships,” said Acting U.S. Secretary of Labor Julie Su. “This important partnership with the U.S. Department of Education advances the Biden-Harris Administration’s whole-of-government approach to building a highly-skilled, diverse workforce that is reflective of the communities that teachers serve.” “We are grateful to the Departments of Labor and Education and all of our partner organizations for their leadership and partnership in developing these apprenticeship standards,” said Erin Mote from The Pathways Alliance. “More than just guidelines, these standards represent our collective commitment to nurturing a preparation pipeline that supports broad access to high-quality preparation and champions diversity and inclusivity for educators.” National Guidelines for K-12 Teacher Registered Apprenticeships: The newly released National Guidelines for Apprenticeship Standards (NGS) for Registered Apprenticeships for K-12 teachers was developed by The Pathways Alliance and approved by the Department of Labor. The NGS can guide states, school districts, and other apprenticeship sponsors to align their programs to quality standards for K-12 teachers. It also provides a framework that partners can use to develop state specific program standards and provide for expedited development and approval of new apprenticeship programs. The Pathways Alliance NGS working group included the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education, National Education Association, American Federation of Teachers, Learning Policy Institute, National Association of Workforce Boards, National Center for Grow Your Own, National Center for Teacher Residencies, Arizona State University, Cooperative Educational Service Agency 6, Deans for Impact, InnovateEDU, Inspire Texas, Prepared To Teach, Substantial, and TeachMe Education. Department of Education Investments: The Department of Education also released a policy brief, Raise the Bar: Eliminating Educator Shortages through Increased Compensation, High-Quality and Affordable Preparation and Teacher Leadership, that highlights how states nationwide are taking strategic steps outlined by the Biden-Harris Administration to support the effective recruitment, preparation, and retention of teachers. The pandemic resulted in the loss of 730,000 jobs, or 9 percent, of all local public education jobs from February to May of 2020. While recovery has varied by state, as of June, at the national level there are now only 1.2 percent fewer individuals working in local public education than before the pandemic. The Department of Education also announced new awards totaling more than $27 million to support these efforts, including: $14.5 million in Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) grants. These awards are intended to improve the quality of prospective and new teachers by improving educator preparation programs and supports for new teachers. $12.7 million in Supporting Effective Educator Development (SEED) funds to support the implementation of evidence-based practices that prepare, develop, or enhance the skills of educators. These grants also will enable recipients to develop, expand, and evaluate practices that can serve as models to be sustained, replicated, and scaled and include career advancement opportunities for current teachers. Eighteen states have participated in a learning series led by the Department of Education that is supporting state education, educator preparation, and labor organization leaders in planning, designing, and implementing teacher Registered Apprenticeship Programs for K-12 teachers as a long-term strategy for strengthening and diversifying the teacher workforce. Registered Apprenticeships are a valuable tool in addressing the teacher shortage and the NGS released today will help expand the number of states with high-quality programs. These programs can be effective, high-quality “earn and learn” models that allow candidates to earn their teaching credentials through structured, paid on-the-job learning experiences with mentors, combined with coursework, and can be used to bring to the table additional resources to support the expansion of teacher residency and Grow-Your-Own programs. By reducing the cost of earning a license and offering flexible scheduling, these programs open the doors to the profession to those who may otherwise face barriers, including teachers of color and individuals such as paraprofessionals who may already have decades of experience in the classroom, but previously did not have an affordable pathway to become a teacher. Department of Labor Investments: The Department of Labor also announced the award of over $65 million in formula and competitive grants to 45 states and territories to develop and scale registered apprenticeship programs in education and other critical sectors. Thirty-five of the 45 states and territories that received formula funds under this program identified the education sector as one of their targeted sectors. DOL made competitive awards to Kansas, Utah, North Dakota, Washington, and New Hampshire to support the expansion of Registered Apprenticeship Programs for K-12 teachers, as well as other sectors prioritized by these grantees. Furthermore, the Department of Labor is announcing a new Registered Apprenticeship industry intermediary, RTI International, that will specifically focus on launching, promoting, and expanding Registered Apprenticeship programs in K-12 education."
26-Jul-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-educations-office-civil-rights-resolves-sexual-harassment-compliance-review-garland-independent-school-district-texas,U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights Resolves Sexual Harassment Compliance Review of Garland Independent School District in Texas,"Today, the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) resolved a compliance review of the Garland Independent School District in Texas with a resolution agreement to address the district’s handling of sexual assault cases, including those involving student and staff misconduct. OCR determined the district violated Title IX by routinely delaying its investigation of Title IX complaints when law enforcement was involved, and, in some instances, failing ever to conduct a Title IX investigation and instead relying on law enforcement findings. Abdicating its responsibility to law enforcement in this way left the district without information it needed to evaluate what Title IX steps may be necessary in each case. The evidence in investigation revealed shockingly inadequate district responses under Title IX. In one incident, school video footage reflected a student forcing another student to perform a sex act. While the harassing student was arrested and charged with felony rape, the district’s file showed no evidence that the district provided a prompt and equitable Title IX response to the harassed student, such as by providing her support or assessing and addressing the impact the harassment had on her. In another case, OCR’s investigation revealed that the district inexplicably waited 26 days after completing an investigation – until after law enforcement arrested the harassers – to discipline two male students who harassed and assaulted two female students daily over several weeks. OCR found that 42 of the 48 student-involved files reviewed contained no evidence that the district considered, offered, and/or provided interim supportive measures to the allegedly harassed student at any juncture of the Title IX process. OCR additionally determined the district failed to issue a notice of nondiscrimination that fully complied with Title IX and OCR had concerns regarding the district’s lack of a centralized system for tracking and maintaining Title IX complaint files, which resulted in significant gaps in its recordkeeping and hampered the district’s ability to coordinate Title IX compliance. OCR identified additional concerns that the district failed to provide adequate Title IX training for its Title IX coordinator, administrators and staff; that the Title IX coordinator’s ability to coordinate the district’s efforts to comply with its Title IX responsibilities was compromised because the Title IX coordinator held multiple positions in the district; and that the district’s grievance procedures were unclear regarding its appeal process. The resolution agreement commits the district to take the following steps to resolve this investigation: Reviewing and revising its Title IX grievance procedures and its notice of nondiscrimination, to ensure compliance with the Title IX regulation. Developing and implementing a centralized record-keeping system and procedures that adequately and accurately document and preserve all complaints of sexual harassment and sexual assault. Providing OCR with information regarding the district’s processing of each formal complaint of sexual harassment and sexual assault filed with the district during the 2022-2023, 2023-2024, and 2024-2025 school years, to include how the district responds to all such complaints. Providing training on Title IX and its revised grievance procedures to district staff. Providing age-appropriate student training districtwide regarding sexual harassment, including sexual assault, including how and to whom to report sexual harassment. Developing and conducting a climate survey of its students and staff regarding sexual harassment, including sexual assault, with OCR review and approval of responsive district action following the survey. “Students in Garland Independent School District deserve the safety and freedom from discrimination that Congress promised them in Title IX,” said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon. “The Office for Civil Rights will continue to be here for them, monitoring the school district in the coming years to be sure it complies with Title IX.” The letter to Garland Independent School District is available here and the resolution agreement is available here ."
25-Jul-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-approves-130-million-group-discharge-7400-borrowers-colorado-locations-collegeamerica-0,"Biden-Harris Administration Approves $130 Million Group Discharge for 7,400 Borrowers from Colorado Locations of CollegeAmerica","The Biden-Harris Administration today announced it will deliver $130 million in automatic relief to 7,400 students who enrolled at Colorado-based locations of CollegeAmerica between Jan. 1, 2006, and July 1, 2020. The U.S. Department of Education (Department) found that CollegeAmerica’s parent company, the Center for Excellence in Higher Education (CEHE), made widespread misrepresentations about the salaries and employment rates of its graduates, the programs it offered, and the terms of a private loan product it offered. The Department used evidence provided by Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, who led a multi-year investigation and lawsuit against CEHE and its leadership. Borrowers will receive this relief regardless of whether they have filed a borrower defense to repayment application. Today’s action is yet another result of the strong partnership between the Department and state attorneys general, whose investigations and lawsuits focused on wrongdoing by predatory schools, have helped deliver billions of dollars in relief to affected student loan borrowers. The Biden-Harris Administration has approved $14.7 billion in relief for 1.1 million borrowers whose colleges took advantage of them or closed abruptly. This includes giving hundreds of thousands of borrowers a fresh start from loans taken out at Corinthian Colleges and ITT Technical Institute. The Department also issued a new, stronger borrower defense regulation that gives borrowers a fairer path to a discharge when their college took advantage of them. Overall, the Biden-Harris Administration has approved more than $116 billion in relief to over 3.4 million borrowers under President Biden’s leadership. “This announcement means a clean slate for thousands of students hurt by CollegeAmerica’s widespread misconduct,” said the Department’s Federal Student Aid Chief Operating Officer Richard Cordray. “The close partnership between the Department of Education and Attorney General Weiser’s office made this action possible. We will continue to work to deliver targeted student loan relief to borrowers whose schools take advantage of them.” “I applaud the Department of Education for providing much-deserved relief to the many Coloradans who were mistreated by CollegeAmerica,” said Colorado Attorney General Weiser. “CollegeAmerica knowingly took advantage of students by luring them into high-priced, low-quality programs with promises of high-earning potential and job placement that it knew were not attainable. Protecting borrowers from predatory lending and helping Coloradans navigate through student loan burdens will continue to be a priority for our office.” Starting in 2012, the Colorado Attorney General investigated the practices of CEHE and its leadership in that state, which culminated in a 2017 bench trial, and a judgment in favor of the state in 2020. The Department had more than 300 trial exhibits, including internal policies, procedures, and emails that CEHE provided to its accreditor, ACCSC. The Colorado Attorney General's Borrower Defense application, which cited to the district court's 2020 opinion, helped point the Department to the most relevant evidence. The Department also reviewed testimony given under oath from 40 witnesses during the trial, including experts, former students, and CEHE officials. The Department reached its conclusions based on its independent review of the Colorado evidence, as well as information from other borrower defense applications. The Colorado CollegeAmerica campuses stopped enrolling new students in 2019 and closed by September 2020. CEHE closed all its remaining campuses in August 2021. Based on that evidentiary review, the Department concluded that CEHE engaged in the following pervasive and widespread misrepresentations over a multi-year period at the Colorado campuses of CollegeAmerica: From 2006 until 2020, CEHE prominently included in its admission and advertising materials that its graduates would earn high salaries. But the included data was misleadingly based on national averages. In fact, internal CEHE data showed Colorado CollegeAmerica campus graduates on average earned just $25,000 five years out of school, less than the salaries of high school graduates publicized by the school. From 2009 through 2012, and again in 2015, CollegeAmerica campuses in Colorado advertised inflated and falsified job placement rates of 70 percent, when internal figures showed the actual number was 40 percent. This included counting a business administration graduate working as a produce clerk and a medical specialties graduate working as a waiter as successful placements. From 2007 through 2017, CEHE falsely told students that its private loan product was “affordable,” when it knew that some years as many as 70 percent of CollegeAmerica borrowers enrolled in the Colorado campuses defaulted. Overall, more than 850 CollegeAmerica students had judgments filed against them by CEHE’s debt collectors. Starting in 2006 and continuing until 2014, CEHE lied to students of the Colorado CollegeAmerica campuses by telling them that it either offered certain programs or that a given offering would qualify the borrower for employment in a given field. For instance, from 2006 through 2012, CEHE claimed that a medical specialties program would allow students to obtain the certifications to become an X-ray technician, though the school did not even own any X-ray machines. The Department will begin notifying eligible borrowers in August that they are approved for discharges. Borrowers will see any remaining loan balances zeroed out and credit trade lines deleted. Any payments they made to the Department will be refunded. The Department invites more states to provide evidence of wrongdoing as Colorado did here to justify relief for students who were harmed. The borrower defense regulations that went into effect on July 1, 2023, include a specific process for states to use to submit group applications. The group application that state agencies and legal assistance organizations can use is available on StudentAid.gov. Unwavering commitment to relief The Biden-Harris Administration remains steadfast in its commitment to use all available tools to deliver promised relief to students, borrowers, and their families. Thus far, more than 3.4 million people have been approved for over $116 billion in loan discharges. The changes that the Administration has made include fixes to ensure that borrowers get relief promised by Congress through income-driven repayment programs, Public Service Loan Forgiveness, and discharges for borrowers with a total and permanent disability. This month, the Department also initiated a rulemaking process aimed at opening an alternative path to provide debt further relief to as many borrowers as possible, as quickly as possible."

The series is supported by the Departments of Commerce, Energy, Labor, and Transportation to increase and expand access to high-quality career pathways to help young Americans pursue jobs in today’s in-demand fields and be prepared for careers of the future. This summit series, co-hosted with the national education and workforce development organization Jobs for the Future (JFF), consists of four regional education-workforce convenings to highlight workforce priorities and opportunities for young people that are growing due to recent federal investments, like the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Inflation Reduction Act and CHIPS and Science Act . This includes expanding access to high-wage, high demand pathways and skills-based learning opportunities, including Registered Apprenticeships and community college programs, in sectors like advanced manufacturing, clean energy, construction, and cybersecurity. “From the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to the CHIPS and Science Act to the Inflation Reduction Act and beyond, President Biden’s Investing in America agenda will create millions of well-paying jobs in the coming years, and it’s on us to ensure students have pathways into these incredible career opportunities,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “Our Unlocking Pathways Summits will empower state and local leaders in K-12 and postsecondary education, government, and the private sector to Raise the Bar for career-connected learning that engages and supports our youth, meets America’s future workforce needs, and ensures our nation continues to lead the world. Our economy demands and our students deserve state and local leaders prepared to meet this moment.” Each Unlocking Pathways Summit will bring together leaders from education, workforce and industry from multiple states. This invite-only event is an opportunity for key decision makers to share critical strategies and address shared challenges in developing robust talent pipelines. Each state is sending a team spanning K-12 education, postsecondary education, workforce development, and employers to specifically re-imagine how that state’s education and workforce development planning can and should include young people. “JFF is honored to co-host this summer’s Unlocking Pathways Summits. Education-to-career pathways represent perhaps the most promising and bipartisan agenda in education over the last decade. Congress has recently appropriated billions of dollars that can accelerate and deepen this work,” said Maria Flynn, CEO and President of Jobs for the Future. “This is an historic opportunity to engage leaders from every state in the country in re-envisioning and redesigning education and workforce development systems, to invest in cross-sector collaboration, and ultimately to prepare the workforce needed to meet our country's economic imperatives.” The series will kick off today at Renton Technical College in Renton, Washington, and will be hosted in partnership with the Department of Transportation featuring construction and infrastructure pathway opportunities and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The Unlocking Pathways Summit series will continue over the summer in Aurora, Colorado, with the Department of Energy, featuring clean energy pathways and the Inflation Reduction Act; Madison, Wisconsin, with the Department of Commerce featuring CHIPS and Science Act; and in Biloxi, Mississippi, with the Department of Labor with a focus on technology and cybersecurity. The Summits complement the Biden-Harris Administration’s Workforce Hubs, which were launched earlier this year in an initial set of five cities that are seeing an influx of private and public investment, spurred by President Biden’s Investing in America agenda. The Hubs focus on bringing together industry, state, local, and national leaders, as well as community college and union partners to help more Americans of all ages and walks of life access the training and tools to fill good-paying jobs created as a result of the President’s economic agenda.

24-Jul-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-strengthens-guidance-improve-equal-educational-opportunity-children-disabilities,U.S. Department of Education Strengthens Guidance to Improve Equal Educational Opportunity for Children with Disabilities,"The U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP) today released updated policy guidance, which takes immediate effect, to ensure and strengthen the rights and protections guaranteed to children with disabilities and their families under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The guidance and accompanying Dear Colleague Letter address the IDEA’s “general supervision” requirement, which necessitates states monitor local educational agencies (LEAs) as required by IDEA Part B , and early intervention service (EIS) programs and providers as required by IDEA Part C to ensure children with disabilities and their families access their rights under IDEA. “As a former special education teacher, administrator, and state special education director, I’ve experienced implementation of IDEA’s general supervision requirements at the state and local level and recognize the need to fortify the policy guidance,” said Glenna Wright-Gallo, Assistant Secretary for the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitation (OSERS), under which OSEP sits. “We must continue to Raise the Bar for all children. One vital component of this effort is to ensure children with disabilities, birth through age 21, receive the early intervention services and a free appropriate public education (FAPE) that meets their unique needs and prepares them for further education, employment, and independent living.” OSEP’s updated guidance will: Provide states with accessible and actionable information necessary to timely identify and correct noncompliance; Help ensure the rights guaranteed under the IDEA to children with disabilities and their families are protected; and Reaffirm expectations across states to help ensure consistent implementation of IDEA. “While the federal government provides grants to states under IDEA, it is the state’s responsibility to educate students with disabilities in accordance with the law. This guidance underscores each state’s general supervision responsibility to meet the purpose of IDEA and ensure that all school-age children, regardless of the nature or severity of their disability, can access FAPE in the least restrictive environment and that infants and toddlers with disabilities and their families receive appropriate early intervention services to the maximum extent appropriate,” said OSEP Director Valerie C. Williams. Through various OSEP monitoring activities and information received in the State Performance Plan/Annual Performance Report (SPP/APR) submissions, OSEP has observed the need for updated guidance to ensure states have the information needed to build robust general supervision systems. Such systems should ensure statewide accountability that swiftly identifies and corrects noncompliance, increases accountability through the collection of timely and accurate data, and ensures the full implementation of IDEA to improve functional outcomes, and early intervention and educational results for children with disabilities. Additionally, OSEP received requests to clarify for all state education administrators the roles and responsibilities needed to satisfy the IDEA’s general supervision requirements. OSEP is further clarifying or expanding positions in the following areas: A state must not ignore credible allegations of noncompliance made outside its formal monitoring visit cycle; States must monitor each LEA or EIS program at least once within the six-year cycle of the state’s SPP/APR; States must issue a timely finding of noncompliance, generally within three months of the state’s identification of the noncompliance; and States, LEAs, and EIS programs or providers must verify the correction of each individual case of child specific identified noncompliance, rather than a subset."

The 2023 HBCU scholars are the largest cohort since the inception of this recognition program in 2014 and represent a record number of institutions, with the HBCU participation rate now over 70 percent. “Our 2023 HBCU Scholars are talented students who embody the culture of excellence and inclusion championed by our nation ’s Historically Black Colleges and Universities,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “On behalf of the U.S. Department of Education and everyone across the Biden-Harris Administration, I congratulate each of our 2023 HBCU scholars on this prestigious recognition and thank them for their commitment to serving their communities. I’m thrilled to see the HBCU Scholars program continue to expand its reach and provide such exciting professional development, networking, and educational opportunities to some of our nation’s brightest and most promising young leaders.” Currently enrolled at 70 of our nation’s HBCUs, this group of HBCU Scholars were selected from a competitive pool of over 300 applicants. Over the course of an academic school year, HBCU Scholars will serve as ambassadors of the White House Initiative on HBCUs, the U.S. Department of Education, and their respective HBCU. Furthering the mission to Raise the Bar , students in this program are encouraged to lift their communities, unite others around student success, work to strengthen our democracy, and grow our economy. HBCU Scholars will be offered professional and personal development, and cross-university networking opportunities with an opportunity to explore, discuss, and improve issues specifically related to the HBCU community. A critical component of the HBCU Scholar Program is a partnership with NASA to foster innovation and opportunity for the cohorts. This partnership with NASA makes the Minority University Research and Education Project (MUREP) Innovation Tech Transfer Idea Competition (MITTIC), “Mini MITTIC” part of the HBCU Scholar Program. Through the Mini MITTIC program, HBCU Scholars will partner with one another to developing ideas to commercialize technology derived from NASA intellectual property that can improve their campus and surrounding communities. HBCU Scholars will have the opportunity to present their IP ideas in-person at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland during the National HBCU Week Conference in September. “NASA’s MUREP is thrilled, once again, to engage with the White House Initiative on HBCUs to enhance the learning experience for this year’s cohort of White House Scholars,” said MUREP manager Torry Johnson. “We are looking forward to the new ideas that the Scholars develop at the MITTIC Hack-a-thon using NASA’s technology portfolio and our continued overall support of the HBCU community.” HBCU Scholars will also be invited to the 2023 HBCU Week National Annual Conference , which will be held on September 24-28, 2023, at the Hyatt Regency in Crystal City, Virginia. This year’s conference themes are, “Raising the Bar: Forging Excellence Through Innovation & Leadership.” During the conference, HBCU Scholars will participate in conference sessions designed to engage a spirit of innovation, leadership, and personal and professional development. Most importantly, HBCU Scholars will have opportunities to engage with one another, initiative staff and partners all to further showcase their individual and collective talent. Following the conference HBCU Scholars will be invited to participate in programs, event and monthly master classes that are designed to enhance HBCU Scholars professional development and create greater access to post-graduation opportunities within non-profit, business, and federal agency partners to ensure that as a nation we remain globally competitive. More information about the 102 HBCU Scholars’ activities will be provided in the coming months as they serve as ambassadors of the White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity through Historically Black Colleges and Universities.

19-Jul-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/secretary-cardona-congratulates-2023-presidents-education-awards-program-recipients,Secretary Cardona Congratulates 2023 President’s Education Awards Program Recipients,"U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona today congratulated the 2023 President’s Education Awards Program (PEAP) recipients, recognizing hundreds of thousands of elementary, middle, and high school graduates from public and private schools across all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Outlying Areas, and American military bases abroad on their educational accomplishments. From the opening of the program in March through close-out in the month of June, there have been more than 92,000 unique downloads of 2023 PEAP materials, including Excellence and Achievement certificates and letters from the President and the Secretary. “On behalf of President Biden and everyone at the U.S. Department of Education, I want to congratulate and celebrate the talented and hardworking students who have earned the 2023 President’s Education Award,” Secretary Miguel Cardona said. “This year’s awardees have shined academically, demonstrated determination and excellence, and inspired their educators, peers, and families with their strength of character. These remarkable young people are our nation’s future leaders, innovators, artists, and scholars, and their achievements bring all of us in the Biden-Harris administration tremendous hope and pride.” PEAP was founded in 1983. Every year since then, the program has provided schools with the opportunity to recognize graduating students who meet high standards of academic excellence and those who have given their best effort, often overcoming obstacles to their learning. Each year, eligible graduating K-12 students are selected by their school principals for recognition in one of two categories: The President’s Award for Educational Excellence – This award recognizes academic success in the classroom. To be eligible, students must meet requirements, including grade point average or other school-set criteria and choice of state tests or teacher recommendations. The President’s Award for Educational Achievement – This award recognizes students who show outstanding educational growth, improvement, commitment, or intellectual development in their academic subjects but do not meet the criteria for the Educational Excellence Award. Its purpose is to encourage and reward students who work hard and give their best effort, often in the face of obstacles. Criteria for this award are developed at each school. Individual recognition is bestowed by the President and the U.S. Secretary of Education, in partnership with the National Association of Elementary School Principals and the National Association of Secondary School Principals. The award includes a congratulatory letter to the student and a certificate signed by the President, the Secretary, and the school principal. Unlike other awards programs, the principal has sole discretion in choosing recipients based on eligibility. There is no limit on the number of awards that can be distributed, as long as students meet the criteria for each award set by the school. This year the agency again made available the Excellence and Achievement certificates, as well as congratulatory letters from the President and Secretary of Education, available digitally. Also, PEAP-related products, such as folders, pins, and graduation cords, remain available to order from the National Association of Elementary School Principals at https://www.services-naesp.org/peap/t-main.aspx ."

On Friday, the Department started notifying 804,000 borrowers who have a total of $39 billion in Federal student loans that will be automatically discharged in the coming weeks. Today’s data show how many borrowers and the total amount that is eligible for relief in each state and territory as a result of this action. Since the beginning of the Biden-Harris Administration, the Department has approved more than $116 billion in student loan forgiveness for more than 3.4 million borrowers. The discharges announced on Friday are part of the Department’s commitment to address historical failures in the administration of the Federal student loan program in which qualifying payments made under IDR plans that should have moved borrowers closer to forgiveness were not accurately accounted for. Borrowers are eligible for forgiveness if they have accumulated the equivalent of either 20 or 25 years of qualifying months depending on their loan type and IDR plan. Friday’s action is a result of the Biden-Harris Administration’s implementation of the payment count adjustment announced in April 2022. The state-by-state breakdown of relief and eligible borrowers can be found below: Borrowers Approved for IDR Discharge under the Account Adjustment by Location State Borrower Count Debt Eligible for Discharge (in millions) Alabama 12,720 $553.90 Alaska 970 $51.40 Arizona 20,530 $1,030.40 Arkansas 6,940 $342.60 California 61,890 $2,958.80 Colorado 15,010 $805.40 Connecticut 7,230 $309.90 Delaware 2,430 $113.10 District of Columbia 2,230 $130.20 Florida 56,930 $3,036.80 Georgia 38,590 $2,130.40 Hawaii 1,690 $90.20 Idaho 5,720 $252.90 Illinois 28,450 $1,316.00 Indiana 19,470 $932.80 Iowa 10,730 $465.10 Kansas 8,410 $424.50 Kentucky 11,180 $447.70 Louisiana 15,190 $824.70 Maine 4,790 $212.50 Maryland 16,750 $918.30 Massachusetts 12,530 $592.00 Michigan 26,980 $1,267.30 Minnesota 13,610 $645.20 Mississippi 9,480 $450.90 Missouri 18,800 $956.80 Montana 3,700 $185.20 Nebraska 5,700 $268.90 Nevada 6,820 $330.00 New Hampshire 3,090 $143.80 New Jersey 17,290 $788.00 New Mexico 5,410 $260.30 New York 42,070 $1,924.10 North Carolina 24,870 $1,135.10 North Dakota 2,110 $100.60 Ohio 37,070 $1,736.90 Oklahoma 11,530 $548.40 Oregon 11,780 $572.80 Pennsylvania 29,840 $1,343.50 Rhode Island 2,580 $109.70 South Carolina 16,330 $855.20 South Dakota 3,030 $147.40 Tennessee 16,970 $867.90 Texas 63,730 $3,091.80 Utah 3,940 $212.00 Vermont 1,930 $95.80 Virginia 21,560 $1,042.50 Washington 16,310 $777.10 West Virginia 4,950 $196.20 Wisconsin 12,220 $576.10 Wyoming 1,230 $61.50 All Other Locations 8,710 $350.30 TOTAL 803,990 $38,980.90 On Friday, President Biden released the following statement on his Administration’s action to deliver $39 billion in relief to more than 800,000 borrowers: “I have long said that college should be a ticket to the middle class - not a burden that weighs down on families for decades. “My Administration is delivering on that commitment. Starting today, over 800,000 student loan borrowers who have been repaying their loans for 20 years or more will see $39 billion of their loans discharged because of steps my Administration took to fix failures of the past. These borrowers will join the millions of people that my Administration has provided relief to over the past two years – resulting in over $116 billion in loan relief to over 3 million borrowers under my Administration. “But we’re not stopping there. My Administration has worked hard to secure the largest increases to Pell Grants in a decade, fixed broken loan programs such as Public Service Loan Forgiveness, and created a new income-driven repayment plan that will cut undergraduate loan payments in half and bring monthly payments to zero for low-income borrowers. And, when the Supreme Court made the wrong decision, I immediately announced a new plan to open an alternative path to relief for as many borrowers as possible, as soon as possible. “Republican lawmakers – who had no problem with the government forgiving millions of dollars of their own business loans – have tried everything they can to stop me from providing relief to hardworking Americans. Some are even objecting to the actions we announced today, which follows through on relief borrowers were promised, but never given, even when they had been making payments for decades. The hypocrisy is stunning, and the disregard for working and middle-class families is outrageous. “As long as I’m in office, I will continue to work to bring the promise of college to every American.” Vice President Harris also issued a statement, available here . Eligible borrowers were notified by the Department starting last Friday that they qualify for forgiveness without further action on their part. Discharges will begin 30 days after those emails were sent. Borrowers who wish to opt out of the discharge for any reason should contact their loan servicer during this period. Borrowers will be notified by their servicer after their debt is discharged. Those receiving forgiveness will have repayment on those loans paused until their discharge is processed, while those who opt out of the discharge will return to repayment once payments resume. “For far too long, borrowers fell through the cracks of a broken system that failed to keep accurate track of their progress towards forgiveness,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona on Friday. “Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is taking another historic step to right these wrongs and announcing $39 billion in debt relief for another 804,000 borrowers. By fixing past administrative failures, we are ensuring everyone gets the forgiveness they deserve, just as we have done for public servants, students who were cheated by their colleges, and borrowers with permanent disabilities, including veterans. This Administration will not stop fighting to level the playing field in higher education.” The Department will continue to identify and notify borrowers who reach the applicable forgiveness thresholds (240 or 300 qualifying monthly payments, depending on their repayment plan and type of loan) every two months until next year when all borrowers who are not yet eligible for forgiveness will have their payment counts updated. Any month counted for this purpose can also be counted toward PSLF if the borrower documents qualifying employment for that same period. The data released today builds on the Biden-Harris Administration’s unparalleled record of student debt relief to date, including: $45 billion for 653,800 public servants through improvements to PSLF; $10.5 billion for 491,000 borrowers who have a total and permanent disability; and $22 billion for nearly 1.3 million borrowers who were cheated by their schools, saw their schools precipitously close, or are covered by related court settlements. President Biden and the Department have also taken steps to help borrowers access affordable payments going forward. The Department recently issued final regulations creating the most affordable payment plan ever—the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan. The SAVE plan will cut payments on undergraduate loans in half compared to other IDR plans, ensure that borrowers never see their balance grow as long as they keep up with their required payments, and protect more of a borrower’s income for basic needs. A single borrower who makes less than $15 an hour will not have to make any payments. Borrowers earning above that amount will save more than $1,000 a year on their payments compared to other IDR plans. Benefits from the SAVE plan will start becoming available this summer."

In total, the Biden-Harris Administration has approved more than $116.6 billion in student loan forgiveness for more than 3.4 million borrowers. The forthcoming discharges are a result of fixes implemented by the Biden-Harris Administration to ensure all borrowers have an accurate count of the number of monthly payments that qualify toward forgiveness under income-driven repayment (IDR) plans. These fixes are part of the Department’s commitment to address historical failures in the administration of the Federal student loan program in which qualifying payments made under IDR plans that should have moved borrowers closer to forgiveness were not accounted for. Borrowers are eligible for forgiveness if they have accumulated the equivalent of either 20 or 25 years of qualifying months. “For far too long, borrowers fell through the cracks of a broken system that failed to keep accurate track of their progress towards forgiveness,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is taking another historic step to right these wrongs and announcing $39 billion in debt relief for another 804,000 borrowers.

This Administration will not stop fighting to level the playing field in higher education.” Today’s action is part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s implementation of the payment count adjustment announced in April 2022. That action addressed historical inaccuracies in the count of payments that qualify toward forgiveness under IDR plans. Under the Higher Education Act and the Department’s regulations, a borrower is eligible for forgiveness after making 240 or 300 monthly payments—the equivalent of 20 or 25 years on an IDR plan or the standard repayment plan, with the number of required payments varying based upon when a borrower first took out the loans, the type of loans they borrowed, and the IDR payment plan in which the borrower is enrolled. Inaccurate payment counts have resulted in borrowers losing hard-earned progress toward loan forgiveness. This action also addresses concerns about practices by loan servicers that put borrowers into forbearance in violation of Department rules. The Department previously began discharging loans for borrowers who reached forgiveness for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) through these changes. “At the start of this Administration, millions of borrowers had earned loan forgiveness but never received it. That’s unacceptable,” said Under Secretary James Kvaal. ""Today we are holding up the bargain we offered borrowers who have completed decades of repayment.” Borrowers receiving notifications in the coming days include those with Direct Loans or Federal Family Education Loans held by the Department (including Parent PLUS loans of either type) who have reached the necessary forgiveness threshold as a result of receiving credit toward IDR forgiveness for any of the following periods: Any month in which a borrower was in a repayment status, regardless of whether payments were partial or late, the type of loan, or the repayment plan; Any period in which a borrower spent 12 or more consecutive months in forbearance; Any month in forbearance for borrowers who spent 36 or more cumulative months in forbearance; Any month spent in deferment (except for in-school deferment) prior to 2013; and Any month spent in economic hardship or military deferments on or after January 1, 2013. In addition, months described above that occurred prior to a loan consolidation will also be counted toward forgiveness. The Department will continue to identify and notify borrowers who reach the applicable forgiveness thresholds (240 or 300 qualifying monthly payments, depending on their repayment plan and type of loan) every two months until next year when all borrowers who are not yet eligible for forgiveness will have their payment counts updated. Any month counted for this purpose can also be counted toward PSLF if the borrower documents qualifying employment for that same period. Eligible borrowers will be informed by the Department starting today that they qualify for forgiveness without further action on their part. Discharges will begin 30 days after emails are sent. Borrowers who wish to opt out of the discharge for any reason should contact their loan servicer during this period. Borrowers will be notified by their servicer after their debt is discharged. Those receiving forgiveness will have repayment on their loans paused until their discharge is processed, while those who opt out of the discharge will return to repayment once payments resume. Today’s action builds on the Biden-Harris Administration’s unparalleled record of student debt relief to date, including: $45 billion for 653,800 public servants through improvements to PSLF; $10.5 billion for 491,000 borrowers who have a total and permanent disability; and $22 billion for nearly 1.3 million borrowers who were cheated by their schools, saw their schools precipitously close, or are covered by related court settlements. President Biden and the Department have also taken steps to help borrowers access affordable payments going forward. The Department recently issued final regulations creating the most affordable payment plan ever—the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan. The SAVE plan will cut payments on undergraduate loans in half compared to other IDR plans, ensure that borrowers never see their balance grow as long as they keep up with their required payments, and protect more of a borrower’s income for basic needs. A single borrower who makes less than $15 an hour will not have to make any payments. Borrowers earning above that amount will save more than $1,000 a year on their payments compared to other IDR plans. Benefits from the SAVE plan will start becoming available this summer."

OCR’s investigation reflects that during the 2021-22 school year, a nonbinary student and their parent reported to the district that students repeatedly mocked and targeted the student during multiple classes, while multiple teachers repeatedly used incorrect pronouns for the student and one teacher removed the student from class on the ground that the teacher could not protect the student from harassment by the other students. In addition, OCR reviewed evidence that students bumped the harassed student in the hallways and called the student a derogatory slur for LGBTQI+ people. Ultimately, the district responded to these allegations of harassment by changing the student’s schedule to attend school in-person for only three classes and to take additional classes through self-directed study. Based on the evidence in the investigation to date, OCR is concerned that the district response to the persistent harassment limited the student’s participation in school activities. Additionally, the information produced in the investigation does not reflect the district taking steps to ensure the student’s equal access to education with their peers. OCR is also concerned that the district records miscoded sex-based harassment, including the use of a slur for LGBTQI+ people, as “peer mistreatment”; did not document the multiple complaints of sex-based harassment brought by the student and their parent; and did not adequately document the district’s responses. Moreover, the district Title IX coordinator reported that she was unaware of reports of sex-based harassment of the student until after the complainant filed with OCR and therefore had not coordinated a response consistent with Title IX. “Congress promises every student a right to fully participate in educational programs without harassment based on sex. Rhinelander School District has now committed to take steps to ensure that promise of equal access to education for all its students,” said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon. The district’s commitments in the voluntary resolution agreement include: Evaluating whether compensatory services or other services are necessary for the harassed student due to the instructional time the student missed when attending in-person classes on an only part-time basis. Providing training to all district administrators and staff regarding the district’s obligation, in compliance with Title IX, to respond to complaints of sex-based harassment. Providing age-appropriate information programs for students to address sex-based harassment, including what students should do if they believe they or other students have experienced such harassment. And, Conducting a climate survey to assess the prevalence of sex-based harassment and obtain suggestions for effective ways to address harassment.

30-Jun-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-new-actions-provide-debt-relief-and-support-student-loan-borrowers,FACT SHEET: President Biden Announces New Actions to Provide Debt Relief and Support for Student Loan Borrowers,"No President has fought harder for student debt relief than President Biden, and he's not done yet. President Biden will not let Republican elected officials succeed in denying hardworking Americans the relief they need. In light of the Supreme Court's ruling this morning, President Biden and his Administration have already taken two steps this afternoon aimed at providing debt relief for as many borrowers as possible, as fast as possible, and supporting student loan borrowers: The Secretary of Education initiated a rulemaking process aimed at opening an alternative path to debt relief for as many working and middle-class borrowers as possible, using the Secretary's authority under the Higher Education Act. The Department of Education (Department) finalized the most affordable repayment plan ever created, ensuring that borrowers will be able to take advantage of this plan this summer—before loan payments are due. This plan helps the typical borrower save more than $1,000 a year. In addition, to protect the most vulnerable borrowers from the worst consequences of missed payments following the payment restart, the Department is instituting a 12-month ""on-ramp"" to repayment, running from October 1, 2023 to September 30, 2024, so that financially vulnerable borrowers who miss monthly payments during this period are not considered delinquent, reported to credit bureaus, placed in default, or referred to debt collection agencies. These actions reflect the President's belief that an education beyond high school should be a ticket to the middle class. It also builds on the unprecedented steps President Biden and his Administration have taken to make college more affordable for working and middle-class families and make federal student loans more manageable. The Biden-Harris Administration has: Secured the largest increases to Pell Grants in a decade. Fixed broken student loan programs such as Public Service Loan Forgiveness, so borrowers actually get the relief they deserve. Approved more than $66 billion in loan cancellation for 2.2 million borrowers across the country, including public service workers and those who have been defrauded by their colleges. Debt Relief for As Many Borrowers as Possible, as Fast as Possible The President remains committed to providing relief to low- and middle-income borrowers. For too many Americans, a ticket to the middle-class remains out of reach because of unmanageable student loan debt. COVID-19 exacerbated that challenge – risking tens of millions of borrowers' financial security and futures because of the economic harms brought on by a once-in-a-century pandemic. Today, the Department initiated rulemaking aimed at opening an alternative path to debt relief for as many borrowers as possible, using the Secretary of Education's authority under the Higher Education Act. The Department issued a notice, which is the first step in the process of issuing new regulations under this so-called ""negotiated rulemaking"" process. The notice announces a virtual public hearing on July 18th and solicits written comments from stakeholders on topics to consider. Following the public hearing, the Department will finalize the issues to be addressed through rulemaking and begin the negotiated rulemaking sessions this fall. The Department will complete this rulemaking as quickly as possible. Lowering Monthly Payments The Biden-Harris Administration today also finalized the most affordable repayment plan ever created, called the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan. This income-driven repayment plan will cut borrowers' monthly payments in half, help the typical borrower save more than $1,000 per year on payments, allow many borrowers to make $0 monthly payments, and ensure borrowers don't see their balances grow from unpaid interest. Specifically, the plan will: For undergraduate loans, cut in half the amount that borrowers have to pay each month from 10% to 5% of discretionary income. Raise the amount of income that is considered non-discretionary income and therefore is protected from repayment, guaranteeing that no borrower earning under 225% of the federal poverty level—about the annual equivalent of a $15 minimum wage for a single borrower—will have to make a monthly payment under this plan. Forgive loan balances after 10 years of payments, instead of 20 years, for borrowers with original loan balances of $12,000 or less. The Department estimates that this reform will allow nearly all community college borrowers to be debt-free within 10 years. Not charge borrowers with unpaid monthly interest, so that unlike other existing income-driven repayment plans, no borrower's loan balance will grow as long as they make their monthly payments—even when that monthly payment is $0 because their income is low. All student borrowers in repayment will be eligible to enroll in the SAVE plan. They will be able to enroll later this summer, before any monthly payments are due. Borrowers who sign up or are already signed up for the current Revised Pay as You Earn (REPAYE) plan will be automatically enrolled in SAVE once the new plan is implemented. To learn more about the new SAVE plan, visit the Department of Education's website . Ensuring Support for Borrowers Most at Risk To protect the most vulnerable borrowers, the Department is creating a temporary ""on-ramp"" to protect borrowers from the harshest consequences of late, missed, or partial payments for up to 12 months. While payments will be due and interest will accrue during this period, interest will not capitalize at the end of the on-ramp period. Additionally, borrowers will not be reported to credit bureaus, be considered in default, or referred to collection agencies for late, missed, or partial payments during the on-ramp period. Future monthly bills for borrowers not enrolled in an income-driven repayment plan will be automatically adjusted to reflect the accrued interest during those months. Borrowers who can pay should do so, but this on-ramp period gives borrowers who cannot make payments right away the necessary time to adjust, enabling them to ultimately make their monthly payments and meet their financial obligations on their loans. Borrowers do not need to take any action to qualify for this on-ramp."
30-Jun-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/secretary-cardona-statement-supreme-court-ruling-biden-administrations-one-time-student-debt-relief-plan,Secretary Cardona Statement on Supreme Court Ruling on Biden Administration's One Time Student Debt Relief Plan,"Today, U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona issued the following statement on the Supreme Court's ruling on the Biden Administration's one-time student debt relief plan: ""Today, the Supreme Court ruled against students and families across the country. It's an outrage that lawsuits brought on by Republican elected officials have blocked critical student debt relief that would have been a lifeline for more than 40 million Americans—nearly 90 percent of whom make less than $75,000 a year. ""President Biden, Vice President Harris, and I will never stop fighting for borrowers, which is why we are using every tool available to provide them with needed relief. Earlier today, the Department of Education initiated a regulatory process to provide debt relief, so we can help the working- and middle-class borrowers who need it most. ""Additionally, today the Department finalized our new income driven repayment plan, Saving on A Valuable Education (SAVE), which will be the most affordable repayment plan in history. It will cut monthly payments to zero dollars for millions of low-income borrowers, save all other borrowers at least $1,000 per year, and stop runaway interest that leaves borrowers owing more than their initial loan. ""Finally, the Department is providing a 12-month on-ramp transition period that will help ensure borrowers smoothly and successfully return to repayment without falling into delinquency or default. Borrowers who can make payments should do so as payments will resume and interest will accrue, but the on-ramp to repayment will help borrowers avoid the harshest consequences of missed, partial, or late payments like negative credit reports and having loans referred to collection agencies. ""In addition to today's actions, our Administration will continue the critical work we have pursued under President Biden's leadership to make college more affordable to more Americans and make long-overdue improvements to the student loan system. President Biden, Vice President Harris, and I remain fully committed to ensuring students can earn a postsecondary education, and build fulfilling careers without the burden of student loan debt blocking them from opportunity.""

30-Jun-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-launch-application-process-expand-federal-pell-grant-access-individuals-who-are-confined-or-incarcerated,U.S. Department of Education to Launch Application Process to Expand Federal Pell Grant Access for Individuals Who Are Confined or Incarcerated,"The U.S. Department of Education (Department) tomorrow will launch a new process through which institutions of higher education can apply to offer postsecondary programs to confined or incarcerated individuals. For the first time in nearly 30 years, as a result of statutory changes enacted through the FAFSA Simplification Act, individuals enrolled in approved prison education programs (PEPs) will be eligible for Federal Pell Grants outside a limited pilot program known as the Second Chance Pell Experiment. The Department will begin accepting applications on July 3, 2023, and will approve applications on a rolling basis. While the Second Chance Pell Experiment was a limited program, it has expanded opportunity for incarcerated individuals. According to the Vera Institute , more than 40,000 students received Pell Grants under the experiment through the 2021-22 award year. Based on current participation rates in Second Chance Pell Experiment, the Department estimates that full reinstatement of Pell could allow an estimated 760,000 additional individuals to become eligible for a Pell Grant through prison education programs once institutions have fully developed their prison programs. “I call on colleges and postsecondary programs across our country to meet this moment and step up to serve people who’ve been impacted by the criminal justice system, who for the first time in three decades will be eligible for Pell Grants to help pay for education,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “Prison education programs reduce recidivism rates and create meaningful opportunities for redemption and rehabilitation that improve lives, strengthen communities, and reflect America’s ideal as a nation of second chances and limitless possibilities. This historic moment marks the start of a nationwide effort that could help over 760,000 individuals who are currently incarcerated pursue degrees, credentials, and skills that set them up for success and lead to brighter futures.” Improvements to Prison Education Programs Last fall, the Department finalized regulatory requirements for PEPs that build on the efforts of institutions and correctional facilities that have been working together to increase the number of individuals who are confined or incarcerated with access to a quality postsecondary education. Starting July 1, 2023, eligible institutions (i.e., public and private non-profit institutions) must adhere to the standards for implementing effective PEPs established under the Department’s final regulations, which: Establish the definition of a PEP as defined in the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA), Outline application requirements for approval of PEPs, and Clarify the requirements and obligations of institutions, accrediting agencies, and oversight entities. Prison Education Program Application Process Starting July 3, 2023, institutions can apply to offer a PEP through the Federal Student Aid E-App. To be considered, institutions must include their completed PEP Application Form in the E-App submission. Instructions and other information—including specific certifications and signatures that institutions provide for the Department to evaluate a PEP—are posted in an Electronic Announcement on the Federal Student Aid Partner Connect Portal. Institutions can access the PEP Application Form on the Prison Education Program topics page on the Knowledge Center. Nearly 200 postsecondary institutions currently participate in the Second Chance Pell Experiment. Under this experiment, institutions provide Federal Pell Grant funding to thousands of students who are confined or incarcerated and previously could not access Federal need-based financial aid so that they can access, afford, and engage in higher education. Earlier this month, the Department approved more than 160 of those institutions to transition into a revised version of the experiment that allows institutions to continue serving their students who are confined or incarcerated after July 1, 2023. Institutions in the revised experiment will have up to three years to seek Department approval of the PEPs they wish to offer under the Department’s new regulations. Benefits of PEPs The changes announced today are part of the Department’s ongoing efforts to champion access to Federal student aid and higher education for underserved populations. Prison education programs transform the culture, climate, and safety of correctional facilities, and can provide purpose and dignity for people with long-term and life sentences, who then are the culture-bearers for those with shorter sentences. Data shows that postsecondary programs offered in correctional facilities have also positively impacted students' skills, future employment outcomes, and recidivism rates. For example, research on prison education programs conducted by the RAND Corporation and funded by the Department of Justice showed that prison education program participants were 43 percent less likely to recidivate and had employment rates 13 percent higher than those who do not participate, supporting their successful reentry and strengthening public safety. High-quality prison education programs are also good for correctional facilities and their employees as jails and prisons with college programs have fewer violent incidents, creating a safer living and work environment. Prison education programs also benefit taxpayers. The RAND Corporation also found that every dollar invested in prison education programs saves taxpayers up to five dollars. Additionally, prison education programs have a powerful inter-generational effect that can transform outcomes for both learners who are incarcerated and their children and other relatives. In today’s global economy, employment depends on 21st century skills and credentials for everyone in our workforce. Equipping learners who are confined or incarcerated with foundational skills and technical competencies will help them to earn postsecondary credentials, help them succeed and thrive during reentry, reduce incarceration costs, and maximize public safety in our communities."
29-Jun-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-actions-promote-educational-opportunity-and-diversity-colleges-and-universities,FACT SHEET: President Biden Announces Actions to Promote Educational Opportunity and Diversity in Colleges and Universities,"Today, the Supreme Court upended decades of precedent that enabled America’s colleges and universities to build vibrant diverse environments where students are prepared to lead and learn from one another. Although the Court’s decision threatens to move the country backwards, the Biden-Harris Administration will fight to preserve the hard-earned progress we have made to advance racial equity and civil rights and expand educational opportunity for all Americans. As our nation’s colleges and universities consider their admissions processes in the wake of the Court’s decision, President Biden is calling on them to seize the opportunity to expand access to educational opportunity for all. Our nation is stronger when our colleges and universities reflect the vast and rich diversity of our people. But while talent, creativity, and hard work are everywhere across this country, equal opportunity is not. Specifically, the President is calling on colleges and universities, when selecting among qualified applicants, to give serious consideration to the adversities students have overcome, including: the financial means of a student or their family; where a student grew up and went to high school; and personal experiences of hardship or discrimination, including racial discrimination, that a student may have faced. In doing so, colleges and universities can fully value aspiring students who demonstrate resilience and determination in the face of deep challenges. The Biden-Harris Administration is taking swift action to support our Nation’s colleges and universities so they can continue building pathways to upward mobility and success for all students to thrive in the American workforce and our Nation’s military. Specifically, the Biden-Harris Administration is: Providing colleges and universities with clarity on what admissions practices and additional programs to support students remain lawful. The Department of Education and Department of Justice will provide resources to colleges and universities addressing lawful admissions practices within the next 45 days, as colleges prepare for the next application cycle. The Department of Education will also provide assistance to colleges and universities in administering programs to support students from underserved communities. Convening a National Summit on Educational Opportunity . The Department of Education will host a national summit on equal opportunity in postsecondary education next month with advocates, student leaders, college and university administrators, researchers, and state, local, and Tribal leaders to share lessons learned, innovative strategies, and develop additional resources for colleges and students to expand access to educational opportunity. Releasing a report on strategies for increasing diversity and educational opportunity, including meaningful consideration of adversity. Following the Summit, the Department of Education will produce a report by this September, elevating promising admissions practices to build inclusive, diverse student bodies, including by using measures of adversity. The report will address topics including the impact of current admissions practices that may negatively affect the admissions chances of students from underserved communities; strategies to integrate measures of adversity in admissions; outreach and recruitment programs to create diverse applicant pools; strategies for retention and degree completion; and financial and other support programs to make college attainable. Increasing transparency in college admissions and enrollment practices. The Administration is committed to providing transparent data with respect to admissions and enrollment. The Department of Education’s National Center for Educational Statistics will consider ways to collect and publish more information related to college application and enrollment trends. This includes ways that information might be validly disaggregated by race and ethnicity, first-generation status, legacy status, and other measures. Information in these areas could help higher education leaders, academics and the general public address potential barriers to college recruitment, admissions, and enrollment. Supporting states in analyzing data to increase access to educational opportunity for underserved communities. The Department of Education will assist states and Tribal nations in marshaling their data to improve college recruitment, admissions, and financial aid practices to devise strategies for increasing access to educational opportunity, such as partnerships to appropriately share and use education data, and direct admissions programs that proactively admit students based on factors such as academic performance and students’ geographic location – without requiring them to apply or pay an application fee. This work builds upon the Biden-Harris Administration’s historic efforts to ensure all students have the opportunity to access higher education by: Securing a historic increase in the Pell Grants: The President championed the largest increase to Pell Grants in the last decade – a combined increase of $900 to the maximum award over the past two years to benefit low – and middle-income students. Prioritizing college completion: The Biden-Harris Administration has championed efforts to improve postsecondary outcomes, particularly for students who face the greatest barriers to accessing and completing college. In response to the President Biden’s budget, Congress established a new Postsecondary Student Success Grant program to provide direct support to institutions to engage in evidence-based activities that support college re-enrollment, retention, and completion among individuals who are close to graduation. Supporting America’s Minority-Serving Institutions: President Biden has secured historic investments in institutions that enroll and graduate disproportionate shares of low-income students and students of color, including tens of billions of dollars in funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal Colleges and Universities, and Minority Serving Institutions, including Hispanic Serving Institutions through the Department of Education. Fixing the broken student loan system: The Biden-Harris Administration has taken action to make the student loan system more manageable for current and future borrowers and reduce the burden of student debt, including by: Cutting monthly payments in half for undergraduate loans. The Department of Education is proposing an income-driven repayment plan that protects more low-income borrowers from making any payments and caps monthly payments for undergraduate loans at 5% of a borrower’s discretionary income – half of the rate that borrowers must pay now under existing plans. The average annual student loan payment will be lowered by more than $1,000 for both current and future student borrowers who owe payments. Fixing the broken Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program by ensuring that borrowers who have worked at a qualifying nonprofit organization, in the military, or in federal, state, Tribal, or local government, receive appropriate credit towards loan forgiveness. These regulatory changes build on temporary changes the Department of Education made to PSLF, under which roughly 616,000 public servants received more than $42 billion in loan forgiveness. Ensuring targeted student loan forgiveness programs work. Including its reforms to PSLF, the Department of Education has approved a total of more than $66 billion in relief to over 2.2 million student loan borrowers, including many who were defrauded by their college, enrolled in a college that abruptly closed, or are permanently disabled and unable to work."
29-Jun-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/secretary-cardona-statement-supreme-court-ruling-college-affirmative-action-programs,Secretary Cardona Statement on Supreme Court Ruling on College Affirmative Action Programs,"“Today’s Supreme Court decision takes our country decades backward, sharply limiting a vital tool that colleges have used to create vibrant, diverse campus communities. Students of color have long faced inequities in education and college access, and today’s ruling is yet another blow to the fight for equal opportunity. As we consider today’s decision, our commitment to educational opportunity for all Americans is unshaken, and our efforts to promote diversity in higher education are undeterred. The Department of Education is a civil rights agency, committed to equal access and educational opportunity for all students.” “I want to send a message to all aspiring students, especially Black, Latino, Asian American, Native American, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, and other students from underserved communities: we see you and we need you. Do not let this ruling deter you from pursuing your educational potential. Our colleges and our country itself cannot thrive and compete in the 21st century without your talent, ingenuity, perseverance, and ambition. “To our higher education leaders reviewing the decision: now is not the time to lessen your commitment to campus communities that reflect the rich diversity of this nation, which enhance the college experience in myriad ways and prepare students from all walks of life to live, work, and lead our democracy together. Your leadership and commitment to ensuring our educational institutions reflect the vast and rich diversity of our people are needed now more than ever. The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to supporting you in pursuing all lawful practices that meet that goal. We will continue working with you to raise the bar for inclusivity and work intentionally to better support students of color, because the inequities that exist in higher education access and outcomes remain unacceptable.”"
28-Jun-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/civil-rights-reaches-agreement-resolve-sexual-harassment-investigation-montgomery-college-maryland,Office for Civil Rights Reaches Agreement to Resolve Sexual Harassment Investigation of Montgomery College in Maryland,"Today, the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) resolved a sexual harassment investigation of the Takoma/Silver Spring Campus of Montgomery College in Maryland. OCR determined that the college complied with the applicable requirements of Title IX by conducting a prompt and equitable investigation of harassment allegations against a professor. However, OCR’s investigation identified a Title IX compliance concern based on the college not having provided all affected students with notification that the college had completed the investigation, that the college’s investigation confirmed the existence of a hostile environment based on sex, and that the college had taken steps designed to end that hostile environment for students impacted by the professor’s harassing conduct. OCR’s investigation established that a college professor engaged in sexual harassment of female students during a class he taught by requiring the students to remove their shirts and wear only their bras – and then commenting on their bodies – ostensibly to demonstrate a medical assessment, despite the fact that the assessment did not require the clothing removal, or the bodily commentary. In response to student reports of the harassment they experienced, including targeted harassment after class from the professor, the college immediately placed the professor on paid administrative leave and notified him of the allegations. Consistent with Title IX obligations, the college’s Title IX Coordinator emailed all students in the professor’s class to advise them that the college would be conducting a formal investigation, and that he was available to assist any student in reporting the incident to the police. He also offered to interview all students in the class, or, alternatively, to accept written statements. In addition, he provided all students in the class with a copy of the college’s Title IX Policy and information about available college and community resources, services and interim remedies. The college interviewed students from the professor’s class, students from another section of the class taught by the professor, the department chair, and other student witnesses. Within approximately three months of the initial report of the professor’s harassment, the college’s investigation confirmed that the professor’s conduct created a hostile environment on the basis of sex. The college terminated the professor’s employment and the college provided written notice of the outcome of its investigation to the student in the class who initially reported experiencing sexual harassment. The college also offered supportive services to affected students and coordinated counseling within days of the incident for at least one student in the class and provided academic assistance and tuition reimbursement for several other students in the class. Despite these effective Title IX steps, the college did not notify all affected students regarding the conclusion of its investigation. This lack of notification raises a concern that the college may not have taken necessary steps to ensure that a hostile environment did not persist for affected students. The resolution agreement requires the college to notify in writing all students in the professor’s class that the college completed its investigation of the sexual harassment complaint against the professor. The agreement also requires the college to provide OCR with the results of its 2022 Title IX climate survey and provide for OCR’s review a narrative summary of the steps it has taken in response to any concerns raised by that survey in order for OCR to determine whether the college needs to take any additional steps to ensure college students are able to access their education free from discrimination. “The shameful underlying facts in this investigation – of a college professor subjecting his entire class to sexual harassment as a condition of instruction – are galling and categorically unacceptable under Title IX,” said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon. “I am deeply grateful to Montgomery College for swiftly responding with a thorough investigation and action to address the effects of the hostile environment created by the professor on the students in his class, and I appreciate the additional commitment Montgomery College made to fulfill its remaining obligation under Title IX to ensure that the discriminatory effects end for all its students.” The letter to Montgomery College is available here and the resolution agreement is available here ."

Schools have committed nearly 60 percent of their American Rescue Plan funds to address lost learning time and accelerate academic recovery by hiring more teachers, counselors, and support staff, providing more tutoring and one-on-one support to students, and extending learning time through high quality afterschool and summer learning programs. “While this latest data reminds us how far we still need to go, I’m encouraged that the historic investments and resources provided by the American Rescue Plan and the Department of Education are beginning to show positive results, with several states returning to pre-pandemic levels of achievement on their state math and literacy assessments, as well as promising results for the U.S. on a recent international reading assessment. “At the Department of Education, we continue to offer technical assistance, issue guidance, and hold convenings focused on the specific strategies included in our Raise the Bar: Lead the World Plan for improving academic performance and tackling disparities in educational opportunities and outcomes. More action is needed at every level to reverse decades of educational neglect and to Raise the Bar for all students.”"

BSCA set forth crucial mental health investments and actions to prevent and respond to gun violence in communities, ensure that those experiencing grief and trauma resulting from gun violence have access to high-quality mental health services, and supports to make our schools safer and expand community violence interventions. ""It's no secret that we are facing a mental health crisis in this country, and our children are hurting,"" said U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra. ""That is why this Administration is committed to addressing this crisis through continued efforts, investments, and more. The actions being announced today will make it easier for schools to receive payment for the mental health services they deliver to students impacted by gun violence. At HHS, we will continue working to ensure young people have more places to turn to for help."" “Too many students have experienced gun violence in their schools and communities. The grief and trauma caused by gun violence undermines their ability to learn and thrive and has only heightened the national youth mental health crisis,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “The Department of Education is using every available resource to maximize the investments made through the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act to help schools build an infrastructure of care and support for students. The Biden-Harris administration will continue working to break down silos between education and health care, raise the bar for our support of students’ mental health and wellbeing, and ensure our schools are safe havens for teaching and learning.” To advance the mission of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, Secretaries Becerra and Cardona sent a joint letter to governors highlighting resources to help states, communities, and schools support students’ mental health and well-being, particularly students impacted by gun violence. The letter highlights ED’s investments and capacity-building efforts that will expand and improve school-based mental health services, address community violence, provide wraparound supports, and promote a safe and supportive school climate. The letter also outlines HHS’s efforts to support the development of school-based mental health supports; prepare and train school personnel, emergency first responders, law enforcement and others to recognize the signs and symptoms of mental health impacts from gun violence; and increase treatment and support services for individuals and communities affected by trauma, including trauma caused by gun violence. ED and HHS are working together on BSCA implementation because today’s young people are facing unprecedented challenges and disruptions in their school lives and communities, including increased disconnection and social isolation as well as increased gun violence. These challenges have had devastating effects on students’ mental health and well-being, which in turn have profound implications for their academic success and their overall life outcomes. These new actions help extend the impact of BSCA in keeping our communities safe, bringing new resources and protections to bear both in addressing the mental health challenges that young people face so that all students can learn freely and safely every day and curbing gun violence in our communities. The Biden Administration has taken a multifaceted approach to BSCA implementation to deliver on crucial protections and resources to help prevent gun violence in schools and support the development of high-quality school-based mental health services. At ED, this includes awarding $286 million to date across 264 grantees in 48 states and territories to boost the training, hiring, and diversification of mental health professionals in schools through its School-Based Mental Health and Mental Health Service Professional Demonstration grant programs (which will result in an estimated 14,000 additional mental health professionals in schools); distributing $1 billion in the Stronger Connections Grant program to help schools in high-need districts provide students with safe, welcoming, and supportive learning opportunities and environments that are critical for their success; and providing an additional $50 million to supplement before- and after-school programming for young people through the Nita M. Lowey 21st Century Community Learning Centers, through evidence-based practices that increase attendance and engagement among middle- and high-school aged youth. At HHS, nearly $245 million in funding has been awarded to support youth mental health, help the health care workforce address mental health needs, and fund other critical mental health supports; $70 million to help develop and support school-based mental health programs; almost $60 million to prepare and train school personnel, emergency first responders, law enforcement and others to recognize the signs and symptoms of mental health challenges; and almost $55 million to increase treatment and support services for individuals and communities affected by trauma caused by gun violence.. In the coming months, HHS will also provide almost $60 million to states and territories for the second of four increments in supplemental funding for the Community Mental Health Services Block Grant for mental health treatment and recovery services including crisis services and early serious mental illness treatment programs."

Online For All is kicking off today with a Week of Action to drive enrollment in the Affordable Connectivity Program . The Week of Action will bring together the federal government and over 300 organizations to raise awareness about the program and help eligible families sign up. An estimated 28 million households in the U.S. do not have high-speed internet at home, and two-thirds of these households are offline because they need help affording an available internet connection. The Affordable Connectivity Program, created through President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, significantly lowers the cost of internet, and millions more eligible households could still benefit. With a community of supporting organizations and trusted messengers, Online For All will meet people where they are and ensure Americans across the country are connected. Vice President Kamala Harris also released a video encouraging Americans to sign up for the Affordable Connectivity Program at GetInternet.gov . “In our ever-expanding global community, access to the internet can no longer be viewed as a luxury; it is a necessity for every student and family in our country. No student should have to travel to a library, coffeeshop, or parking lot to get connected to the internet to do their homework or complete their college applications, and yet that is still the reality for too many students. It is vital that our students and their families have access to quality, reliable , affordable, high-speed internet to stay connected and engaged with their schools and each other. The ‘Online for All’ campaign will help meet that need for so many. On behalf of Secretary Cardona, we are proud to be a part of this dynamic initiative that will not only raise the bar in education , but change the way we look at access to information for all students, no matter their age, race, economic status, or address,” said U.S. Deputy Secretary of Education Cindy Marten. The U.S. Department of Education will launch the Week of Action by rallying educators and advocates from the National Education Association, National Association of Secondary School Principals, American Federation of Teachers, and more to ensure their schools’ students and families know about the Affordable Connectivity Program and the benefits available to them. The Week of Action features hundreds of additional events, including: U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona will headline a virtual event today with educators alongside the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), the National Association of Education (NEA), and the National Association of Secondary School Principals (NASSP) to provide them with the tools they need to educate families on this opportunity and keep students connected over the summer. The event will begin at 4:00 p.m. ET. Register here. Boston, Massachusetts-based Link Health is leading the Healthcare Day of Action on Friday, June 16, with an event featuring a Veterans Affairs National Social Work Program Special Projects Coordinator at the South End Community Health Center in Boston. The AARP is hosting a tele-town hall on Thursday, June 22 with Senior Advisor to the President and White House Director of Public Engagement Steve Benjamin to educate older Americans all across the country about the opportunity to participate in the Affordable Connectivity Program. The live, audio-only program is available via dial-in at (855) 274-9507 and streaming here. The Department of Education will notify more than 5 million Pell Grant recipients of their eligibility for the program, and that they can enroll without eligibility documentation. Deputy Secretary Cindy Marten will send a message about the Affordable Connectivity Program to 84,000 school principals, vice principals, and tech coordinators across the country. ""Through Online For All, Civic Nation is bringing together more than 300 local and national organizations across the country to ensure the 17 million households that are unconnected, but are eligible for the ACP, have access to high-speed internet — because online is for all of us,"" said Jalakoi Solomon, Executive Vice President of Campaigns and Partnerships at Civic Nation. ""Civic Nation is committed to ensuring everyone can get connected so more young people can access critical learning opportunities; more seniors can access healthcare faster and easier; and more Americans can find higher paying jobs and opportunities to work from home."" Civic Nation also released the Civic Nation Affordable Connectivity Program Pilot Report , which shows the success of community outreach in enrolling eligible households in the program. During the pilot period, grantees educated 39,335 people about the Affordable Connectivity Program; had 2,708 one-on-one conversations with community members; and helped 417 people start their applications and 210 people fully enroll in the Affordable Connectivity Program. Grantees included: South Dakota Voices For Peace in Sioux Falls, who hosted regular office hours at the downtown library, community centers and after-school programs; Somos Tejas in Texas, who brought enrollment to 29 community events; and Vietlead, who served the Vietnamese community in Philadelphia and South Jersey by engaging community members in their native language. With the Federal Communications Commissions' ACP Outreach Grants distributing over $60 million to communities across the country this summer, this report will help prepare grantees and community organizations to create impactful outreach programming. Online For All is supported by companies like Comcast, Verizon, and Dell, as well as national and local community organizations. A full list is here .

12-Jun-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-announces-8-million-promote-native-languages-support-native-teachers-and-tribal-education-agencies,"The Biden-Harris Administration Announces $8 Million to Promote Native Languages, Support Native Teachers and Tribal Education Agencies","The U.S. Department of Education (Department) announced more than $8 million in grant funding across three key initiatives to Raise the Bar for Native students. The funding includes three competitive programs to increase access to Native American languages in America’s schools, support and promote the success of Native American teachers, and ensure Tribal Educational Agencies can coordinate grant resources alongside state and local partners. Native communities are strong, dynamic, and economically diverse. Each of these programs will help meet the urgent need to strengthen the vitality of Native American languages, retain more Native American teachers as leaders, and reinforce collaborative relationships between Tribal and state educational agencies. “Our efforts to Raise the Bar for multilingual learners includes strengthening and revitalizing Native languages and the recruitment, retention, and leadership of Native educators,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “These investments, totaling more than $8 million, reflect our belief at the Department of Education that Tribal Sovereignty starts with Educational Sovereignty, and that all Native students deserve access to an inclusive, culturally affirmative education that’s reflected in the teachers in their schools. The Biden-Harris administration is committed to addressing teacher shortages and growing and retaining a pipeline of educators who can meet the needs of Native students and provide instruction that’s grounded in appreciation for and understanding of their unique Tribal histories, traditions, languages, treaties, and cultures.” Approximately $2.9 million in funding will support a new Native American Language Resource Centers (NALRC) program . The new centers will help preserve and protect Native languages by promoting the use of Native American languages in classrooms across all age levels, academic content areas, and types of schools. The NALRC furthers policies set forth by the Native American Languages Act and ensures the revitalization and reclamation of Native American languages. Eligible entities include institutions of higher education (IHE), an entity within an IHE with dedicated expertise in Native American language and culture education, or a consortium that includes one or more IHEs or one or more entities as described in the Native American Language Resource Center Act . The Department also announced $2.75 million in available funding to support the first-ever (NATRI) competition . NATRI will help address the shortage of Native American educators and promote retention by facilitating opportunities for Native teachers to serve in leadership roles in their schools. This demonstration grant competition will also fund projects that help educators of Native American students better provide culturally appropriate and effective instruction and support for Native American students. These efforts are aimed at ensuring that educators have the necessary knowledge and understanding of Native communities, languages, tribal histories, traditions, and cultures. An applicant could, for example, help educators expand culturally relevant family and community engagement to meet the unique needs of students’ academic and social-emotional learning. Eligible entities include a State educational agency, local educational agency including charter schools that are considered LEAs under State law, an Indian Tribe, an Indian Organization, a federally supported elementary school or secondary school for Indian students, and/or a consortium of eligible applicants. Earlier this month, the Department announced $2.4 million in available funding to support the State Tribal Education Partnership (STEP) program . STEP grants support projects that strengthen Tribal self-determination and promote coordination and collaboration among Tribal, State, and Local educational agencies to meet the unique needs of Native students. The program empowers cross-agency coordination, systemic change, community engagement, and the role of Tribal consultation. Eligible entities include an Indian Tribe or Tribal organization approved by an Indian Tribe, or a Tribal Educational Agency (TEA), including a consortium of TEAs. On June 13, 2023, the Department will host a webinar for interested applicants and existing grantees on the new funding opportunities.

OCR determined that the district discriminated against students based on sex by failing to respond appropriately under Title IX to notice of sexual harassment, including sexual assault, during a two-year period. Specifically, OCR found that the district repeatedly failed to address the effects of sexual harassment on targeted students, did not take sufficient steps to prevent recurrence of harassment, and failed to provide adequate notice of the investigation outcomes to targeted students and their parents. In addition, OCR found a systemic failure, persisting today, by the district to coordinate its response to sexual assault and harassment incidents across schools as required by the Title IX regulations. As a result, the district had no system in place to monitor whether schools’ responses complied with Title IX requirements or to identify emergent patterns or systemic problems by school or districtwide. OCR also determined that the district’s implementation of its current Title IX grievance procedures does not comply fully with the 2020 amended Title IX regulation regarding sexual harassment, that the district’s Title IX grievance procedures in place during the time period reviewed were inequitable because they treated complainants and respondents differently, and the district had not fulfilled its Title IX duty to publish those procedures to communicate to students, parents, and employees how to use them to file Title IX complaints of sexual harassment. OCR also identified concerns with the district’s recordkeeping system to track incidents of sexual harassment across schools. The district agreed to resolve the Title IX violations and concerns OCR identified in a resolution agreement to ensure nondiscrimination on the basis of sex in its schools. “Val Verde Unified School District has agreed to address nearly a decade of Title IX noncompliance regarding sexual harassment, committing now to ensure its students may learn in the safe and nondiscriminatory environment Congress has promised them,” said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon. The resolution terms include: Developing a program to assess the effectiveness of the district’s Title IX anti-discrimination efforts. Revising Title IX policies and procedures to comply with the Title IX regulations. Training staff and students regarding the district’s Title IX procedures, how to identify what constitutes sexual harassment, and how to report such harassment. Maintaining required records regarding reports of sexual harassment. Disseminating a notice of nondiscrimination that complies with Title IX. And, Administering a biannual school climate survey to district employees and students to evaluate the climate at each district school with respect to sexual harassment.

8-Jun-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-announces-grant-opportunities-address-educator-recruitment-retention-and-career-advancement,"U.S. Department of Education Announces Grant Opportunities to Address Educator Recruitment, Retention, and Career Advancement","Today, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) announced the availability of more than $368 million in new grant opportunities through the Education Innovation and Research (EIR) program and the Teacher and School Leader (TSL) Incentive program that advance investments in teacher recruitment and retention. These investments particularly prioritize promoting educator diversity and career advancement and leadership opportunities for effective educators tied to increased compensation. “Teachers shape thriving individuals and communities, as well as the future of our nation. Now more than ever, we need more innovative approaches to supporting the return and retention of outstanding, well-prepared, well-supported educators who meet the needs and reflect the diversity of their students,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education James Lane. “These funds will catalyze more of these approaches in schools across the country.” U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona has announced several actions to Raise the Bar in illustrating the Department’s commitment to transform P-12 education and unite around what is effective—based on decades of experience and research—and advance educational equity and excellence. As part of our Raise the Bar efforts to boldly improve learning conditions, the Department is working to eliminate the educator shortage at every public school and support the educator workforce. The grant opportunities announced today are part of that effort and specifically invest in teacher leadership and career advancement, improved compensation, and teacher diversity—three key strategies the Department is utilizing to eliminate educator shortages. The FY 2023 TSL grant competition is designed to support entities in implementing, improving, or expanding their human capital management, or expanding their performance-based compensation systems. Priorities used in this competition advance the Department’s goal to eliminate educator shortages, including through effective teacher retention efforts such as career advancement opportunities for teachers and improving teacher diversity. The FY 2023 EIR grant competition funds projects that test, replicate, and scale evidence-based practices, and this year’s competition includes priorities for improving educator recruitment and retention. This includes competitive compensation systems; providing more time for planning and collaboration; increasing access to leadership opportunities that can lead to higher pay and improved retention for fully certified, experienced, and effective educators; and expanding the impact of great teachers within and beyond their classrooms. It also supports improving educator diversity. Teacher leadership models provide experienced and effective teachers with leadership opportunities that allow them to have a greater impact on their school communities while remaining in the classroom and being compensated for taking on additional responsibilities. These leadership opportunities support academic success for students while creating career ladders that support teacher retention. Increasing the diversity of the educator workforce so that it reflects the diversity of our students is tied to improved student performance and, by expanding the pool of future teachers, is critical to eliminating shortages. To support applicants in applying for these grant opportunities, the Department offers a series of resources, including pre-applicant webinars to provide technical assistance available online at: https://oese.ed.gov/offices/office-of-discretionary-grants-support-services/ . About EIR The EIR program helps the field design, scale, and validate programs that can help solve education’s most pressing problems. The program is rooted in innovation and is not intended to provide support for practices that are already commonly implemented by educators. Instead, by investing in new and innovative educational programs and practices, EIR grants can help to overcome the persistent and significant challenges to student success. Evaluations under this program are evaluated, and if they can demonstrate sufficient evidence of effectiveness, these innovations can be replicated and tested in new populations and settings. Applicants may propose projects such as: STEM education, including computer science, that expand opportunities for high-need students; high-quality projects that center social and emotional learning; or projects that address improving supports for educators to enhance the ability of schools to recruit and retain staff. Applicants also may propose projects that increase access to leadership opportunities that can lead to increased pay and improved retention for fully certified, experienced, and effective educators, while expanding the impact of great teachers within and beyond their classrooms. Projects may support the recruitment and retention of all school staff or specific staff with acute recruitment and retention challenges. For more information on the FY 2023 EIR competition, visit FY 2023 Competition - Office of Elementary and Secondary Education . About TSL The TSL program supports entities in implementing, improving, or expanding their overall human capital management system, which, by definition, must include a performance-based compensation system. The TSL program primarily serves educators in high-need schools who raise student academic achievement and close the achievement gap between high- and low-performing students, although the program may also fund services for educators serving in high-need subject areas (though not necessarily in high-need schools), as determined by the local educational agency or the state. Applicants also must address how they will support career advancement opportunities for educators.

7-Jun-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/education-department-opens-grant-application-738-million-raise-bar-student-well-being-through-full-service-community-schools,Education Department Opens Grant Application for $73.8 Million to Raise the Bar for Student Well-being through Full-Service Community Schools,"The U.S. Department of Education (Department) today released a Notice Inviting Applications (NIA) for the fiscal year (FY) 2023 Full-Service Community Schools (FSCS) grant program that supports academic acceleration and provides academic and whole child supports to build and strengthen connections between schools, parents, families, and their surrounding communities. This program advances Secretary Cardona’s Raise the Bar call to action around evidence-based strategies that advance educational equity and excellence for all students. Specifically, this program drives community-based resources to support student’s academic advancement and mental health, among other needs. Meeting the needs and building on the assets of the whole child is essential to help America’s students grow academically and improve their well-being. That’s why the Biden-Harris Administration is committed to increasing and supporting the adoption of community school models across the country. Since the President took office, the program has seen a five-fold increase in funding and an expansion of the program’s reach from 170 schools before 2021 to now reaching more than 1,700 schools. Community schools meet the unique needs of the neighborhoods they serve by leveraging local assets, intentionally collaborating with non-profit, private sector, and agency partnerships to bring services into school buildings. The FY 2023 FSCS competition will award $73.8 million to support an estimated 45 grants across the country to coordinate services such as high-quality tutoring, health, mental health and nutrition services, and high-quality out-of-school time and early learning programs, among others, for students and the community. “Full-service community schools embrace the role that schools play as the trusted center of our communities, and build on that role by offering students and families access to wraparound supports and services, from tutoring and mental health counseling to nutrition assistance, violence prevention, and more,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “I’ve visited community schools across the country and seen firsthand how they break down silos among education, health care, nonprofits, and government agencies to meet the needs of the whole child and lift up entire families and neighborhoods. The Biden-Harris team believes in the promise and potential of community schools to transform education and spur the kind of intentional collaboration we need to raise the bar for students’ academic excellence and wellbeing.” Through this commitment, the Department will help spur the planning and capacity-building, development, implementation, operation, and coordination of effective services for students and families, particularly in urban and rural areas with high rates of poverty. The FY 2023 competition will assist in scaling programs, including building their capacity to serve multiple schools, expanding successful models to multiple districts, and implementing evidence-based strategies statewide. Recognizing the impact schools play throughout a student’s development, the Department is also interested in applications that plan to meet students’ social emotional, and academic needs; coordinate across multiple agencies to prevent and address community violence; and focus on supporting the transitions from early learning settings into kindergarten and from kindergarten into the early elementary grades. Deputy Assistant Secretary Bernadine Futrell, PhD, will lift the new grant competition later today during the opening session of the National Community Schools and Family Engagement Conference in Philadelphia. This year’s competition maintains an emphasis on quality implementation through the four pillars of community schools – (1) integrated student supports; (2) expanded and enriched learning time; (3) active family and community engagement; and (4) collaborative leadership and practices – and seeks to expand the evidence base through a national evaluation that will study the implementation of the FY 2023 FSCS grants that are awarded. Additionally, the notice includes an invitational priority to support effective transitions between early childhood education and elementary school settings, uplifting the critical inflection point of the kindergarten year and the developmental needs of every student and support them on a path for early school success. The 2023 competition also builds on several efforts from the administration and Department to support local, district and state efforts to scale community schools. For example, the administration released a Community School Toolkit in January showcasing how federal funding sources may be used to support community schools. The resources from the White House and the Department emphasize the role full-service community schools play in providing academic supports, integrated health and social services, and engagement opportunities to students while also creating stronger connections between families, communities, and their local public schools. These priorities align with the Biden-Harris Administration’s work to scale evidence-based approaches to support students’ academic, social, emotional, and physical well-being.

OCR examined whether the District responded adequately to racial harassment of a Black student at a District school over the course of the 2021-22 school year. The harassment included gratuitous images of the Confederate flag that were included in repeated classroom PowerPoint presentations, a Snapchat message circulated during the school day that called a Black person the n-word and dehumanized the person by saying “It was here to deliver” an item without a complete investigation or response from the District, and a white student who identified himself as “ nighas ” during a classroom activity using the online platform Kahoot that the teacher did not address, among other allegations of ongoing harassment . The student reported further incidents during the 2022-23 school year, including frequent use of the n-word, a classroom activity using an online platform where a white student identified himself as “Ni99er,” and white students shaking the school bus as Black students were exiting. This persisting harassment resulted in the student attending school remotely . OCR identified concerns that the District : Did not conduct adequate investigations of possible racially harassing conduct; Did not appear to consider the totality of the circumstances and the cumulative effects of the racial harassment; and Did not appear to take steps reasonably designed to prevent the harassment from recurring and remedy the effects of the harassment on students . The resolution agreement commits the District to take steps to ensure that students enrolled at the school are not subjected to a hostile environment on the basis of race. “ The important steps Beecher Community Unit School District 200U has agreed to take to address and prevent racial harassment are designed to ensure that their full school community will learn in the nondiscriminatory environment federal law promises to them , ” said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon. The District ’s commitments in the resolution agreement include: Taking prompt and appropriate responsive action to investigate the allegations that the student and other Black students were harassed on the basis of race during the 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 school years, and remedy the effects of racial harassment on the students, such as offering compensatory education, counseling, and reimbursement for documented private educational expenses for the student’s alternative education, counseling and/or psychological support; Providing all school administrators, faculty, and staff with annual training on the District’s policies and procedures that address racial discrimination and harassment; Providing training to all school employees who receive, or are directly involved in processing, investigating and/or resolving complaints or other reports of discrimination or harassment on the basis of race; Providing a mandatory, annual, age-appropriate orientation session for all school students on the District’s policies and procedures prohibiting racial discrimination and harassment; Developing a school climate survey to administer to students at the school to ensure the school is free of racial harassment; and Maintaining documents relating to specific complaints or other reports of racial harassment of students to ensure that its files contain all information necessary to process complaints under Title VI.

31-May-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-announces-additional-project-serv-grants-hbcus,U.S. Department of Education Announces Additional Project SERV Grants to HBCUs,"The U.S. Department of Education (Department) today announced Project School Emergency Response to Violence (Project SERV) grants to four Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) that were disrupted by bomb threats last year: Texas Southern University in Houston, Texas was awarded $191,962; Delaware State University in Dover, Delaware was awarded $217,000; Claflin University in Orangeburg, South Carolina was awarded $440,000 and Howard University in Washington, D.C. was awarded $203,000. Project SERV provides short-term funding for local educational agencies and institutions of higher education that have experienced a violent or traumatic incident to assist in restoring a safe environment conducive to learning. The Department expects additional grants to be awarded in the coming weeks and continues to work with additional impacted HBCUs to support them in the grant application process and expedite the processing of applications once received. “The bomb threats last year that targeted several Historically Black Colleges and Universities traumatized their campus communities, disrupted learning, and drained resources by prompting costly campus lockdowns, class cancellations, and law enforcement activities,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “The Biden-Harris administration will always stand by HBCUs and unequivocally condemn racist efforts to terrorize Black students and educators and deprive them of their right to safe, welcoming, and nurturing environments for teaching and learning. The Project SERV grants announced today will help four HBCUs directly impacted by these bomb threats to better serve students, faculty, and staff by increasing access to mental health and wellness services and improving other vital supports.” Texas Southern University (TSU) will use its Project SERV funds to provide access to in-person and tele-mental health services for one year, including through access to behavioral health providers. TSU will also use funds for a project coordinator to manage and oversee the project. Delaware State University (DSU) will use its Project SERV funds to develop a Mental Health First Aid Education Program. DSU will also pay for overtime expenses for counselors, social workers, and law enforcement officers to help address safety and health concerns, and to train employees to serve on the Campus Mobile Crisis Team. Claflin University will use its Project SERV funds to hire a licensed clinical social worker, as well as to support trainings focused on stress reduction; provide workshops focused on identifying signs of distress in students and coworkers; and other programs to address stress, anxiety, and safety on campus. Howard University will use its Project SERV funds to hire two case managers who will be responsible for conducting wellness visits and contacting families on an as-needed basis related to student wellness concerns, as well as a full-time field training specialist who will provide security trainings. Additional HBCUs that have been previously awarded Project SERV grants are Tougaloo College, Fayetteville State University, Southern University Law Center, Fisk University, Coppin State University, North Carolina Central University, Philander Smith College, and Hampton University. “These funds are critically important to the safety, security, and well-being of our institutions,” said Dietra Trent, Executive Director of the White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence and Economic Opportunity through Historically Black Colleges and Universities. “HBCU students consider their campuses as a sacred refuge and home away from home, and it is imperative that we provide them with these resources ensuring that they not only feel safe but are safe. It is also incumbent upon us to ensure that the faculty and staff who are dedicated to educating the next generation of leaders are also able to do so with peace of mind. Since day one, the Biden-Harris Administration has been committed to strengthening the HBCU community and the investments that these institutions will make using the Project SERV funds is another example of the strength of that commitment.” The Biden-Harris Administration continues to take a whole-of-government approach to support HBCU campuses. For example, to date, the Department of Education has delivered nearly $7 billion in cumulative investments to HBCUs, including: $3.7 billion through the American Rescue Plan and other COVID relief; $1.6 billion in capital finance debt relief; $2.45 million in Project SERV funds; and $1.5 billion in grant funding to help HBCUs and other MSIs expand capacity."

OCR had concerns that the district did not complete an investigation of serial misconduct and that it did not respond equitably to complaints of sexual assault during the 2017-2018, 2018-2019, and 2019-2020 academic years, including that male respondents may have been treated less favorably than female respondents. OCR also determined that the district violated Title IX by failing to identify a Title IX Coordinator prior to August 2020; failing to adopt and publish Title IX grievance procedures that complied with Title IX; failing to issue a notice of nondiscrimination that complied with Title IX; and failing to adopt recordkeeping practices with regard to Title IX complaints. The district's Title IX policies and procedures were inconsistent with one another and presented information to students, parents and guardians, and administrators in a confusing manner. In addition, the district's files were often incomplete or kept in a manner that did not allow OCR to assess the adequacy of the district's response to Title IX complaints and, ultimately, determine whether the district complied with Title IX. The resolution agreement commits the district to take the steps needed to ensure nondiscrimination on the basis of sex in all of its education programs and activities, including: Designating and identifying its Title IX coordinator(s) and providing Title IX training. Reviewing and revising its Title IX policies and submitting to OCR case file documentation sufficient to show that the district's revised Title IX policies are compliant and effective. Publishing a compliant notice of nondiscrimination. Reviewing all complaints of student and staff Title IX misconduct during the 2017-2018, 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school years to determine – with OCR review and approval – whether additional actions need to be taken to comply with Title IX. And, Surveying students and parents to assess a need for additional changes. ""Mingo County Schools' commitments today to ensure consistent and equitable investigation of and response to possible sexual assault of students in the district's charge, as well as training, staffing, and policy development that fulfill the Title IX mandate, are crucial to ensuring student safety,"" said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon. The letter to Mingo County Schools is available here and the resolution agreement is available here ."

The Departments recognize and appreciate school administrators, teachers, and educational staff across the nation who work to administer student discipline fairly, and to provide a safe, positive, and nondiscriminatory educational environment for all students, teachers, and other educators. The Resource demonstrates the Departments' ongoing commitment to the vigorous enforcement of laws that protect students from discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin in student discipline. The Resource provides examples of the Departments' investigations of such discrimination over the last 10 years, reflecting the long-standing approach and continuity in the Departments' enforcement practices over time and the continuing urgency of assuring nondiscrimination in student discipline in our nation's schools. ""OCR remains committed to ensuring nondiscrimination in disciplinary practices,"" said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon. ""I look forward to ongoing work in, and with, schools to ensure that no student experiences unlawful discrimination, including with respect to discipline."" ""Discrimination in school discipline can have devastating long-term consequences on students and their future opportunities,"" said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division. ""The Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division uses our federal civil rights laws to protect students from discriminatory discipline, including discrimination in suspensions and expulsions, law enforcement referrals and school-based arrests. The investigations that we describe demonstrate how students may experience discrimination based on multiple facets of their identities and reflect our joint commitment to fully protect all students."" The Resource describes how the Departments resolved investigations of 14 school districts in 10 states nationwide – Alabama, Arizona, California, Delaware, Maryland, Minnesota, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Utah. These investigations, conducted under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its regulations, and Title IV of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, involved concerns of discrimination in schools' use of out-of-school suspensions, expulsions, school-based arrests, referrals to law enforcement, involuntary discipline transfers, informal removals, and other discipline against Black, Latino, and/or Native American students. The Resource demonstrates ways school districts can take steps to proactively improve their administration of student discipline. Additionally, the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Elementary and Secondary Education (OESE), Office of Safe & Supportive Schools Technical Assistance Centers released a series of fact sheets on how school leaders and members of school communities may support students' social, emotional, behavioral, and academic well-being and success. The fact sheets are: ""Supporting Students' Social, Emotional, Behavioral, and Academic Well-Being and Success"" through: Strategies for Student and Teacher Support Teams; Strategies for Educators and School-Based Staff; Strategies for Schools to Enhance Relationships with Families; Strategies for School and District Leaders. You can find the fact sheets here.

25-May-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-launches-antisemitism-awareness-campaign,U.S. Department of Education Launches Antisemitism Awareness Campaign,"As the Biden-Harris Administration issues the first-ever U.S. National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism , today, the U.S. Department of Education launched its Antisemitism Awareness Campaign among the first deliverables from the whole-of-society strategy. This effort will bring the full resources of the Department to bear to ensure all students – including Jewish students – are able to attend schools free from discrimination, including harassment. ""Antisemitism has no place in our society, and I am proud that the Department will continue to use all available tools to prevent and address antisemitic discrimination in our nation’s schools,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""No student should have to face discrimination or harassment because of their race, color, national origin, shared ancestry, such as Jewish ancestry, or ethnic characteristics. The U.S. Department of Education is a civil rights agency committed to ensuring all students have access to learning environments that are welcoming, inclusive, and free of discrimination, and we are honored to unveil this awareness campaign as part of the Biden-Harris administration's National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism."" As part of this campaign, the Department’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) today released a Dear Colleague Letter reminding schools of their legal obligations under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI) to provide all students, including students who are or are perceived to be Jewish, a school environment free from discrimination based on race, color, or national origin, including shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics, or citizenship or residency in a country with a dominant religion or religious identity. Schools must take immediate and appropriate action to respond to harassment that creates a hostile environment. OCR generally finds that a hostile environment exists where there is harassing conduct that is sufficiently severe, pervasive, or persistent so as to interfere with or limit the ability of an individual to participate in or benefit from the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school. ""Our office has a longstanding commitment to addressing antisemitic discrimination, including harassment, in the nation’s schools through the enforcement of federal civil rights law,"" said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon. ""Through this Dear Colleague Letter, we seek to ensure that school communities throughout the United States know and fulfill their federal obligations to ensure that Jewish students can access their education without discrimination."" Today’s letter is one of several resources released by OCR to support schools in complying with their obligations under Title VI to address discrimination based on shared ancestry and ethnic characteristics. The letter highlights additional resources in this area, including a fact sheet, Protecting Students from Discrimination Based on Shared Ancestry or Ethnic Characteristics , released in January 2023. Additional resources are available on the Shared Ancestry or Ethnic Characteristics page of OCR’s website. Information about recently resolved complaints under Title VI, including complaints alleging antisemitism, is available here . The Department will also take additional actions as part of this new campaign, including: OCR will continue to collect data on allegations of harassment or bullying based on religion, as it has since the 2013-14 Civil Rights Data Collection. This will include reported allegations of harassment or bullying based on 14 categories of religion, including Judaism. OCR will continue to offer technical assistance to school communities as well as community organizations regarding Title VI, including its application to Jewish students and its coverage of certain forms of antisemitic discrimination. Senior Department officials will conduct site visits to K-12 schools and institutions of higher education that are engaged in their own campaigns to address antisemitism, as well as those that have experienced upticks in antisemitism but have not yet adequately addressed such concerns. The Department will spotlight notable efforts by students, communities, educators, and administrators to prevent and address antisemitism, and will disseminate information about these efforts to offer concrete examples of ways schools and campuses can engage in efforts to prevent and address antisemitism. The Department will raise awareness about its resources that can be utilized to prevent and address antisemitism, such as funding from the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act and resources available through ED’s technical assistance centers. The Department’s Center for Faith-based and Neighborhood Partnerships will spotlight strategies for school and campus communities to be more inclusive of Jewish and other religious identities, such as multifaith student groups or afterschool programs or school-based efforts aimed at fostering cross-community cooperation. The Department will promote technical assistance opportunities to help school and campus communities improve awareness of religious cultures and practices and accommodation of religious observances, including Jewish observances, such as observance of the Jewish Sabbath, major Jewish holidays, and dietary requirements."
24-May-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-secretary-education-miguel-cardona-statement-one-year-uvalde-shooting,U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona Statement on One Year Since the Uvalde Shooting,"Exactly one year since the mass shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona issued the following statement: “One year ago, in Uvalde, Texas, families experienced the horror of learning their precious loved ones were among the 19 fourth graders and two educators killed in a mass shooting at Robb Elementary School, along with 17 others seriously injured. “In the wake of this tragedy, the U.S. Department of Education pledged that Uvalde would not have to shoulder this burden alone, and that we would use every resource available to support them in every way possible. One year later, the needs in Uvalde remain significant. In addition to the $1.5 million we provided last year to support their immediate needs, we are continuing our commitment with another $1.5 million Project SERV grant to help students, families, and educators continue coping with this grief and trauma as the district works to restore a sense of safety in their schools. “We cannot fathom the unspeakable pain these families and the community have endured over the last year. We cannot accept a status quo in which our educators have to teach our children how to run, hide, and fight before they learn to read. We cannot ignore that America is the only country where guns are the number one killer of children and teens. “I am proud of the long overdue investments in school safety and mental health made possible by the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which President Biden signed into law last year. We as a nation, must do more. Military-style weapons have turned far too many schools and communities into battlefields, and as President Biden has made clear, we need stronger, commonsense gun violence prevention laws. “I will never forget my visit to Uvalde, mourning with the families and teachers, and listening to their desperate pleas for action. I pray for them, and I pray for our nation’s lawmakers to put the lives of children ahead of the gun industry.” To continue support for the Uvalde community, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) is awarding an additional $1.5 million in School Emergency Response to Violence (Project SERV) grant funding to the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District (UCISD) to support the district’s ongoing recovery efforts. The funding will help sustain activities currently funded by the $1.5 million Project SERV grant the district received last year in the immediate wake of the tragedy. Following last year’s tragedy, Secretary Cardona visited Uvalde and initiated emergency funding to meet critical needs in the district and broader community. Since the tragedy, Secretary Cardona and other Department staff communicated with UCISD leadership and their Texas Education Agency colleagues and pledged to support district recovery efforts in the district and community with a range of technical assistance, including direct access to Department personnel and partners who have helped other school districts navigate, respond to, and recover after acts of school violence. Project SERV funds are authorized under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and may be used for activities that help restore a sense of safety and security for the district’s students, teachers, staff, and families, and that address specific needs of those individuals directly affected by the shooting. Such activities include providing mental health services for staff and students; overtime pay for teachers, counselors, and security staff; and the activities may take place over the summer in the form of additional summer programming. Because of lives lost in Buffalo and Uvalde and the courageous advocacy of the victims’ families and survivors of these shootings, and so many other acts of gun violence, President Biden worked with Congress to enact the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA), the most significant gun safety legislation in nearly 30 years. Among other investments, BSCA provides $1 billion in Stronger Connections Grant Program funding to support states, districts, and schools in establishing safe, healthy, and supportive learning environments. With this funding, states must develop competitions for high-need local educational agencies to apply for funding, which they may use for purposes such as expanding school-based mental health services, providing safety and violence prevention programs, addressing the physical security of schools, and creating and implementing emergency operating plans. Most states are in the process of running these competitions and awarding these grants now. The Department has also made nearly $300 million in awards to date for school-based mental health supports for schools, which are projected to prepare an additional 14,000 mental health professionals for America’s schools. And, on May 18, 2023, the Department and HHS announced additional actions that will make it easier for schools to bill Medicaid to deliver necessary health services, including mental health services, to students."
24-May-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-shares-insights-and-recommendations-artificial-intelligence,U.S. Department of Education Shares Insights and Recommendations for Artificial Intelligence,"Today, the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Educational Technology (OET) released a new report, ""Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Future of Teaching and Learning: Insights and Recommendations"" that summarizes the opportunities and risks for AI in teaching, learning, research, and assessment based on public input. This report is part of the Biden-Harris Administration's ongoing effort to advance a cohesive and comprehensive approach to AI-related opportunities and risks. The new report addresses the clear need for sharing knowledge, engaging educators and communities, and refining technology plans and policies for AI use in education. It recognizes AI as a rapidly advancing set of technologies that can enable new forms of interaction between educators and students, help educators address variability in learning, increase feedback loops, and support educators. It also outlines risks associated with AI—including algorithmic bias—and the importance of trust, safety, and appropriate guardrails to protect educators and students. The report recommends that the Department continue working with states, institutions of higher education, school districts and other partners to collaborate on the following steps: Emphasize Humans-in-the-Loop Align AI Models to a Shared Vision for Education Design AI Using Modern Learning Principles Prioritize Strengthening Trust Inform and Involve Educators Focus R&D on Addressing Context and Enhancing Trust and Safety Develop Education-specific Guidelines and Guardrails To gather information and formulate insights, OET partnered with Digital Promise , a global nonprofit that works to expand opportunities for every learner. Over 700 educational stakeholders participated in a series of four public listening sessions in summer 2022. Stakeholders described promising opportunities they see for AI in education and discussed risks–especially risks of algorithmic bias–and called for stronger educational technology guidance. The Biden-Harris Administration remains committed to addressing the increasingly urgent need to leverage technology in the education sector and promote novel and impactful ways to bring together educators, researchers, and developers to craft better policies. OET looks forward to leading further work to align AI models to a shared vision for education, inform and involve educators, and develop education-specific guidelines and guardrails.

Specifically, the agreement enhances and expands the agencies’ longstanding partnership that promotes science, technology, engineering, and math education to students from diverse backgrounds so they have opportunities to pursue interests and careers in STEM and space industries. It reinforces the importance of Biden-Harris Administration priorities for STEM, climate, space exploration, and Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility. ""I am excited for this partnership with NASA that will inspire and prepare young people from all backgrounds to become our next generation of leaders in STEM fields and to propel our nation and our workforce into the future,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""From the groundbreaking Apollo mission to today’s Artemis program, which will land the first woman and first person of color on the Moon, NASA’s work has long galvanized the world to raise the bar and reach for new heights. I am proud that our agencies will continue to intentionally collaborate to enrich STEM teaching and learning in America’s classrooms; expand access to high-quality, hands-on career, technical, and space education; increase the capacity and diversity of our nation’s STEM educator workforce; and so much more."" “The first humans who will walk on Mars and the innovators who will help humanity reach the Red Planet are students in America’s classrooms today. NASA and the Department of Education know we need the whole of the Artemis Generation – young people from all parts of America and all walks of life – to achieve big goals, overcome our greatest challenges, and inspire the world through science and discovery,” said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. “Today’s signing, with the support of Vice President Harris and the National Space Council, continues NASA’s collaborative efforts with the Department of Education to amplify the excitement of space to all students across our country, allowing every young person to know they are a part of the Artemis Generation – today and for decades to come.” Both agencies participate on the White House National Science and Technology Council Committee on STEM Education, and the White House National Space Council.

Over the last two years, the Department has engaged in a rigorous deliberative process with the PRDE, other local government agencies, and community stakeholders in addition to providing unprecedented technical assistance and support to the PRDE. This announcement reflects an enhanced strategy to overcome the system's challenges to ensure that students and families are benefitting from a school system that responds directly to their needs. ""The important actions announced today will lead to a better tomorrow for students and families across Puerto Rico,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""I applaud Governor Pedro Pierluisi for taking this bold step to decentralize Puerto Rico's education system, because we know that students do better when schools are responsive to young people's needs and when they partner directly with the parents, families, and communities they serve. The Department stands ready to support this transition and to intentionally collaborate with the PRDE to reimagine Puerto Rico's school system and transform it into one that is truly capable of putting students first."" The PRDE, the sixth largest school district in the nation, currently operates as a unitary education system. This means that the PRDE serves as both the State Educational Agency (SEA) and the Local Educational Agency (LEA). Few other educational jurisdictions operate under this structure -- specifically, Hawai'i, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa – and all of them have significantly smaller populations. ""Our goal is to enable the decentralization of our education system so that all our students, as well as their parents, and their teachers, can have the confidence that their school can respond directly to their needs and aspirations. We want the day-to-day decisions to be made at the regional level and the resources to reach our children directly in the public education system,"" said Puerto Rico Governor Pedro Pierluisi. ""Moreover, to prove that we are taking action quickly, in addition to the expanded set of school supplies and materials that every school will receive, at the beginning of next semester each school principal will have a debit card that will allow them to make purchases directly for the supplies they need, because we want our children to focus on learning and our teachers to focus on teaching from the first day of school."" ""We want to thank the United States Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona and Governor Pedro Pierluisi for always prioritizing progress for our public education system. At the Puerto Rico Department of Education, we have begun to work towards streamlining processes so that this notice of decentralization can adapt to our schools' reality. Our main priority and our work is geared towards allocating the necessary resources to our schools and communities, with diligence and efficiency, to provide the best education for our children and youth. We will be allies in this joint effort that, without a doubt, will be a step forward for our schools,"" said Puerto Rico Secretary of Education Eliezer Ramos Parés. Today's announcement means Puerto Rico will launch the Initiative of Decentralization of Education and Autonomy of Regions (IDEAR) that will begin the process of implementing a decentralized model. Under this model, Puerto Rico will establish a new system structure that separates the SEA and LEA functions. The IDEAR will deliver a plan to the Puerto Rico Secretary of Education and Governor within 90 days, detailing both the short- and long-term milestones towards decentralization. The plan will be developed through a collaborative process that engages students, teachers, and education stakeholders to ensure that efforts are teacher-responsive and student-centered. Once fully implemented, decentralization will facilitate the swift and effective deployment of federal resources and promote increased autonomy for regions and schools, resulting in greater opportunity and outcomes for the students of Puerto Rico. This system transformation is a historic commitment from the Government of Puerto Rico to the children and families of the Island to reimagine a school system that will better prepare students as key contributors to Puerto Rico's health and prosperity. Over the last two years, the Biden-Harris Administration has prioritized supporting the students of Puerto Rico through our pandemic responses. Within months of taking office, in June 2021, Secretary Cardona formed the Puerto Rico Education Sustainability (PRES) team at the U.S. Department of Education to help Puerto Rico administer the unprecedented $3 billion in funding provided by the $130 billion in American Rescue Plan (ARP) funds for K-12 education. In total, the Biden-Harris Administration has released some $4.9 billion to Puerto Rico since taking office. This includes: $3 billion from the American Rescue Plan Act; and $1.2 billion from the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2021 (CRRSA). Additionally, the Department awards some $600+ million in annual program grants each fiscal year. In July 2022, public school teachers on the Island started receiving a $1,000 monthly salary increase that was made possible through ARP funding. This is a 30 percent increase for the average teacher in Puerto Rico. Earlier this year, the Department approved the PRDE's use of ARP funds for short column repairs at schools impacted by natural disasters. This funding is helping to accelerate repairs that will make schools and classrooms safer and accessible for educators and students. In June 2022, the Department also released a comprehensive technical assistance plan that was developed collaboratively with the PRDE and responds directly to the programmatic and fiscal needs of PRDE staff in the management of federal programs and funds. And in December 2022, as part of the first-ever Puerto Rico Economic Dialogue hosted by the White House, the Department and the PRDE announced partnerships to build administrative capacity, improve management across Puerto Rico's school system and strengthen career pathways for Puerto Rico's students. hosted by the White House, the Department and the PRDE announced partnerships to build administrative capacity, improve management across Puerto Rico's school system and strengthen career pathways for Puerto Rico's students. The Department stands ready to support the PRDE in this historic transition to a 21st century school system that is well-situated to meet the needs and address the challenges of educating a robust workforce that can contribute to the betterment of Puerto Rico.

The district received complaints from some parents and community members about the district providing students access to library books that parents deemed inappropriate because they contained sexually explicit content. One parent group asked the district to shelve LGBTQI+ books separately in school libraries. In addition, communications at the district school board meetings conveyed the impression that books were being screened to exclude diverse authors and characters, including people who are LGBTQI+ and authors who are not white, causing students to express concerns about the impact of the book removals. OCR received a complaint challenging this district's library book removal as having created a racially and sexually hostile environment for students. OCR investigates every complaint over which it has jurisdiction and resolved this investigation on the specific facts in this district. School and other libraries routinely operate policies to determine which books to offer their members; this district's policy not only did not raise Title VI or Title IX concerns but specifically was designed to ensure diverse and inclusive offerings to students in the district. Although the district limited its library book screening process to sexually explicit material and posted a statement that it provides resources ""that reflect all students within each school community,"" OCR's investigation identified concerns that: Communications at the board meetings provided the district notice that its library book screening process may have created a hostile environment for students. And, The district's responsive steps related to the library book screening process were not sufficient to ameliorate any resultant racially and sexually hostile environment. To resolve OCR's concerns, the district committed to: Issue a statement to students in the district explaining the library book removal process and offer supportive measures to students who may have been impacted by that process. Administer a climate survey of the student bodies at each of the district's middle and high schools to assess whether additional steps need to be taken. And, Implement ongoing monitoring until OCR is satisfied that the federal laws at issue are satisfied. ""I thank Forsyth County Schools for assessing and responding to the needs of the students who may have felt subjected to a hostile environment as a result of the library book screening process and for ensuring that, going forward, it will take appropriate action regarding acts of harassment that create a hostile environment based on sex, race, color or national origin,"" said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon. The letter to Forsyth County Schools is available here and the resolution agreement is available here ."
19-May-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-releases-report-state-school-diversity-announces-new-grant-opportunity,"U.S. Department of Education Releases Report on State of School Diversity, Announces New Grant Opportunity","This week, as the nation commemorates the 69th anniversary of the landmark Brown v. Board of Education unanimous Supreme Court ruling that declared racially segregated schools unequal and unconstitutional, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) is releasing a new report on the state of diversity within America's schools. Based on currently available Department data and a review of educational and economic research, the report finds that progress toward increased racial and socio-economic diversity has stalled in many communities as segregation patterns have persisted, leading to inequitable access and outcomes for students. Diverse schools benefit all students, helping to foster performance and success through improved academic achievement, social mobility, civic engagement, empathy, and understanding. The Department also recently released a Notice Inviting Applications (NIA) for the first-ever Fostering Diverse Schools Demonstration Program, which will award $10 million to local and state agencies to voluntarily develop or implement plans to increase diversity in schools. The State of School Diversity report responds to a Congressional directive asking the Department to examine and publicly release information on racial and economic segregation within the United States' K-12 educational systems using existing Department data. Report includes data that shows students of color disproportionately attend schools with majority students of color populations. According to federal data, three in five Black and Latino students and two in five American Indian/Alaska Native students attend schools where at least 75% of students are students of color, whereas about half of white students attend schools in which students of color make up less than 25% of the student population. Despite research suggesting the wide-ranging benefits associated with attending racially and socioeconomically integrated schools, isolation in schools continues. ""Nearly 70 years after the Brown v. Board decision declared segregation in our public schools unconstitutional, we cannot ignore the powerful role that race, place, and income continue to play in access to educational opportunity in America,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""At a time when some are trying to turn ‘equity' into a bad word, we must recognize that the racial and socioeconomic isolation that persists in our public schools undermines our national competitiveness by denying students of all backgrounds the rich educational experiences that result from diverse learning environments. I am proud that, as we commemorate 69 years since Brown , the Biden-Harris Administration is launching a new grant program to support innovative, voluntary local efforts aimed at building more socioeconomically diverse school communities and raising the bar for all students."" Schools that are isolated along racial or socioeconomic lines often have less access to critical resources and funding. These conditions can perpetuate gaps in opportunity that can limit the chance for underserved students to grow and excel academically. The Biden-Harris Administration has put academic acceleration at the forefront of its agenda, with record levels of investment in K-12 schools since day one, and is committed to efforts to champion and promote diverse schools through grant funding to help fuel voluntary and legal efforts to create plans and implement strategies to increase diversity in classrooms in schools. Well-designed efforts to improve school diversity can increase access to critical resources students need to succeed, such as experienced educators and advanced coursework. Every student should have access to high-quality learning experiences, and diverse schools can help enable them to happen. The new Fostering Diverse Schools Demonstration program will provide students with access to a well-rounded education and improve school conditions for student learning by voluntarily developing or implementing comprehensive plans for increasing school socioeconomic diversity in preschool through grade 12. The Department invites applicants to submit locally tailored plans to encourage socioeconomic diversity in schools, courses, and programs. Applicants may also propose to voluntarily foster diversity more broadly by considering legally permissible strategies for promoting diversity as it relates to factors such as race/ethnicity, culture, and geography. The actions of the Department of Education to increase diversity in schools through investments, accountability, oversight, civil rights enforcement, and ongoing technical support remain pivotal. The Department continues to encourage states and districts to renew efforts to provide more equitable access to the important resources that we know make a difference in educational opportunity and outcomes–including high-quality and experienced educators, early childhood education, rigorous coursework, and equitable and adequate school funding. This report and the NIA are part of the Department's ongoing efforts to implement President Biden's Day One Executive Order to advance racial equity and support for underserved communities across the federal government and build our schools and communities back better than before the pandemic. The Department's Office for Civil Rights has long shared guidance , available in multiple languages, regarding civil rights obligations in school communities that receive federal funds to ensure that they make education equally available to all students.

18-May-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-takes-action-help-schools-deliver-critical-health-care-services-millions-students,Biden-Harris Administration Takes Action to Help Schools Deliver Critical Health Care Services to Millions of Students,"Today, on the Mental Health Awareness Day of Action, the Biden-Harris Administration is taking bold action to make it easier for schools to provide critical health care services, especially mental health services, for millions of students across the nation. These three significant actions support President Biden's comprehensive national mental health strategy and deliver on his commitment to tackle the nation's mental health crisis as part of his Unity Agenda. Through a series of new announcements from the U.S. Departments of Education (ED) and Health and Human Services (HHS), the Administration is continuing to take a whole-of-government approach to meet families where they are and ensure that children have access to the health care they need – especially mental health services. Specifically, ED is proposing a new rule that would streamline Medicaid billing permissions for students with disabilities. ED predicts of the 500,000 new students who are found eligible under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) Part B each year, nearly 300,000 are likely to be eligible for Medicaid and impacted by this rule. HHS is issuing new guidance to make it easier for schools to bill Medicaid. HHS also is approving requests from New Mexico and Oregon to expand health care services that schools can deliver to Medicaid enrolled students. ""Students are six times more likely to access mental health when these services are offered in school, and that's one important reason why making it easier for schools to provide health care is at the heart of the Biden-Harris Administration's efforts to address the youth mental health crisis and raise the bar for learning conditions in our schools,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""These new resources and proposed rules will help schools live up to the promise that all students, including those with disabilities, receive a free, appropriate public education. We need to continue breaking down barriers that have long undermined state and local efforts to provide health care services to students, including those covered by Medicaid. Ultimately, more children and youth will gain access to the physical and mental health services they need to succeed in school and in life as a result of the actions the Biden-Harris Administration is taking today."" ""We are taking bold actions to strengthen school-based health care services through our Medicaid program so that children in every community have the support they need,"" said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra. ""President Biden has made clear that strengthening youthmental health is a top priority of this Administration. We are working across the federal government, as well as with all states, territories and tribes, to meet families where they are and provide students with the services and supports they need to be healthy and thrive."" IDEA Act Notice of Proposed Rulemaking ED is releasing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking under IDEA that would streamline consent provisions when billing for Medicaid services provided through a student's individualized education program (IEP). This would result in a uniform process applicable to all Medicaid enrolled children, regardless of disability. Many children with disabilities receiving services under the IDEA are also enrolled in Medicaid either due to their disability status and/or based on their family income. Children with disabilities and are more likely to have low income, and those covered by Medicaid are more likely to have greater health care needs than those who are covered by private insurance. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic reduced access to critical services for children with disabilities and other vulnerable populations. To meet the Administration's goal of increasing access to health and mental health services, and in fulfillment of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA) provision of expanding access to crucial school-based services for mental health and other care needs, it is crucial to remove barriers for schools so they can more easily provide Medicaid covered services to their students enrolled in Medicaid. Importantly, the proposed changes announced today do not alter any of the critical parental consent provisions required by IDEA nor do they impact the parental consent obligations under the Family Educational Records and Privacy Act (FERPA). Additionally, the proposed rule does not alter the requirement that IEP services must be delivered at no cost to the child's family, the requirement that IEP services cannot diminish other Medicaid-reimbursable services, nor Medicaid's position as payor of first resort for IEP and Individualized Family Service Plan services. Rather, this regulatory change would help cut unnecessary red tape that schools and districts face in billing Medicaid and meet their obligations to ensure students with disabilities receive a free, appropriate public education in accordance with their IEP. Guide to Expand School-Based Services for Millions of Students Today, HHS, through the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is releasing a comprehensive guide for Medicaid school-based services to make it easier for schools to deliver and receive payment for health care services to millions of eligible students. Developed in consultation with ED, the Comprehensive Guide to Medicaid Services and Administrative Claiming represents an important part of the Biden-Harris Administration's implementation of the BSCA. In addition to providing billions in funding for school-based mental health personnel and supports to create safe and welcoming school environments, BSCA charged ED and HHS to expand access to school-based health and behavioral health services. The guide released today outlines flexibilities states can adopt to make it easier for schools to get paid for these critical health services delivered to children enrolled in Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), which together provide health coverage to more than half of all children in the United States. ""With this guide, we are helping states and schools bring health care to kids where they are, rather than the other way around,"" said CMS Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure. ""Children spend most of their waking hours in school. We also know that children have suffered serious declines in access to mental and behavioral health care services during the COVID-19 pandemic. We're making it easier for states and schools to maximize Medicaid coverage to grow connections to care."" Medicaid and CHIP cover more than half of all children in this country. That's more than 41 million children spending over 30 hours weekly in school during most of the year. This comprehensive policy guide helps states and schools leverage Medicaid and CHIP and offers a roadmap of how they can build a bridge between education and health care, including mental health care, to support children enrolled in these programs and help them thrive. The guide clarifies, consolidates, and expands on a wealth of CMS guidance on how schools can receive payment for providing care for Medicaid- and CHIP-enrolled students, and how states can ease the administrative burden on school-based health providers to promote their participation in Medicaid and CHIP while meeting federal statutory and regulatory requirements. This includes helping states and schools operationalize: How payments can be made for school-based services under Medicaid and CHIP; How states can simplify billing for school-based services, including in rural and small or under-resourced communities, where care may be particularly challenging. Examples of approved methods that state agencies have used to pay for covered services; and How to enroll qualified health care providers to participate in Medicaid and furnish services within school settings. In the months to come, CMS plans to release more resources to help ensure states can optimize children's access to school-based services. As outlined by BSCA, these resources include $50 million in grant opportunities and a school-based services technical assistancecenter, in partnership with ED. For more information on the guide, visit Medicaid.gov . New Mexico and Oregon School-based Services Expansion Approval HHS, through CMS, also approved state plan amendments (SPAs) for both New Mexico and Oregon that will allow Medicaid to pay for health care services schools delivered to more of their Medicaid-enrolled students. Specifically, these SPAs will allow New Mexico and Oregon to receive Medicaid funding for services provided to all children covered by Medicaid, rather than only those children with an IEP. These approvals expand access to school-based health services, a key priority for the Biden-Harris Administration, that will strengthen Medicaid and help provide resources to combat the youth mental health crisis. New Mexico and Oregon join 12 other states that have already expanded Medicaid payment for school-based health care services under their state plans. These states include: Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, and North Carolina. These announcements collectively are part of the Biden-Harris Administration's commitment to addressing the nation's mental health crisis by providing more school-based resources and supports to help address students' mental health needs. Today's announcement comes on the heels of ED's announcement earlier this week on the latest tranche of awards to train school-based mental health professionals through the Mental Health Service Professionals demonstration program, which provided another nearly $100 million in awards as part of an overall appropriation of $1 billion in BSCA for school-based mental health services and supports. Collectively, these announcements build on actions HHS, CMS and ED have taken over the last year to expand access to school-based health care and trauma informed services. Last summer, CMS released guidance for states on to strengthen the delivery of Medicaid and Children Health Insurance Program (CHIP) youth behavioral health services and school-based services. Last fall, ED announced the Stronger Connections Grant program, which provided awards totaling $1 billion to 56 states and territories through BSCA to help schools in high-need districts provide students with safe, welcoming, and supportive learningopportunities and environments that are critical for their success. Last winter, HHS also awarded nearly $245 million to expand trauma informed services and supports for students and their families, including grants to State and Local Education Activities to bolster school-based services. And at the beginning of the 2022 – 2023 school year, Secretary of Education Dr. Miguel Cardona and Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra sent a letter to governors across the country to highlight federal resources available to states and schools to invest in mental health services for students. ED also awarded $122 billion in American Rescue Plan Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief funds to help schools reopen and recover, and experts indicate more than $2 billion has been directed to hire more school psychologists, counselors, and other mental health professionals in K-12 schools. With the help of these funds, as of March 2023, compared with the pre-pandemic period, the number of school social workers is up 48%, the number of school nurses is up 42%, and the numbers of school counselors and school psychologists are each up 10%."
17-May-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/department-education-releases-proposed-rules-accountability-certificate-and-profit-programs-and-transparency-unaffordable-student-debt,Department of Education Releases Proposed Rules on Accountability for Certificate and For-Profit Programs and Transparency into Unaffordable Student Debt,"Today, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) released proposed regulations to establish the strongest set of safeguards ever to protect students from unaffordable debt or insufficient earnings from career training programs, along with new measures to increase transparency across all postsecondary programs. The proposal would create the strongest-ever Gainful Employment (GE) rule, which would terminate access to Federal financial aid for career training programs that routinely leave graduates with unaffordable debt burdens or with earnings that are no higher than workers without any education beyond high school. The proposed GE rule is estimated to protect more than 700,000 students annually who would otherwise enroll in one of nearly 1,800 low-performing programs, because access to postsecondary programs that produce poor outcomes is not really access at all. These accountability measures will not only better protect students enrolled in low-financial-value programs, but will also encourage improvements across all of higher education. The proposed regulations would also bring increased transparency to the true costs and financial outcomes of nearly all undergraduate and graduate degree programs. This includes disclosures of what students and families are likely to pay out-of-pocket for a given program and a requirement that students acknowledge this information before receiving federal financial aid to attend programs that consistently leave participants with high debt burdens. ""President Biden has taken unprecedented steps to fix our broken student loan system and help millions of Americans struggling with student debt, creating new opportunities for borrowers, their families, and their communities. At the same time, we need to hold colleges accountable for unaffordable costs and better protect students from programs that fail to deliver real value and upward mobility,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""The rules proposed today are about helping ensure that when students invest in a postsecondary education, they get a solid return on investment and a greater shot at the American dream."" Today's announcement is part of the Biden-Harris Administration's ambitious reimagining of college finance to ensure that all students can afford to get the education and skills they need after high school. President Biden has championed a $900 increase to the maximum Pell Grant and laid out a path to doubling the maximum award by 2029. He has also proposed tuition-free community college and tuition assistance at Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal Colleges and Universities, and Minority-Serving Institutions. The Department has fixed targeted debt relief programs like Public Service Loan Forgiveness and relief for borrowers whose colleges took advantage of them, approving more than $66 billion in discharges for nearly 2.2 million borrowers so far. In the coming months we will finalize the most affordable repayment plan ever. Today's proposed rules complement these efforts by ensuring that institutions of higher education (institutions) do their part to deliver real financial value to students and taxpayers. ""We cannot turn a blind eye to the college programs that are leaving students with mountains of unaffordable debts,"" said Under Secretary James Kvaal. ""The data show that the problem is concentrated at for-profit and career colleges. This package of accountability proposals would create the strongest-ever protections for students and taxpayers against low-value, debt-fueled colleges."" More detail on the components of the proposed regulations is below. Gainful Employment The Higher Education Act requires that certificate programs at all institutions and degree programs at private for-profit colleges must provide training that prepares students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation. The regulations propose that programs covered by this requirement would have to meet certain performance standards on two measures to maintain access to Federal financial aid. Specifically, programs would have to show that: Graduates can afford their yearly debt payments. In particular, the share of their annual earnings needed to devote to paying their debt (i.e., their ""debt-to-earnings ratio"") must be equal to or less than 8 percent, or equal to or less than 20 percent of their discretionary earnings (i.e., their annual earnings above 150 percent of the Federal poverty guideline). At least half of graduates have higher earnings than a typical high school graduate in their State's labor force who never pursued a postsecondary education. Programs would be assessed separately on each metric. Programs that fail at least one metric would need to warn students that the program is at risk of losing access to Federal aid. Those that fail to meet the standards on the same metric twice in a three-year period would lose access to Federal aid. Transparency on Financial Value for All Students and Families The proposed rules also give students and families detailed and consistent information across all sectors and levels of postsecondary education about what they are likely to pay for postsecondary programs, how much they are likely to earn after completing a credential, and whether they are selecting a program that is likely to leave them with unaffordable debt. To that end, the regulation proposes to collect new information on all colleges and programs about costs (including tuition and fees, books, and supplies), non-Federal grant aid, typical borrowing amounts (both private and Federal loans), earnings, any applicable occupational and licensing requirements, and licensure exam passage rates (where relevant). This information would be made publicly available on a website run by the Department, and students would need to acknowledge viewing these disclosures before receiving loans to attend programs that consistently leave participants with high debt burdens. In addition to these proposed regulations, the Department will be creating a separate watch list of the least financially valuable postsecondary education programs, focusing on the programs that play an outsized role in burdening graduates with unaffordable debts. The watch list will build on the data collected under the proposed rule and will be finalized through separate Department actions. Other provisions The rules also propose changes to three other regulatory areas that would strengthen the Department's ability to engage in targeted and proactive accountability to protect students, borrowers, and taxpayers. This is particularly important in addressing the large number of colleges that have closed suddenly in recent years, leaving behind significant unpaid liabilities for discharged loans. These proposed rules also better align the Department's tools for overseeing colleges with other Department regulations and the work of other Federal agencies, States, and accrediting agencies. These other regulatory areas are: Financial Responsibility , which includes proposals to make it easier for the Department to secure upfront financial protection when risky colleges start to exhibit signs of financial struggle, such as when an institution incurs significant debts or liabilities from a lawsuit or is at risk of losing access to Federal financial aid programs. Administrative Capability , which includes proposals to increase requirements for colleges to provide adequate career services and clearer financial aid information, and to limit the employment of individuals with a past history of risky behavior or misconduct related to the Federal financial aid programs. Certification Procedures , which includes proposals to make it easier for the Department to incorporate stronger safeguards into its written agreements with institutions for participating in Federal financial aid programs. These proposals also protect students by allowing the Department to require teach-out plans or agreements when a college is at risk of closure. Finally, the regulations contain consensus language agreed to during negotiated rulemaking in Spring 2022 that will revise Ability to Benefit rules. These are provisions related to how students without a high school diploma may access Federal aid. In particular, the regulations would provide a more streamlined process for States to approve postsecondary opportunities for these students. Next steps The proposed regulations will be published in the Federal Register on May 19, 2023. The public may submit comments on the proposed rule through the Regulations.gov website for 30 days. The Department expects to finalize the rules later this year. Under the master calendar requirements of the Higher Education Act, rules finalized by November 1, 2023, will go into effect on July 1, 2024. View al copy of proposed regulations here . A fact sheet on the GE and transparency parts of the rules can be found here and a fact sheet on the other provisions in the regulatory package are here . The Department is also releasing a version of the data that was used to model the effects of the proposed gainful employment and financial transparency rules in the Regulatory Impact Analysis, which can be found on this page ."

The awards were funded by the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA), which President Biden signed into law on June 25, 2022, and they help advance the Administration's efforts to tackle the mental health crisis in our schools as part of his National Mental Health Strategy. The Department of Education (Department) has awarded $286 million across 264 grantees in 48 states and territories to boost the training, hiring, and diversification of mental health professionals through two grants – the School-Based Mental Health (SBMH) grant program and Mental Health Service Professional (MHSP) grant program – in President Biden’s Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. Grantees estimate that these funds collectively will prepare more than 14,000 new mental health professionals for America’s schools. A state-by-state breakdown of these projections is included below. Today’s announcement of 93 additional MHSP awards, following the awarding of $46 million to 67 grantees in December, means that the Department will fund a total of 160 MHSP grantees across the country who will train and place thousands of diverse and certified mental health providers in schools with the most need. Nearly half (45 percent) of MHSP grantees proposed a partnership with a Minority Serving Institution, Historically Black College or University or Tribal College or University. In February, the Department also announced $141 million in SBMH grants, which supports districts in hiring mental health professionals. The Department is also announcing up to $2.6 million in funding for a new Mental Health Personnel Technical Assistance Center to support MHSP and SBMH grantees in meeting the goals of their grant. This Center will help identify and develop resources both for SBMH and MHSP grantees to support grantees in addressing the social, emotional, and mental health needs of PK-12 students and staff. The Center will also provide support to the field more broadly – to grantees and beyond – by disseminating best practices in recruiting, training, placing, and retaining school-based mental health services providers. These historic investments are made possible because of funds provided under BSCA. Over the next five years, the Department will invest the remainder of the $1 billion provided by BSCA in mental health professionals for schools through the MHSP and SBMH programs, helping advance the President's goal, as part of his Mental Health Strategy , to double the number of school counselors, social workers, and other school-based mental health professionals. These funds have the potential to meaningfully change lives by building a mental health infrastructure in schools and communities across the country. These grants complement $1 billion BSCA funds to support safe school environments through the Stronger Connections grant program through evidence-based strategies that advance equity and support student social, emotional, physical, and mental well-being.

10-May-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/statement-us-secretary-education-miguel-cardona-senate-confirmation-glenna-wright-gallo,Statement by U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona on Senate Confirmation of Glenna Wright-Gallo,"The Senate has confirmed Glenna Wright-Gallo as assistant secretary for special education and rehabilitative services at the U.S. Department of Education. Secretary Cardona issued the following statement: “I am thrilled that Glenna Wright-Gallo, a lifelong educator and accomplished special education leader, has been successfully confirmed as the Department of Education’s new assistant secretary for special education and rehabilitative services. Ms. Wright-Gallo has spent decades supporting students with disabilities and their families both in the classroom and as an administrative leader in the Utah and Washington public education systems. Her commitment to meeting the needs of the special education community and strong track record of improving outcomes are exactly what we need at this critical moment in our recovery from the pandemic, and I look to working with her to raise the bar for students with disabilities and their families.” About Glenna Wright-Gallo Glenna Wright-Gallo has served as the assistant superintendent of special education in the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) in Washington since 2017. Prior to that, she spent seven years as the state director of special education for the Utah State Board of Education, following work as a classroom teacher and administrator. She has over 25 years of public education experience supporting students with disabilities and adults entering and within the teaching profession, and 16 years of experience in state-level education leadership with expertise in the improvement planning, data analysis, and monitoring of public P-12+ special education programs. Glenna has bachelor of science and master of science degrees in special education; special education teacher and administrative licenses; endorsements as a program administrator, principal, and superintendent; and a master of business administration. During her work in Washington, state special education programs were allocated an additional $155 million, $37 million for improvement of statewide inclusionary practices, $12 million for paraeducator training, and $60,000 to reduce the use of restraint and isolation. During her tenure, the historic state special education funding allocation formula was revised to a two-tier system that now supports inclusionary practices, and the state’s high-needs risk pool process also was revised to reduce administrative burden on school districts. Collaboration is a priority for her work, and collaborative efforts were infused within all state efforts regarding students with disabilities. Glenna feels strongly that application of the intent of IDEA requirements results in increased student outcomes for students with disabilities. She works with school and district administrators; special education staff; advocates; and parents and families of students with disabilities at the local, state, and national levels to review research, current student achievement data, stakeholder feedback, and compliance data to ensure state and local efforts are addressing instructional issues that impact results for students with disabilities."
10-May-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-announces-161-students-be-honored-2023-us-presidential-scholars,U.S. Department of Education Announces 161 Students to be Honored as 2023 U.S. Presidential Scholars,"U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona today announced the 59th class of U.S. Presidential Scholars, recognizing 161 high school seniors for their accomplishments in academics, the arts, and career and technical education fields. The White House Commission on Presidential Scholars selects scholars annually based on their academic success, artistic and technical excellence, essays, school evaluations and transcripts, as well as a demonstrated commitment to community service and leadership. Of the 3.7 million students expected to graduate from high school this year, more than 5,000 candidates qualified for the 2023 awards determined by outstanding performance on the College Board SAT or ACT exams or through nominations made by chief state school officers, other partner recognition organizations and YoungArts , the National Foundation for the Advancement of Artists. As directed by Presidential Executive Order, the 2023 U.S. Presidential Scholars are comprised of one young man and one young woman from each state, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, and U.S. families living abroad, as well as 15 chosen at-large, 20 scholars in the arts and 20 scholars in career and technical education. Created in 1964, the U.S. Presidential Scholars Program has honored over 8,000 of the nation's top-performing students. The program was expanded in 1979 to recognize students who demonstrate exceptional talent in the visual, literary and performing arts. In 2015, the program was again extended to recognize students who demonstrate ability and accomplishment in career and technical education fields.

10-May-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-calls-colleges-universities-and-schools-partner-addressing-k-12-learning-loss-announces-initial-cohort-committed-partners,"Biden-Harris Administration Calls on Colleges, Universities, and Schools to Partner in Addressing K-12 Learning Loss, Announces Initial Cohort of Committed Partners","Today, the U.S. Department of Education released a Dear Colleague Letter calling on colleges, universities, and school districts to work together to use Federal Work Study (FWS) or other resources to increase the number of college students supporting school-aged children and youth in our nation’s K-12 schools and out-of-school time programs. With this call to action and as a part of its work with AmeriCorps and Johns Hopkins University through the National Partnership for Student Success (NPSS), the Department is pleased to announce the first cohort of 26 early adopter colleges and universities that have committed to using Federal Work Study or other resources to increase the number of students working as tutors, mentors, student success coaches, postsecondary transition coaches, and integrated student support coordinators in other support roles. “Our colleges and universities have always been a driving force in solving America’s greatest challenges; and, today, we’re calling on these critical institutions to stand up once again by using Federal Work Study and other dollars to help accelerate learning and recovery in our K-12 schools,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “I applaud the 26 colleges and universities that are leading the way as early adopters of this effort by answering the call and partnering with the National Partnership for Student Success in this work. By serving as tutors and mentors, college students can make a positive difference in the lives of children and youth, and ultimately, it is in the best interests of our colleges and universities to help accelerate academic recovery in our public elementary and secondary schools. I’m hopeful that this initiative will inspire more college students of diverse backgrounds and income levels to consider careers as educators.” The Department’s Dear Colleague Letter calls on colleges and universities that receive FWS dollars to set a goal of using at least 15 percent of their FWS funds for community service within the next two years, and to devote any increase in the use of FWS compensation for community service to employment in P-12 schools or out-of-school time programs as tutors, mentors, student success coaches, and in other NPSS roles supporting students. Colleges and universities may also join this effort by significantly increasing the number of college students placed in these kinds of roles, regardless of if Federal Work Study funds are used. The Dear Colleague Letter also encourages colleges and universities to share data with the NPSS on the number of college students serving in these roles, and highlights how federal funds can account for a larger share of FWS compensation paid for these roles than other FWS roles. Acknowledging the staffing challenges that many schools have faced as they work to mount high-impact tutoring and mentoring programs, the Dear Colleague Letter encourages school and district leaders to partner with regional colleges and universities to establish partnerships that will enable college students to fill these student support roles in schools and out-of-school time programs. In addition, the letter highlights federal resources that schools and districts can use to increase the number of individuals serving in these roles. “Institutions of higher education have an unprecedented opportunity to swiftly address community learning needs and create pathways to service by pairing federal work study with AmeriCorps funding to establish or expand programs that place college students as tutors, mentors, postsecondary transition coaches and other student support roles,” said Michael D. Smith, CEO of AmeriCorps. “AmeriCorps members and their peers in postsecondary institutions, along with our more than 200 higher education partners that manage AmeriCorps programs, can help lay the groundwork for closing this growing gap. We are proud to stand with our colleagues at the U.S. Department of Education, the National Partnership for Student Success, and those institutions that are rising to the challenge to help our country’s students stay on track.” “We know the profound impact of the pandemic on K-12 students in Baltimore. They have lost months and years of academic preparation that will have lingering effects on their economic opportunity in the years to come,” said Ron Daniels, the President of Johns Hopkins University, home of the Everyone Graduates Center. “Through the National Partnership for Student Success, our work-study students will be able to make a measurable and meaningful difference in the lives of future learners while also learning new skills and engaging with our neighbors and communities. This project represents a truly mutually beneficial opportunity for all involved. As the home of the National Partnership for Student Success Support Hub, Johns Hopkins University and the Everyone Graduates Center at our School of Education are thrilled to support not only students in Baltimore through this work, but students in schools and higher education institutions nationwide.” The first cohort of early adopter colleges and universities committed to increasing the number of college students supporting K-12 schools and students includes: AZ - Arizona State University DC - Howard University MD - Johns Hopkins University MD - Montgomery College MI - Grand Valley State University MI - University of Michigan NY - New York University NY - State University of New York (SUNY) System Campuses: Buffalo State, Binghamton, College of Environmental Science and Forestry, Cortland, Old Westbury, Oneonta, Onondaga Community College, Rockland, Tompkins Cortland Community College, Upstate, and University at Albany OH - Rhodes State College TN - University of Memphis TX - Texas A&M University System Campuses: Central Texas and Kingsville VA - Longwood University VA - University of Virginia VA - Virginia Commonwealth University VA - Virginia Tech The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on our students’ learning and mental health and has widened long-standing inequities and opportunity gaps for low-income students, students of color, English learners, and students with disabilities. As a result of President Biden’s historic investment of $130 billion through the American Rescue Plan to safely reopen schools, keep them open, and address the academic and mental health needs of students, schools nationwide are investing in high-impact interventions, such as tutoring and mentoring, afterschool and summer learning programs, and school-based health services. As a result, today, many more students are on the path to recover fully from the pandemic and succeed in school, college, and future careers. Despite this progress, many schools have faced challenges in finding staff to support these critical programs. Today’s announcement supports President Biden’s call for an additional 250,000 Americans to support our schools and youth-serving organizations by serving as tutors and mentors and in other high-impact roles that help address the academic, mental health, and broader impacts of the pandemic on school-aged children. To help meet this goal, the Biden-Harris Administration launched the NPSS in July 2022 at an event at the White House. The NPSS is a research-based, locally-driven public-private partnership between the Department, AmeriCorps, and the Everyone Graduates Center at Johns Hopkins University that helps schools, districts, nonprofits, and State and local governments create, expand, and improve evidence-based programs that support the academic recovery, mental health, and overall well-being of students. It specifically supports increasing the number of tutors, mentors, student success coaches, postsecondary transition coaches, and wraparound/integrated student support coordinators providing research-based supports to students that promote their academic recovery and overall well-being. We encourage additional colleges and universities to sign up to join the Administration’s effort to increase the number of college students serving in these roles, share their goals and progress, and participate in a professional learning community through the NPSS using this link: https://www.partnershipstudentsuccess.org/colleges/ . School districts are encouraged to engage with the NPSS and access support implementing high-quality tutoring, mentoring and other programs, including help attracting volunteers or staff or identifying a college, university, or other partner, using this link: https://www.partnershipstudentsuccess.org/schools-districts/ .

8-May-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-announces-42-billion-approved-public-service-loan-forgiveness-more-615000-borrowers-october-2021,"U.S. Department of Education Announces $42 Billion in Approved Public Service Loan Forgiveness for More Than 615,000 Borrowers Since October 2021","To mark Public Service Recognition Week, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) today announced that, as of the beginning of May 2023, it has approved a total of $42 billion in Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) for more than 615,000 borrowers since October 2021. This is a result of the temporary PSLF changes made by the Biden-Harris Administration that made it easier for borrowers to reach forgiveness. At the end of the previous Administration, only about 7,000 borrowers had been approved for the PSLF program. Additionally, the Department is announcing the implementation of improvements to the PSLF Help Tool, which borrowers use to apply for the program. These updates will, for the first time, let borrowers complete the entire PSLF application process online, and borrowers will no longer need to fax or mail in their application with a wet signature. Allowing borrowers to submit e-signatures for themselves and request e-signatures from their employers will significantly decrease processing time. In addition, borrowers can now digitally track the status of their PSLF form in the My Activity section of their StudentAid.gov account, where they can see updates such as whether their employer has digitally signed their PSLF form and when their form has been processed. This upgrade is in addition to the Biden-Harris Administration's long-term improvements to the PSLF program, slated to take effect in July 2023, which will provide lasting benefits for borrowers. “Since Day One, the Biden-Harris Administration has worked relentlessly to fix a broken student loan system, including by making sure we fulfill the promise of Public Service Loan Forgiveness for those who have spent a decade or more serving our communities and our country,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “To date, the Biden-Harris team has kept that promise for more than 615,000 teachers, nurses, social workers, servicemembers, and other public servants by approving a combined $42 billion in student loan debt forgiveness. The difference that Public Service Loan Forgiveness is making in the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans reminds us why we must continue doing everything we can to fight for borrowers and why families cannot afford to have progress derailed by partisan politicians. During Public Service Recognition Week—and every week—we thank all those who serve our communities.” The targeted debt relief announced today is part of the Department’s ongoing efforts to ensure that the PSLF program fulfills the promise made to Americans who enter public service and that they receive the debt forgiveness they have earned by serving their communities and the country. Public Service Recognition Week celebrates individuals who serve the United States and local communities as an employee of Federal, state, local, or tribal government. PSLF is one of several student loan forgiveness programs established by law. It supports public employees—such as teachers, firefighters, and members of law enforcement, as well as those who work for a non-profit organization in a variety of fields—by forgiving the remaining federal student loan balance for those who work in public service and make the required 120 qualifying monthly payments. Borrowers across the country have benefited from the Department’s efforts to ensure that all public servants can more easily access this targeted debt relief. Of the nearly 616,000 borrowers whose loans have been approved for forgiveness, nearly 610,000 borrowers have already seen their loans discharged, and the rest will soon follow. In addition to the borrowers who have been approved for forgiveness, more than two million borrowers now have an approved PSLF Form and are on the path to forgiveness. More public service employees around the country continue to apply as they become aware of the PSLF Program. Continuously Improving the PSLF Help Tool The Department remains committed to making it easier for borrowers to know if they are eligible for PSLF, certify their employment, apply for forgiveness, and track their progress. For the first time since the program began, borrowers can now sign and submit their PSLF form digitally and track its status throughout the process. “FSA is making the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program as easy as possible so all public servants can finally get the loan forgiveness they have earned,” said Federal Student Aid Chief Operating Officer Richard Cordray. “The improved PSLF Help Tool is another step forward to modernize and simplify the process for people who rely on us to carry out the law effectively.” In the past, borrowers had to take multiple steps to complete and submit their PSLF Form. In most cases, they had to print and sign their form, obtain signatures on the printed form from one or more employers, then submit the completed form and related documents by mail or fax. Now, borrowers can complete the entire process digitally on StudentAid.gov via the PSLF Help Tool. The newly updated PSLF Help Tool enables borrowers to sign and submit their PSLF form digitally; identify employers that need to sign the form and request an e-signature; and track the status of their form. These major changes to the PSLF application process are improving the experience both for public servants and for the employers who need to certify their employment. Long-term Improvements to PSLF Program Through Regulations In October 2022, the Department announced final regulations for the PSLF Program that will deliver lasting improvements for borrowers. These improvements will go into effect July 1, 2023, and are detailed in this fact sheet . The improvements include: helping borrowers earn progress toward PSLF, simplifying criteria to help borrowers certify qualifying employment, and< providing opportunities for borrowers to get help correcting PSLF account problems. Borrowers with Direct Loans who work in public service are also likely to benefit from the one-time account adjustment announced by the Department last year. Borrowers with other types of federal loans have until the end of 2023 to consolidate into the Direct Loan program to receive credit for qualifying payments under this adjustment. In addition to this one-time account adjustment, the Department also announced earlier this year new proposed regulations that would transform income-driven repayment (IDR) plans to better serve borrowers. The regulations would create the most affordable IDR plan that has ever been available to student loan borrowers, allowing those with incomes under $30,500, or under $62,400 in a family of four, to qualify for $0 monthly payments. They will also simplify the program and eliminate common pitfalls that delay borrowers’ progress toward forgiveness. Historic Progress on Targeted Loan Relief The PSLF approvals announced today are part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s broad efforts to support students and provide more than $66 billion in targeted loan relief to nearly 2.2 million borrowers so far, with more on the way. Actions include: Establishing a fair and accessible bankruptcy discharge process to help struggling borrowers discharge their federal student loans. Providing $9.8 billion in relief for 469,000 borrowers who have a total and permanent disability. Approving $13.3 billion in borrower defense claims to nearly 1 million borrowers whose schools were found to have cheated them out of their promised education, including extending full relief to approved claims and approving new types of claims. Providing $1.26 billion in closed school discharges to 107,000 borrowers who attended the now-defunct ITT Technical Institute, which failed to deliver on the promises it made to students. Restoring eligibility for federal student aid to almost 7.5 million borrowers to help them get back on track to complete their credential or degree."
3-May-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/statement-us-secretary-education-miguel-cardona-new-nations-report-card-history-and-civics-education,Statement from U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona on New Nation’s Report Card on History and Civics Education,"U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona issued the following statement on the latest Nation’s Report card showing a decline in history and civics scores for eighth graders: “The latest data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress further affirms the profound impact the pandemic had on student learning in subjects beyond math and reading. It tells us that now is not the time for politicians to try to extract double-digit cuts to education funding, nor is it the time to limit what students learn in U.S. history and civics classes. We need to provide every student with rich opportunities to learn about America’s history and understand the U.S. Constitution and how our system of government works. Banning history books and censoring educators from teaching these important subjects does our students a disservice and will move America in the wrong direction.”"
2-May-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-departments-commerce-labor-and-education-announce-selecttalentusa-new-partnership-increase-quality-jobs-through-fdi,"U.S. Departments of Commerce, Labor, and Education Announce SelectTalentUSA, New Partnership to Increase Quality Jobs through FDI","WASHINGTON – Today, Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona, and Acting Secretary of Labor Julie Su announced the launch of SelectTalentUSA, a joint initiative to help build a pipeline of skilled workers to meet the growing workforce needs of foreign multinationals as they establish new – or expand existing – operations in the United States. The new partnership seeks to help foreign investors build local and state partnerships, adapt their traditional talent-development approaches to the U.S., and harness America’s unique comparative advantage—its diverse and skilled workforce. SelectTalentUSA supports the Departments’ efforts to promote foreign direct investment (FDI) that creates good-paying jobs in America. Encouraging these kinds of investments is an essential part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s work to create an equitable economy for workers and families and revitalize communities that have been overlooked or left behind. The initiative also responds to the challenges that foreign investors face as they enter the United States, by providing information and connections on how to access and leverage the diverse American workforce. “Ensuring we have a well-trained workforce is critical to spurring more foreign direct investment in the U.S.,” said Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo. “By connecting foreign multinationals to federal and local partnerships that train American workers, SelectTalentUSA will help encourage investment in America, create good-paying jobs, and get workers the skills they need to compete and thrive.” ""Promoting student achievement and equipping students with the skills they need to be globally competitive is a core objective of our Raise the Bar: Lead the World initiative,"" said Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""SelectTalentUSA is an opportunity to showcase the outstanding and diverse talent that we have in this country, demonstrate our commitment to preparing the next generation of students to drive innovation in the workforce, and drive home why companies around the world should consider investing in America a smart investment.” “Improving equitable access to good jobs helps to build an economy that works for everyone,” said Acting Secretary of Labor Julie Su. “Leveraging our partnerships through SelectTalentUSA helps foreign investors establish and expand access to a skilled and diverse workforce and underscores our commitment to ensuring the U.S. retains its place among the most productive and innovative economies in the world.” The Departments of Commerce, Labor, and Education will pilot the program this year with the German, Swiss, and Austrian markets, energizing existing cooperation with those countries on expanding apprenticeships. The three Departments have in place a Joint Declaration of Intent with the federal government of Germany and Memoranda of Understanding with Switzerland and Austria—each meant to increase cooperation and exchange of information on the countries’ well-established and highly successful apprenticeship systems. The Departments of Commerce, Labor, and Education along with over 20 other departments comprise the SelectUSA-led Interagency Investment Working Group (IIWG) to increase coordination and provide guidance and information related to specific and broad-reaching issues that affect business investment decisions. SelectTalentUSA will leverage the IIWG to connect foreign investors to the resources and experts to establish quality training and education programs. Registered Apprenticeship is an industry-driven, high-quality career pathway where employers can develop and prepare their future workforce, and individuals can obtain paid work experience with a mentor, classroom instruction and a portable, nationally recognized credential.

""Our 2023 RISE Awardee, Carlene Pacheco, has set a national example for what it means to raise the bar for creating welcoming, inclusive school cultures that help students and families from diverse backgrounds thrive,"" U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona said. ""By working passionately to meet the unique needs of Native American students and to create educational opportunities that honor and uplift tribal Nations, Ms. Pacheco has contributed to rising graduation rates at Churchill County High School and strengthened the fabric of the entire community. I congratulate Ms. Pacheco on this well-deserved recognition and thank her for reminding the nation yet again of the pivotal role that school support staff play in the success of students and families."" Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo said, ""On behalf of our state, I'd like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to Carlene Pacheco for this well-deserved recognition. Carlene's unwavering passion, expertise, and dedication make her a true role model for all education professionals in Nevada and a valuable asset to our education system."" Nevada Superintendent of Public Instruction Jhone Ebert said, ""Carlene Pacheco is known for not only going above and beyond, but anywhere and everywhere her students need her to be. She meets families at their homes, on the soccer field, even the grocery store to make sure her students get the support they need to succeed. This level of dedication and the results she achieves are why she's being honored with this prestigious national award. I am both proud and grateful that she is making such a difference here in Nevada."" This honor, established by Congress in 2019, spotlights classified school employees' outstanding contributions to quality K-12 education in the United States. Classified school employees include paraprofessionals, clerical and administrative services, transportation services, food and nutrition services, custodial and maintenance services, security services, health and student services, technical services, and skilled trades professionals. They offer essential services to the school community and play a vital role in providing for the welfare, safety, and success of students. In addition to her daily duties, Pacheco serves on the Nevada Indian Education Advisory Committee. Its mission is to support, promote, and assure optimum educational opportunity that is based on tribal cultures and maximize participation in the education of American Indians and Alaskan Natives in Nevada. She makes a positive impact on Native American student learning and graduation rates through offering one-on-one tutoring, classroom support, and after-school tutoring. Pacheco exemplifies growing up in a community and being part of a program that reaches the most students. She has built bridges among the community, Native American Reservation, and schools. The community views Pacheco as someone to rely on and come to for assistance. Events leading to her selection began in April 2019 when Congress passed the Recognizing Achievement in Classified School Employees Act (Public Law 116-13), which states, ""Prior to May 31 of each year… the Secretary shall select a classified school employee to receive the Recognizing Inspiring School Employees Award for the year."" For the third annual competition, the Education Department received 29 nominations from 16 states. Each nomination was peer-reviewed, and four finalists were forwarded to the Secretary for consideration. Governors' offices determined their state-specific process for selecting up to two nominees, and they will again be asked to submit nominees by Nov. 1, documenting excellence in the following areas: 1) Work performance; 2) School and community involvement; 3) Leadership and commitment; 4) Local support (from co-workers, school administrators, community members, etc., who speak to the nominee's exemplary work); and 5) Enhancement of classified school employees' image in the community and schools.

25-Apr-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/fact-sheet-house-republican-proposals-hurt-children-students-and-borrowers-and-undermine-education,"FACT SHEET: House Republican Proposals Hurt Children, Students, and Borrowers, and Undermine Education","Congressional Republicans are holding the nation's full faith and credit hostage in an effort to impose devastating cutbacks that would hurt children and undermine education, raise costs for hardworking families, and set back economic growth. And they are demanding these slashes while separately advancing proposals to add over $3 trillion to deficits through tax giveaways skewed to the wealthy and big corporations. While President Biden's plan invests an additional $11 billion to improve education while lowering everyday costs of essentials like child-care for families, House Republicans' proposal to cut a broad range of critical programs by 22% will : Gut Funding for Low-Income Students. The proposal would cut approximately $4 billion in funding for schools serving low-income children, impacting an estimated 26 million students and reducing program funding to its lowest level in almost a decade—a cut equivalent to removing more than 60,000 teachers and specialized instructional support personnel from classrooms. Reduce Support for Students with Disabilities. Under the proposal, as many as 7.5 million children with disabilities would face reduced supports—a cut equivalent to removing more than 48,000 teachers and related services providers from the classroom. Slash Mental Health Support for Students. The House Republican proposal would limit educators' abilities to address student mental health issues and prevent violence, suicide, and drug abuse by cutting Title IV, Part A funding for schools by about $300 million. Make College More Expensive . A 22% budget cut would likely eliminate Pell Grants altogether for 80,000 students while reducing the maximum award by nearly $1,000 for the remaining 6.6 million recipients, making it harder to attend and afford college. Eliminate Student Debt Relief and Borrower Supports. The proposal would cancel the President's student debt relief plan, keeping much needed emergency student loan relief of up to $20,000 for more than 40 million Americans recovering from the effects of the pandemic. It would also block the creation of new, more affordable student loan payment plans.

24-Apr-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-educations-office-federal-student-aid-awards-new-contracts-five-companies-serve-borrowers-reduce-delinquency-and-improve-accountability,"U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Federal Student Aid Awards New Contracts to Five Companies to Serve Borrowers, Reduce Delinquency, and Improve Accountability","Today, the U.S. Department of Education’s (Department’s) office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) announced it has signed contracts with five companies to modernize and enhance loan servicing for more than 37 million borrowers with federally managed loans. Central Research, Inc.; EdFinancial Services; Maximus Education, LLC; Missouri Higher Education Loan Authority (MOHELA); and Nelnet Diversified Solutions received contracts today through the Unified Servicing and Data Solution (USDS) solicitation and will implement much-needed improvements to better serve borrowers. This new loan servicing environment is part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s sweeping efforts to improve the student loan repayment system and help all borrowers successfully manage their debt. These awards are the first step toward implementing the Department’s new servicing environment next year, which will be FSA’s long-term loan servicing solution. The new environment is designed to provide federal student loan borrowers with a high-quality customer experience and to deliver support for at-risk borrowers so that all borrowers can take advantage of the most affordable ways to repay their loans, avoid default, and claim loan forgiveness, if they are eligible for it. Vendor accountability is a central goal of the new servicing contracts, which provide rewards for better customer outcomes and impose consequences for failing to meet expectations. For example, servicers that keep vulnerable borrowers current on their payments will receive a financial performance incentive, and FSA will allocate new accounts to servicers that have proven they are able to keep borrowers current. Likewise, servicers that provide unsatisfactory or untimely service will face financial disincentives. “The Biden-Harris Administration is fixing broken programs like Public Service Loan Forgiveness and writing the most affordable repayment plan ever, and the Department of Education is working tirelessly to implement these policies and maximize benefits for borrowers,” said Under Secretary James Kvaal. “The contracts awarded today will combine more investment and more accountability to deliver higher levels of service to 37 million borrowers with federally managed loans, help them claim student loan benefits they have earned, and reduce the number of borrowers who fall into delinquency and default.” Since day one, the Biden-Harris Administration has taken a comprehensive approach to fixing the broken student loan system and increasing college affordability for every student. Under President Biden and Vice President Harris, the Department has completely revitalized targeted debt relief programs like Public Service Loan Forgiveness, Borrower Defense, and Total and Permanent Disability Discharge, approving $55 billion in discharges for more than two million borrowers to date. Additionally, the Department continues to implement and enforce strong consumer protections for higher education in America to ensure bad actors are held accountable for cheating students and leaving them with unaffordable debts, and it continues to propose new investments in Pell Grants and other scholarships to reduce borrowing before students step foot on a college campus. “Building on efforts to overhaul loan servicing dating back to 2014, FSA is finally delivering on the promise to borrowers. These contracts focus on robust accountability and quality control mechanisms to make sure borrowers get the help and support they deserve,” said FSA Chief Operating Officer Richard Cordray. “FSA will work with the servicers to develop the necessary infrastructure, training, and procedures so we can implement the new loan servicing environment in 2024.” Ultimately, the new loan servicing environment will provide all federally managed student loan borrowers with complete account management capabilities on StudentAid.gov; reduce disruptions from account transfers; and increase servicer accountability through clear, service-level metrics. Because of the scope of this work, FSA will take a phased approach to implementing the new environment. The long-term contracts awarded today will make major improvements when they go live in 2024. These include updated cybersecurity provisions and compliance with consumer protection rules as well as improved customer experience through a single sign-on using a borrower’s FSA ID, which will make it easy to navigate between servicer websites and StudentAid.gov. Over the five years of the base contract, FSA will continue to expand functionality on StudentAid.gov with the goal of transitioning full account management, branding, and repayment away from servicer websites. The contracts awarded under the USDS solicitation will replace the legacy servicing contracts for Direct Loans and federally managed Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program loans to drive improved borrower outcomes, especially for vulnerable borrowers. To maintain stability as the new loan servicing environment gets underway, FSA will extend the legacy servicer contracts through December 2024, as Congress has authorized, which will help facilitate a smooth transition for borrowers. Awarding the contracts for the new loan servicing environment is the culmination of nearly a decade of work to overhaul federal student loan servicing. Over the past five years, the Department has laid the groundwork for the new environment to deliver a high-quality customer experience through FSA’s Next Gen initiative. This initiative had its first major launch in December 2019 by consolidating multiple websites for students, parents, and borrowers into StudentAid.gov. Since then, FSA has launched and enhanced many of its resources, including the Aidan® virtual assistant, Loan Simulator, the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Help Tool, and more, which help borrowers more easily navigate different parts of the student aid journey, from managing their federal student loans to applying for the PSLF Program. FSA awarded the Business Process Operations (BPO) contracts to support customers and partners across all FSA programs and operations via contact centers and manual processing. Through the new servicing environment, FSA is leveraging these investments to deliver the next generation of loan servicing. The President’s Budget seeks $2.7 billion for Student Aid Administration, including to FSA, a $620 million increase over the fiscal year 2023 enacted level. This additional funding is essential to support students and student loan borrowers. The increase would allow FSA to continue to operate the student aid programs, implement critical improvements to student loan servicing, continue to modernize its digital infrastructure, and ensure successful administration of the financial aid programs through a simplified and streamlined application process for students and borrowers. More information about how the new loan servicing environment will provide federal student loan borrowers with a 21st-century customer experience, hold servicers to a high level of performance, and enable the Department to focus on impactful objectives like reducing delinquency and default can be found here ."

Across the country, 26 schools, 11 districts, and four postsecondary institutions are being honored for their innovative efforts to reduce environmental impact and utility costs, improve health and wellness, and ensure effective sustainability education. The honorees were named from a pool of candidates nominated by 18 states. Notably, two-thirds of this year’s honorees are located in disadvantaged communities. In addition, one state education official is recognized with the Director’s Award. This year, it is Alexandria Roe of the University of Wisconsin System. The challenges posed both by the pandemic and by climate change have driven home the importance of modernizing school facilities, embracing sustainability, prioritizing health and wellness, and improving learning conditions for students, especially in underserved communities, said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. Our 2023 U.S. Department of Education Green Ribbon Schools have raised the bar for sustainable practices, energy efficiency, health and wellness, and hands-on learning experiences that enhance students problem-solving skills and foster a sense of environmental stewardship and civic responsibility. I want to congratulate the educators, school leaders, students, families, and advocates engaged in this work for showing the nation that any school in any community can strive to be a green school, and in doing so, empower the next generation to build a healthier, more equitable, and more sustainable nation.” The list of all selected schools, districts, colleges, and universities, as well as their nomination packages, can be found here .

More information on the federal recognition award is here . Resources for all schools to move toward the three Pillars can be found here . In related infrastructure and sustainability news, in the recent omnibus appropriations bill, the Department was authorized funding to administer two programs related to school infrastructure that will address sustainable schools practices. These are: 1) a state capacity building program that will bolster several of the lowest capacity states in school facilities to, in turn, support their highest-need school districts; and 2) a national technical assistance center for school infrastructure that will support high-need districts across the nation. In both of these programs, healthy, safe, sustainable, 21st century school facilities and grounds that support high quality learning will be guiding tenants. In addition, the Department is engaging the non- and for-profit private sectors by leading an infrastructure and sustainability challenge , encouraging partners to make commitments to supporting healthy, sustainable, equitable school infrastructure, environmental education, and bold environmental justice and climate goals in schools that the Department will then promote in order to inspire additional commitments.

19-Apr-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/statement-secretary-cardona-speaker-mccarthys-debt-ceiling-proposal,Statement from Secretary Cardona on Speaker McCarthy’s Debt Ceiling Proposal,"Today, U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona issued the following statement after Speaker Kevin McCarthy released a proposal that would cancel the Biden-Harris Administration’s targeted, one-time debt relief program: “Today, Speaker McCarthy declared that he will force a catastrophic default and plunge America into recession unless he can claw back school relief dollars and prevent millions of hardworking Americans – including over 83,000 borrowers in his own district – from getting the student debt relief they need coming out of the pandemic. It's a shame for students and working families across the country that Republican lawmakers, many of whom benefitted from hundreds of thousands of dollars in small business loan forgiveness, continue to fight hypocritically to deny critical student debt relief to millions of their own constituents. While President Biden, Vice President Harris, and I continue working to deliver much-needed relief to borrowers working to get back on their feet after the pandemic, Speaker McCarthy’s proposal tells us everything we need to know about what he and his allies value—tax cuts for the super rich, special interests, and big corporations over support for hardworking Americans.” Overall, more than 40 million borrowers would qualify for the Biden Administration’s debt relief program. Nearly 90 percent of the benefits of the relief going to out-of-school borrowers would go to those earning less than $75,000 per year. Additional information: In Kevin McCarthy’s district, 83,400 borrowers are eligible for student debt relief, 49,800 borrowers applied or were automatically eligible for relief, and 31,600 borrowers were fully approved for debt relief before special interests sued to block the debt relief program from moving forward. See additional congressional district data here . Rep. Kevin Hern had $1,082,302 in his own Paycheck Protection Program (PPP)loans forgiven. He represents 112,400 borrowers eligible for student debt relief. Rep. Matt Gaetz had $482,321 in his own PPP loans forgiven. He represents 75,000 borrowers eligible for student debt relief. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene had $183,504 in her own PPP loans forgiven. She represents 91,800 borrowers eligible for student debt relief. Rep. Vern Buchanan had $2,353,167 in his own PPP loans forgiven. He represents 95,400 borrowers eligible for student debt relief. Rep. Brett Guthrie had $4,416,574 in his own PPP loans forgiven. He represents 90,800 borrowers eligible for student debt relief."
11-Apr-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/federal-student-aid-denies-florida-career-college-application-continue-offering-federal-grants-loans-and-work-study-funds,"Federal Student Aid Denies Florida Career College Application to Continue Offering Federal Grants, Loans, and Work-Study Funds","Following a thorough investigation, the U.S. Department of Education’s office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) informed Florida Career College (FCC) today that its application to continue to participate in the federal student aid programs has been denied. FCC’s application was denied based upon evidence demonstrating: Violations of the ability-to-benefit (ATB) regulations, which govern when a student who does not have a high school diploma or its equivalent can receive federal student aid; Failure to meet the fiduciary standard of conduct; and Failure to meet the standards of participation, including the standards of administrative capability. FCC has the option to allow students who are currently receiving federal student aid to continue their educational programs until the fall. FSA is taking this step to minimize disruptions to the education of current students and allow those who so choose to complete their programs if possible. “Federal Student Aid is holding Florida Career College accountable for taking advantage of some of the most vulnerable students,” said FSA Chief Operating Officer Richard Cordray. “Despite the school’s actions, they have an opportunity to do right by some of these students.” In July 2022, FSA placed FCC on Heightened Cash Monitoring 2 (HCM2), which provides additional oversight to safeguard taxpayer dollars, based on its initial investigative findings. In October 2022, FSA notified FCC of issues uncovered in the investigation and gave the school an opportunity to respond. FCC’s provisional participation in the federal student aid programs expired on Sept. 30, 2022. FSA then authorized FCC’s participation on a month-to-month basis while the school’s recertification application was pending as is required by higher education regulations. Violations of the ATB regulations A student who has neither a high school diploma nor its recognized equivalent may be eligible to receive federal student aid by passing an approved ATB test. The purpose of the ATB test is to determine whether a student who does not have a high school diploma can benefit from postsecondary education. Among other things, this protects students from ending up with debt they cannot afford. Students who pass the test can access federal student aid to pursue postsecondary education. The ATB regulations establish criteria to ensure, among other things, that an ATB test is administered independently from the school the student seeks to attend. During its investigation, FSA found that proctors administering ATB tests for FCC routinely broke the rules governing test administration, including by filling in or changing answers after students finished their tests, helping students during testing or taking tests for them, and permitting students to use calculators in violation of testing rules. FSA also found that FCC employees and employees of its parent company, International Education Corporation (IEC), knew about and encouraged violations of the ATB testing process to affect test outcomes. For example, FCC and IEC senior leaders tracked proctor pass rates and sought to replace proctors with low pass rates, and they picked the supposedly “independent” proctors they wanted to administer ATB tests at FCC campuses. FCC and IEC officials also pressured proctors to pass students and otherwise inappropriately inserted themselves into ATB test administration and proctor training in order to increase passage rates and subsequent enrollments. FCC enrolled a significant portion of its students through the ATB testing process. Since 2018, between 43% and 48% of FCC students enrolled at the school through ATB testing. Furthermore, FCC and another school owned by IEC accounted for nearly 75% of all ATB enrollments nationwide during the 2021-22 award year. FCC’s pervasive violations of the rules and regulations governing the ATB testing process harmed students. In ATB testing, it is equally important to identify applicants who do not have the ability to benefit from academic training as it is to identify those who do. From 2016 to 2021, more than 50% of ATB students withdrew from FCC without completing their 10-month certificate program. Additionally, from award year 2018–19 through award year 2021–22, more than 80% of ATB students who withdrew from FCC still incurred debt or exhausted their Federal Pell Grant eligibility or both. Failure to meet the fiduciary standard of conduct Schools and the owners of the schools that participate in the federal student aid programs must adhere to a fiduciary standard of conduct and must act with the competency and integrity required as a fiduciary. FSA found substantial evidence that FCC leadership engaged in longstanding and systematic manipulation of ATB testing to ensure that pass rates would maximize ATB enrollments. This misconduct extended to the highest levels of FCC and its parent company, IEC. Proper administration of the ATB program enhances educational opportunities for vulnerable students who seek postsecondary education and training despite their lack of a high school diploma. FCC’s efforts to maximize enrollment without regard for a student’s true ability to benefit imposed serious harms on many of its students. It also harmed taxpayers, who are often left on the hook when students are unable to benefit from their programs and repay their loans. This misconduct demonstrated a lack of integrity inconsistent with the expectations of a fiduciary. Failure to meet the standards of participation, including the standards of administrative capability To participate in the federal student aid programs, schools sign a Program Participation Agreement and, in doing so, agree to adhere to all applicable statutory and regulatory provisions and to competently administer the programs with adequate internal controls. Evidence shows that FCC knew or should have known about potential problems with its administration of ATB testing at least as early as May 2020, yet the school appeared not to conduct meaningful internal audits and compliance monitoring of ATB testing. This, among other factors, demonstrates that FCC lacks adequate checks and balances in its system of internal controls, as required by regulation. FCC’s failure to adhere to the statutory and regulatory provisions applicable to ATB testing also establishes that FCC failed to administer the programs competently or in accordance with all statutory and regulatory provisions. Protecting Students As of late 2022, FCC enrolled nearly 5,000 students in short-term programs according to data the school provided to its accreditor. If FCC agrees to minimize disruptions to students, those currently enrolled and receiving federal student aid can maintain their aid to continue their educational programs at FCC, if the students so choose, through Sept. 30, 2023. This would allow most, if not all, of FCC’s students to obtain sufficient federal student aid to pay for the entirety of the tuition charges to complete their programs. FSA will not allow FCC to enroll any new students using federal student aid during this time. Additional conditions FCC must meet to maintain access to federal aid programs until Sept. 30 include detailed monthly reporting to the Department; an updated teach-out plan and reporting on teach-out agreements with other area schools; continued participation under HCM2 status; a letter of credit; and clear communication with students about their status and education options. If FCC opts to not accept FSA’s conditions for continued federal grant and loan funding for current students, FSA will end the school’s participation in the federal student aid programs effective April 30, 2023. FCC must notify FSA whether it will continue participation with these conditions no later than April 18, 2023. FCC also can seek reconsideration of the recertification denial by submitting evidence to dispute FSA’s findings by April 25, 2023. If any such evidence is submitted, FSA will evaluate it and notify the school about whether the denial of its reinstatement application will be modified, rescinded, or remain in place. FSA will communicate directly with FCC students to explain today’s decision and post information online at StudentAid.gov/floridacareer . FSA will continue to communicate as next steps and options become clear. The goal is to equip FCC students with the information needed to make a well-informed decision about next steps and their educational futures. FSA is also poised to collaborate with state partners and the school’s accrediting agency to support students as FCC exits the federal student aid program. That work will include helping students understand their options to enroll at another school or apply for loan discharge, such as a false certification discharge if they were wrongfully enrolled through ATB testing. Today’s actions reflect FSA’s commitment to support the needs of America’s students and borrowers and hold postsecondary schools accountable for misconduct."
6-Apr-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/fact-sheet-us-department-educations-proposed-change-its-title-ix-regulations-students-eligibility-athletic-teams,FACT SHEET: U.S. Department of Education's Proposed Change to its Title IX Regulations on Students' Eligibility for Athletic Teams,"Since Title IX was signed into law more than 50 years ago, it has enabled tremendous strides in educational opportunity free from sex discrimination, including in athletics, for millions of students across the country. Today, the U.S. Department of Education is releasing a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) on athletic eligibility under Title IX to advance Title IX's longstanding goal of ensuring equal opportunity in athletics. During the two years of outreach to stakeholders to develop this proposed rule, the Department heard repeatedly that many schools, students, parents, and coaches face uncertainty about when and how transgender students can participate in school sports, particularly because some states have chosen to adopt new laws and policies on athletics participation that target transgender students. The NPRM, if adopted as a final rule, would provide much needed clarity for students, parents, and coaches. Participation in school athletics is an important component of education and provides valuable physical, social, academic, and mental health benefits to students. The proposed rule affirms that students benefit from the chance to join a school sports team to learn about teamwork, leadership, and physical fitness. The proposed rule would establish that policies violate Title IX when they categorically ban transgender students from participating on sports teams consistent with their gender identity just because of who they are. The proposed rule also recognizes that in some instances, particularly in competitive high school and college athletic environments, some schools may adopt policies that limit transgender students' participation. The proposed rule would provide schools with a framework for developing eligibility criteria that protects students from being denied equal athletic opportunity, while giving schools the flexibility to develop their own participation policies. ""Every student should be able to have the full experience of attending school in America, including participating in athletics, free from discrimination. Being on a sports team is an important part of the school experience for students of all ages,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""Beyond all the benefits to physical and mental health, playing on a team teaches students how to work hard, get along with others, believe in themselves, and build healthy habits that last a lifetime. Today's proposed rule is designed to support Title IX's protection for equal athletics opportunity. We welcome and encourage public comment on the proposed regulation and will continue working to ensure Title IX's effective protection for all students."" The Department invites and encourages public comment. The public comment period will be for 30 days from the date of the NPRM's publication in the Federal Register . Summary of the proposed rule: The proposed rule would apply to public K-12 schools, as well as colleges, universities, and other institutions that receive federal funding (referred to here as ""schools""). The proposed rule builds upon the longstanding Title IX rules that protect equal athletic opportunities for women and girls. Since 1975, federal regulations have required that schools provide equal athletic opportunities for students regardless of sex. In February 2023, the Department released new resources for students, parents, coaches, and school communities to help them assess whether their athletic programs are fulfilling Title IX's promise to women and girls. Those resources help families assess whether women's and girls' teams receive equivalent levels of coaching, facilities access, fields and equipment, and financial assistance as the men's and boys' teams. For example, if a high school provides the boys' baseball team with a high-qualify turf field, but requires the girls' softball team to play on a poorly maintained grass field without fencing or lighting, the school may be violating Title IX. Nothing in today's proposed rule would change these longstanding requirements that women and girls be afforded equal athletic opportunity, and the proposed rule affirms that schools can offer separate men's and boys' and women's and girls' sports teams in certain circumstances. The proposed regulation supports Title IX's nondiscrimination requirement, while providing flexibility for schools to achieve important educational objectives through their athletic program. Title IX's nondiscrimination requirement serves to ensure that all students have equal opportunity to enjoy the benefits of team sports participation. Participating in school athletics is an important component of education and provides valuable physical, social, academic, and mental health benefits to students. Younger students, in particular, benefit from the chance to join a team and learn about teamwork, leadership, and physical fitness. Under the proposed regulation, schools would not be permitted to adopt or apply a one-size-fits-all policy that categorically bans transgender students from participating on teams consistent with their gender identity. Instead, the Department's approach would allow schools flexibility to develop team eligibility criteria that serve important educational objectives, such as ensuring fairness in competition or preventing sports-related injury. These criteria would have to account for the sport, level of competition, and grade or education level to which they apply. These criteria could not be premised on disapproval of transgender students or a desire to harm a particular student. The criteria also would have to minimize harms to students whose opportunity to participate on a male or female team consistent with their gender identity would be limited or denied. The proposed regulation would recognize that differences in grade and education level, level of competition, and sports must be taken into account for any eligibility criteria that would restrict transgender students from participating on teams consistent with their gender identity. One-size-fits-all policies that categorically ban transgender students from participating in athletics consistent with their gender identity across all sports, age groups, and levels of competition would not satisfy the proposed regulation. Such bans fail to account for differences among students across grade and education levels. They also fail to account for different levels of competition—including no-cut teams that let all students participate—and different types of sports. Taking those considerations into account, the Department expects that, under its proposed regulation, elementary school students would generally be able to participate on school sports teams consistent with their gender identity and that it would be particularly difficult for a school to justify excluding students immediately following elementary school from participating consistent with their gender identity. For older students, especially at the high school and college level, the Department expects that sex-related criteria that limit participation of some transgender students may be permitted, in some cases, when they enable the school to achieve an important educational objective, such as fairness in competition, and meet the proposed regulation's other requirements. Schools would have to take into account the following considerations when developing a policy for participation: The proposed regulation recognizes that there are differences among students and school sports teams depending on grade and education level. Students in different grades and education levels have different levels of athletic skill, and schools offer sports teams for different reasons depending on students' grade or education level. For example, teams for younger students often focus on building teamwork, fitness, and basic skills for students who are just learning about the sport, while a collegiate team may be primarily focused on competitive success. That's one reason why the Department expects that, under its proposed regulation, elementary school students would generally be able to participate on school sports teams consistent with their gender identity where considerations may be different for competitive high school and college teams. Especially for students in earlier grades, including for example those in elementary school, school athletic teams focus on introducing students to new activities and prioritize team sports as an opportunity for students to learn basic skills in physical fitness, leadership, and teamwork. The proposed regulation would recognize that school athletic teams vary in the level of competition they offer. School teams vary widely across the United States, with some that are very competitive, especially for high school and college students with advanced skills, and others, such as ""no cut"" teams, that allow all students to join and participate. Some schools also offer teams at lower levels of competition, such as intramural or junior varsity teams, that allow all or most interested students to participate. Sex-related eligibility criteria that restrict students from participating consistent with their gender identity would have to reflect these differences in competition. The proposed regulation would recognize that the types of sports offered vary widely and that sport governing bodies vary in their participation criteria. Sports vary widely in the skills they require, and students vary widely in their talent for particular sports. Recognizing this, the Department proposes that schools that seek to restrict students from participating consistent with their gender identity must take account of the nature of the sports to which the restriction would apply. The Department's proposed approach fits with Congress's direction in 1974 that the Title IX regulations include reasonable provisions that ""consider[] the nature of particular sports."" (Education Amendments of 1974, Pub. L. No. 93-380, § 844, 88 Stat. 484, 612 (1974)). Many sport governing bodies have created participation criteria for their sports, and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) recently adopted a sport-specific approach for eligibility criteria for male and female teams in its college-level competitive leagues. The proposed regulation would recognize the importance of minimizing harms to students whose participation on teams consistent with their gender identity would be limited or denied. Preventing students from participating on a sports team consistent with their gender identity can stigmatize and isolate them, and those students may not be able to participate at all if the only other option is to participate on a team that does not align with their gender identity. This is different from the experience of a student who is not selected for a team based on their skills. If a school could achieve its important educational objective by using sex-related criteria that would cause less harm but the school chooses not to minimize the harm, the school might not satisfy the proposed regulation, depending on the specific facts involved. *** The current Title IX athletics regulation can be found at 34 C.F.R. § 106.41. The proposed regulation would be added as (b)(2), and current (b) would be redesignated as (b)(1). The proposed regulation's text: The proposed regulation would be in the Title IX regulations at section 106.41(b)(2): If a recipient adopts or applies sex-related criteria that would limit or deny a student's eligibility to participate on a male or female team consistent with their gender identity, such criteria must, for each sport, level of competition, and grade or education level: (i) be substantially related to the achievement of an important educational objective, and (ii) minimize harms to students whose opportunity to participate on a male or female team consistent with their gender identity would be limited or denied. Background on Title IX's Guarantee of Equal Opportunity in Athletics : The Title IX regulations, since they were first issued, have made clear that different treatment on the basis of sex is generally prohibited, recognizing that such treatment can cause harm by limiting educational opportunities because of sex-based stereotypes about individuals' talents, capacities, and preferences. Congress also indicated, however, that the athletics context presents special considerations and that the Title IX regulations should include ""reasonable"" provisions governing athletics in light of ""the nature of particular sports."" Education Amendments of 1974 § 844. The Department's regulations have thus long permitted schools to offer separate male and female teams in some circumstances while also requiring schools to provide equal opportunity based on sex in their overall athletic program. Courts have affirmed that Title IX allows schools flexibility to organize their athletic program as they wish so long as they provide equal athletic opportunity. For example, a school that offers a golf team for girls but not boys might be permitted under Title IX to exclude a boy from the girls' golf team so long as the school provides boys with equal opportunity based on sex in its athletic program as a whole. Similarly, if a school offers a golf team for boys but not girls, it might be permitted to exclude a girl from the boys' golf team if girls have equal opportunity to participate in the school's overall athletic program. Background on the Department's Process for Developing the Proposed Regulation : In 2021, President Biden directed the Department in both Executive Order 13988 on Preventing and Combating Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity or Sexual Orientation and Executive Order 14021 on Guaranteeing an Educational Environment Free from Discrimination on the Basis of Sex, Including Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity to review its current regulations to ensure they fully implement Title IX's protection against sex discrimination. In its review process, the Department received extensive public feedback, including in a nationwide public hearing convened by its Office for Civil Rights (OCR), during which OCR received over 280 live comments and over 30,000 written comments, along with listening sessions and meetings. The Department considered comments from stakeholders expressing a variety of views, including student-athletes, parents, athletic associations, professional athletes, teachers, faculty members, school staff and administrators, and other members of the public. The Department heard that students, parents, schools, athletic associations, and others need clarity about how schools can meet Title IX's nondiscrimination requirement if they limit students' eligibility to participate on male or female athletic teams consistent with their gender identity. In developing the proposed regulation, the Department also reviewed Title IX's text and purpose, courts' interpretations of Title IX and the U.S. Constitution, and the approaches to athletic eligibility criteria currently taken by a wide range of States, school districts, athletic associations, and sport governing bodies. Information about the public comment period: The Department's proposed Title IX regulation will be open for public comment for 30 days from the date of publication in the Federal Register .

OCR identified concerns over the university’s response to complaints it received of antisemitic harassment. First, the university’s Affirmative Action and Equal Opportunity (AAEO) Office declined to investigate any of the complaints, even though they notified the university regarding serious allegations of harassment. Second, responsive steps the university did take were delayed; were not designed to rectify concerns communicated to the university, including regarding the existence of a hostile environment; and may have discouraged students and staff from raising further concerns with the university or with participating in the OCR investigation. “I am grateful for the University of Vermont’s commitment to address antisemitic harassment that violates federal civil rights law,” said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon. “Everyone has a right to learn in an environment free from antisemitic harassment. We will be watching to be sure these students are safe.” The complaints about which the university received notice, but did not investigate through its AAEO Office, included allegations that a teaching assistant posted on social media about not giving Jewish students course participation credit; subtracting points for Jewish students, including because “I hate ur vibe in general”; celebrating the theft of an Israeli flag from a Jewish student’s residence; and adding the word, ""Kristallnacht,"" above a picture of a damaged storefront with accompanying Hebrew text. They also included allegations that student groups excluded Jewish students, that students threw rocks at the building housing Hillel and student dormitory space, and that when a student living in the building asked them to stop, one of the students responded, “Are you Jewish?” To ensure full satisfaction of its obligations under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its implementing regulations, the university entered into a resolution agreement committing it to: Review and revise its policies and procedures to include a description of forms of discrimination that can manifest in the university environment, and to ensure that the university’s response to notice of discrimination including national origin harassment on the basis of shared ancestry is consistent with Title VI. Develop a protocol clarifying the roles and responsibilities of the AAEO Office and Bias Response Team to monitor implementation of the protocol by the provost; Train university staff responsible for investigation of Title VI complaints. Train university senior leadership, all other staff, and students on the Title VI prohibition against harassment based on national origin, including shared ancestry, in the university’s programs and activities. Issue a statement with a commitment to address discrimination based on shared ancestry, including antisemitism, within 30 days of the signing of the agreement and again with its annual antidiscrimination statement. Review the university’s 2022 Climate Survey results to determine if other actions, beyond those memorialized in the agreement, are needed to improve the campus climate. And, Submit to OCR during the monitoring of the agreement copies of case files of complaints of antisemitism filed during the preceding academic year. The letter to the University of Vermont is available here and the resolution agreement is available here ."

Five parents and four students, participated in the event. Joining Deputy Secretary Marten from the Department were Assistant Secretary for Office of Planning, Evaluation, and Policy Development Roberto Rodriguez and Assistant Secretary for Office for Civil Rights Catherine Lhamon. At the top of the meeting, U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona, through video remarks, stated plainly to the children, “We in the Biden-Harris Administration see you and we support you.” In the meeting, the Deputy Secretary reaffirmed the administration’s support for transgender students and their right to be free to learn as themselves stating, “Feeling safe is a bottom line -- they need to feel supported and seen.” Assistant Secretary Lhamon followed up by telling the students and their parents, “Federal law is in place to protect your rights. That is the mission of our office [the Office for Civil Rights].” When telling their stories, some students described facing bullying, misgendering, forced outing, and hateful comments from peers, teachers, and administrators. A few mentioned testifying and speaking against discriminating laws in their states. The parents in the room shared their experience as well, all of them stating that they just want their children to live a life free from the trauma of hatred and discrimination. Some mentioned filing complaints with school officials, meeting with leaders, and contemplating moving out of the country in order to make sure their children have a more quality experience in and out of the classroom. Both the students and their parents spoke directly to the reason they need to speak on their experiences in public spaces. They want to be supportive to their peers that may be experiencing the same situations but have no one to turn to. In response to what the students and their parents shared Assistant Secretary Rodriguez stated, “We have your back and are so impressed that you have your friends’ backs, testifying for them and supporting them.”"

We know many transgender, non-binary, and gender non-conforming students face challenges that can impact their mental health and their ability to thrive in school—not because of who they are, but because of the hostility directed at them. “Unfortunately, this hostility is what follows when politicians are among those attempting to bully transgender students and their families, and use state laws to limit who they can be in our school communities. It’s unacceptable. It goes against what we stand for as a nation. Schools must be welcoming, affirming, and nurturing places for teaching and learning. The Department of Education will continue working together with parents and families, educators, and students so that we can achieve this goal for every young person.”"

It’s a shame for these borrowers—the overwhelming majority of whom make less than $75,000 a year—and their families that their representatives are working so hard to deny them critical relief. Instead of working to support hardworking students and borrowers, Republicans in Congress would rather give trillions of dollars in tax breaks to the super wealthy and the biggest corporations. The Biden-Harris Administration will continue to fight to deliver much-needed support to borrowers trying to get back on their feet after the economic crisis caused by the pandemic.”"

This letter reinforces the Department of Education's (Department's) position that corporal punishment in schools should be replaced with evidence-based practices, such as implementing multi-tiered systems of support like Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports, that create a safe and healthy school environments. Every student and educator should feel safe and supported inside of school buildings; and more importantly, schools should always be free from the threat of violence. ""It's unacceptable that corporal punishment remains legally permissible in at least 23 states. Our children urgently need their schools to raise the bar for supporting their mental health and wellbeing,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""Despite years of research linking corporal punishment to poorer psychological, behavioral, and academic outcomes, tens of thousands of children and youth are subjected to beating and hitting or other forms of physical harm in school every academic year, with students of color and students with disabilities disproportionately affected. Schools should be places where students and educators interact in positive, nurturing ways that foster students' growth and development, dignity, and sense of belonging—not places that condone violence and instill fear and mistrust."" Despite decades of research showing the short and long-term harms of corporal punishment, the practice continues to be legal in at least 23 states. In addition, the Department released guiding principles on how to maintain safe, inclusive, supportive, and fair learning environments for students and school staff, including specific recommendations for evidence-based practices to give students what they need to learn and grow. The Department stands ready to support efforts to replace harmful disciplinary practices, including exclusionary discipline and corporal punishment. Through the historic funding under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 and the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act , and additional laws like the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, the Department can support these evidence-based practices consistent with program requirements. The Department will also continue to support schools in their efforts to move away from the use of exclusionary and physical punishment through its technical assistance centers, including the Best Practices Clearinghouse , National Center on Safe Supportive Learning Environments , and National Center to Improve Social and Emotional Learning and School Safety , among other resources. These actions today show a continued commitment by the Biden-Harris Administration to Raise the Bar in education, advance equity, and support the well-being, safety and success of all students. The letter builds upon the Department's position from a similar action in 2016 under the direction of then Secretary John King Jr. and 2014 under the direction of Secretary Arne Duncan in the Obama-Biden Administration."

The Department’s regulatory efforts reflect our commitment to supporting students and ensuring they can access opportunities that will help them succeed. “The Department’s primary responsibility is to serve students and help them succeed,” said Education Secretary Miguel Cardona. “That means we must continue to take a look at a range of regulations to ensure that colleges and programs serve our students well and that Department processes work in their best interest.” Today’s announcement is the first step in the process of issuing new regulations. Following the public hearings, the Department will finalize the issues to be addressed through rulemaking and solicit nominations for non-federal negotiators who can serve on the negotiated rulemaking committee(s), which will convene in fall 2023. The Department suggests the following topics for regulation in the hearing notice but invites comment on any regulatory issue that can improve outcomes for students. Potential topics may include: The Secretary’s recognition of accrediting agencies and related issues Institutional eligibility, including State authorization Third-party servicers and related issues The definition of distance education as it pertains to clock hour programs and reporting students who enroll primarily online Return of Title IV funds Cash management to address disbursement of student funds Federal TRIO programs We also invite public input on how the Department could, through its Title IV regulations, help improve borrowers’ understanding of repayment options and ensure borrowers select an income-driven repayment plan—instead of enrolling in deferment or forbearance—if doing so would be in their best interest. The virtual public hearings will be held from April 11-13 from 10 a.m. to noon and 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. Eastern Time. Individuals who would like to make comments at the public hearings must register by sending an email message to negreghearing@ed.gov no later than noon Eastern Time on the business day prior to the public hearing at which they wish to speak.

14-Mar-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/education-department-announces-use-secret-shopping-protect-students-crack-down-institutions-lure-students-lies%E2%80%AF%E2%80%AF,"Education Department Announces Use of Secret Shopping to Protect Students, Crack Down on Institutions that Lure Students with Lies","The U.S. Department of Education (Department) announced today that the Enforcement Office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) will use secret shoppers as an additional tool to monitor postsecondary institutions’ compliance with the laws and regulations governing their participation in the federal student aid programs. In particular, secret shoppers will evaluate recruitment, enrollment, financial aid, and other practices of postsecondary institutions to help identify potentially deceptive or predatory practices used to recruit and enroll students. “Secret shopping is another tool in FSA’s toolbox as we expand our oversight work to hold predatory schools accountable,” said FSA Chief Operating Officer Richard Cordray. “Our focus—as always—is to ensure that students, borrowers, families, and taxpayers are not being preyed upon to make a quick buck.” Specifically, secret shoppers will look for misrepresentations regarding the transferability of credits, job placement rates, completion and withdrawal rates, graduates’ future earning potential, career services, the cost of attendance, the amount of federal student aid, and accreditation status, along with any other practices that may violate the laws and regulations governing an institution’s participation in the federal student aid programs. Findings from secret shopping may serve as evidence to support an ongoing investigation or review, or provide a basis for opening a new investigation or review. Where appropriate and permitted, FSA will refer findings from its secret shopping efforts to other Department offices, including the Office of Inspector General, and share findings with other law enforcement partners at the state and federal levels. “Schools that engage in fraud or misconduct are on notice that we may be listening, and they should clean up accordingly,” said Kristen Donoghue, FSA’s chief enforcement officer. “But schools that treat current and prospective students fairly and act lawfully have nothing to fear from secret shopping.” Improving Student Outcomes by Bolstering School Oversight This work represents some of the latest progress on the Biden-Harris Administration’s ongoing commitment to improving student outcomes, including by holding low-performing and predatory schools accountable for swindling students out of time and money and leaving taxpayers holding the bill. In October 2021, the Department reinvigorated school oversight and accountability efforts within FSA by reestablishing an Enforcement Office and hiring a chief enforcement officer, who reports directly to FSA’s chief operating officer. That has already paid dividends. For example, in fiscal year 2022, FSA: Initiated dozens of actions, including denying 10 school recertifications; revoking six Provisional Program Participation Agreements, which enable schools to participate in the Title IV program; and issuing two terminations, five suspensions, seven debarments, and eighteen fines totaling $2.5 million; Opened new investigations into fraud and deceptive practices at multiple schools and completed related site visits; Strengthened its relationships with state and federal partners, including the Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Department of Veterans Affairs, and state attorneys general, to identify and take action against schools that do not put their students’ interests first; Released guidance outlining how it will implement long-standing provisions in the Higher Education Act that grant the Secretary authority to require leaders of private colleges that fail to operate in a financially responsible way to assume personal liability for the cost of unpaid debts owed to the Department of Education; and Approved group discharges based on borrower defense findings, providing approximately $11.4 billion in relief to 875,000 students who attended Corinthian Colleges, Inc., ITT Tech, Marinello Schools of Beauty, and Westwood College. In addition to today’s secret shopper bulletin, FSA issued two other enforcement bulletins to bolster school compliance and better communicate with outside stakeholders. The first bulletin warned schools that the Department will act aggressively when it finds misrepresentations made to servicemembers and veterans by schools. FSA’s chief enforcement officer also wrote about the Department’s commitment to protecting military-connected students . The second bulletin announced a new avenue for knowledgeable sources to submit tips about potential violations of the laws and regulations governing the federal student aid programs. FSA conducts oversight to protect students who receive federal student loans, grants, and work-study funds to attend postsecondary schools. FSA’s oversight also ensures the quality of educational programs and safeguards the interests of taxpayers through audits, investigations, and program reviews, among other oversight actions."

Advances President Biden's call to expand free community college across the nation and includes $500 million for a new discretionary grant program that provide up to two years of free postsecondary education through high-quality community college programs that lead to good paying jobs or four-year degrees. Advances strategies to improve postsecondary attainment, degree completion and student success through increased funding for the Postsecondary Student Success Grants, $30 million to support the systems development to enable students to access non-student aid public benefits, and a new proposal to create a Postsecondary Education Advancement Technical Assistant Center. Enhances institutional capacity at HBCUs, TCCUs, MSIs, and low-resourced institutions, including community colleges, by providing an increase of $429 million over the FY 2023 enacted level. Makes significant investments in Federal Student Aid, providing $2.7 billion in essential support to student loan borrowers as they return to repayment, critical improvements to student loan servicing, and ensures the successful administration of its financial aid programs. The request provides a $620 million increase over the FY 2023 enacted level. Building on the President's strong record of fiscal responsibility, the Budget more than fully pays for its investments—reducing deficits by nearly $3 trillion over the next decade by asking the wealthy and big corporations to pay their fair share.

This is the first time the Department has launched a challenge to advance the education technology space for adult learners. These finalists will receive $50,000 to support the development of their prototype and will participate in a virtual accelerator – six months of intensive technical assistance to further develop their products. One grand-prize winner will receive $500,000, and up to two runners-up will receive a share of at least $250,000, to be announced in fall 2023. The Future Finder Challenge brings collaboration and innovation into the adult education environment through education technology. This challenge supports the Secretary's ""Raise the Bar: Lead the World"" priority to ensure that every student has a pathway to college and career. ""Career navigation tools have become vital to success in today's workforce. Yet too few of these tools are designed to support the needs of adult learners,"" said Assistant Secretary of the Office of Career, Technical, and Adult Education Amy Loyd. ""We are thrilled to see such high-quality submissions as we work to increase equitable access to quality careers."" The challenge received 76 submissions in response to OCTAE's invitation to build digital career navigation tools that better support adult learners. Entrant teams — including minority, women, veteran, LGBTQ+, and Native American-owned organizations from 29 states — submitted prototypes ranging from skills assessment and career matching to mentor access and job application tools. To evaluate submissions against the Stage 1 criteria , the challenge brought together multidisciplinary panels of reviewers and judges with expertise in adult education, edtech, career navigation, industry, and inclusion and accessibility. BestFit , a minority & women-owned business (St. Louis, Missouri) - A mobile-optimized web platform that recommends available resources, empowering adult learners to design their own support networks. The platform matches learners to on-campus, community, federal, and philanthropic resources such as childcare, healthcare, transportation, meals, and financial assistance. Gladeo , a minority & women-owned business (Los Angeles, California) - A regional career navigation platform that combines a virtual career day with a program finder, a self-assessment quiz, and personalized news about resources and opportunities, helping adult learners identify and pursue pathways into careers of interest. Territorium , a minority owned-business (San Antonio, Texas) - A mobile application that matches adult learners' knowledge, experience, and interests with current hiring needs, building a workforce pipeline that benefits employers and employees alike. The app supports learners through the entire career navigation process, including exploration, training, and application. Wingspans , a women-owned business (Providence, Rhode Island) - A web platform that provides adult learners with access to more than 700 career stories and employer profiles. Users can learn from others with similar backgrounds to identify pathways into quality careers. Workbay , a women-owned business (Franklin, Tennessee) - A web, mobile, and offline platform — deployed across national, state, regional, and correctional programs — that links career exploration, skill-building, job postings, and applicant tracking. The six-month Stage 2 virtual accelerator will commence with an in-person boot camp. These five finalists will then have access to virtual resources, webinars, and mentorship from subject matter experts across topics such as adult education, design research, product design, storytelling, and growth and sustainability. At the end of the accelerator, finalists will submit their market-ready tools and accompanying proposals, and present at a live demo day in fall 2023. A judging panel will review the submissions against the Stage 2 criteria and recommend a slate of winners to the Department. Beyond Stage 2, the challenge will support winners into 2024 as they deploy their solutions. To help promote further innovation, challenge resources and videos will remain available to all entrants as well as to those who did not participate in the challenge. Innovators are encouraged to continue using these resources to develop new digital tools that reimagine career navigation for adult learners.

6-Mar-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-education-secretary-issues-statement-passing-disability-rights-leader-judy-heumann,U.S. Education Secretary Issues Statement on Passing of Disability Rights Leader Judy Heumann,"Today, U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona issued the following statement on the passing of Disability Rights Leader Judy Heumann: “On March 4, our country lost a great disability rights leader with the passing of Judith (Judy) Heumann . As Assistant Secretary for the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services during the Clinton Administration, Judy helped ensure that students with disabilities not only had the right to physically attend public school, but that such students had the right to learn the same curriculum as their non-disabled peers. Her leadership is realized in the nearly 20 percentage point jump from 2000 to 2023 in the number of students with disabilities who graduate with a standard high school diploma. Judy’s legacy also includes influencing the publication of the regulations implementing Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 that bars discrimination against disabled people in federally funded programs. “Judy Heumann’s devotion to public education for all students was second to none. After she had polio as a toddler, her parents had to fight to enroll her in public school. When she graduated from college, she had to sue the New York Board of Education to validate that using a wheelchair did not prohibit a person from being a qualified teacher. One of her last speaking engagements was on Martin Luther King Jr. Day to a group of middle and high school students on the connection between the disability rights movement and the civil rights movement. “Judy was always an educator, always a trailblazer, always a leader. We send our deepest condolences to her husband, Jorge Pineda; her brothers, Ricky and Joseph; and her extended family. Her memory will forever be a blessing.”"
2-Mar-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/education-department-takes-steps-hold-leaders-risky-colleges-personally-liable,Education Department Takes Steps to Hold Leaders of Risky Colleges Personally Liable,"Guidance clarifies implementation of long-standing statutory provisions Today, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) released guidance outlining how it will implement long-standing provisions in the Higher Education Act that grant the Secretary authority to require leaders of private colleges that fail to operate in a financially responsible way to assume personal liability for the cost of unpaid debts owed to the Department of Education. The guidance clarifies the circumstances in which the Department may require certain individuals to assume personal liability as a condition of allowing the schools they own or operate to participate in the federal financial aid programs and details the considerations that the Department will take into account when determining whether to require an individual to assume personal liability by signing the institution’s program participation agreement. The Department would then be able to pursue those individuals for the cost of liabilities that are not otherwise paid for by their institutions, including those stemming from closed school and borrower defense discharges. “The Biden-Harris Administration is canceling the loans of more than a million borrowers cheated by for-profit colleges. But too often, the owners and executives of these colleges escape liability,” said Under Secretary James Kvaal. “Congress gave the Department the authority to make college owners and operators personally responsible for these losses in certain circumstances and we are going to use that authority to hold them accountable, defend vulnerable students, protect taxpayer dollars, and deter future risky behavior.” “Individuals who control schools and reap substantial profits are responsible for running healthy institutions,” said Federal Student Aid Chief Operating Officer Richard Cordray. “When financially risky schools jeopardize the safety of the government's Title IV funds and take advantage of students, we intend to hold those individuals accountable.” This guidance clarifies how the Department will implement Section 498(e) of the Higher Education Act (HEA), which specifies that the Department may require individuals who exert significant control at private institutions to assume personal liability. However, prior to this guidance, the Department did not have a practice – even for the riskiest colleges — of requiring individuals to assume personal liability, challenging its ability to hold them responsible for unpaid liabilities. The Department anticipates it is most likely to require an individual to assume personal liability on behalf of the institutions or groups of affiliated institutions that pose the largest financial risk to the United States, including institutions that annually receive tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars of Title IV funds and institutions with the most serious and significant sets of concerns related to their compliance with federal financial aid rules. By focusing on the riskiest institutions and the individuals with the ability to make significant decisions regarding the operation of their institutions, the Department will not only be protecting students and borrowers, but also fulfilling Congress’ statutory direction that the Department protect the financial interests of the United States. To guide the Department’s decision-making, the guidance includes a non-exhaustive list of factors the Department may consider when determining whether to pursue personal liability. These include: Civil or criminal lawsuits, settlements, or disciplinary or legal actions by the Department or other state or federal agencies involving federal student aid or claims of dishonesty, fraud, misrepresentation, consumer harm, or financial malfeasance. Significant compliance issues, such as findings stemming from program reviews or audits, unpaid liabilities from either of those processes, or findings of a lack of administrative capability. An executive compensation or a bonus structure that could significantly affect the financial health of the institution. The Department will consider these factors when assessing institutions that have demonstrated certain statutory indicators of financial risk, such as significant audit findings, or failing to meet financial responsibility requirements. Going forward, the Department will generally begin making determinations on a case-by-case basis about whether it will require individuals to assume personal liability when their institution’s program participation agreement is up for renewal or if they undergo a change in ownership. There also may be instances in which the Department accepts other financial protections to minimize the risk of financial losses in lieu of the signature."
28-Feb-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/secretary-cardona-statement-following-supreme-court-oral-arguments,Secretary Cardona Statement Following Supreme Court Oral Arguments,"Today, U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona issued the following statement after the conclusion of oral arguments before the Supreme Court on the Department’s one-time student debt relief program: “Today, the Biden-Harris Administration mounted a powerful defense before the U.S. Supreme Court on our plan to provide targeted, one-time student debt relief to more than 40 million working- and middle-class Americans as they recover from the pandemic. The Department of Justice argued against the lawsuits aimed at denying relief to borrowers, made clear that challengers to the program lack standing to even bring their cases to court, and explained the Department of Education’s decades-old authority used by multiple administrations to protect borrowers from the effects of national emergencies. “President Biden, Vice President Harris, and I recognize how essential this relief is for tens of millions of Americans, and we are fighting to deliver much-needed help to borrowers trying to get back on their feet after the economic crisis caused by the pandemic. “In addition to this one-time debt relief plan focused on the effects of the pandemic, we will continue to put the needs of students and borrowers ahead of special interests, hold colleges accountable for runaway costs and unaffordable debts, and pursue historic changes to student loan repayment that will cut costs and reduce the crushing burden of student debt for millions of working families.”"
16-Feb-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-announces-more-188-million-bipartisan-safer-communities-act-support-mental-health-and-student-wellness,U.S. Department of Education Announces More Than $188 Million from the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act to Support Mental Health and Student Wellness,"Today, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) is announcing awards of more than $188 million across 170 grantees in over 30 states to increase access to school-based mental health services and to strengthen the pipeline of mental health professionals in high-needs districts. With funding provided by the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA), these investments help advance the President’s Mental Health Strategy, which directly implements his Unity Agenda priority to tackle the mental health crisis in our school communities. These grants will enable communities to hire approximately 5,400 school-based mental health professionals and train an estimated 5,500 more to build a diverse pipeline of mental health providers in schools. These investments will begin the important work of broadening access to critical mental health supports by increasing the number of health care providers in schools. These funds also will help with strengthening the pipeline of certified mental health providers who are ready to work in schools with the greatest needs. These competitive grants are the first in a series of awards the Department will make over several years and constitute the largest investment in school-based mental health this country has ever made. Even before the pandemic, the wellbeing of many students was unmet due to insufficient access to high-quality mental health care. For years, schools have struggled to meet the recommended ratios for school-based mental health professionals, and this is especially true in schools with more underserved students. Now, the mental health crisis facing students has reached a critical point with more than one in three high school students reported experiencing poor mental health during the height of the pandemic. Research shows that children and young people learn more, report feeling safer, and develop more trusting relationships with their peers and teachers when their social and emotional needs are met with certified and accessible mental health professionals. “As the President outlined in his State of the Union address, we must do more to tackle our nation’s growing mental health crisis, which is particularly acute among our youth,” said Domestic Policy Advisor to the President Susan Rice. “These new awards will help connect more students in need to school-based mental health services now and ensure a pipeline of trained professionals to support students in the future. Integrating mental health services into our schools is a key component of the President’s Mental Health Strategy and will help fulfill a key component of the President’s Unity Agenda.” “Even before the disruption, isolation, and trauma of the pandemic, youth rates of anxiety and depression, and other mental health challenges were on the rise, and too many students suffered in silence,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “Mental health and wellness have profound implications for our students, their academic success, and their overall outcomes, and we know that youth facing mental health challenges are more likely to receive services in a school-based setting. The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act represents an unprecedented opportunity to raise the bar for our support of our students, to improve learning conditions in our schools, to expand access to school-based mental health care, and to supercharge efforts across the country to train and hire a pipeline of professionals committed to the wellbeing of our students.” These historic awards are made possible because of funds secured as part of the 2022 Omnibus and BSCA. Over the next five years, BSCA will invest $1 billion in these programs, helping us to make substantial progress towards the President’s goal, as part of his Mental Health Strategy , to double the number of school counselors, social workers, and other mental health professionals. These funds have the potential to meaningfully change lives by building a mental health infrastructure in schools and communities across the country. “Following countless conversations with Connecticut parents, educators, and district leaders, as Chair of the subcommittee that funds the Department of Education, I created the School-Based Mental Health Services Grant Program to help districts increase the number of qualified, well-trained mental health professionals working in schools,” said Ranking Member of the House Appropriations Committee Rosa DeLauro . “Disruption in schools due to COVID-19, economic anxiety, job losses, and learning challenges have exacerbated pre-existing mental health challenges. Our youth need help, and this is a burden that teachers, administrators, and parents cannot alleviate on their own. These grants will expand the program’s reach, helping to move us closer to my goal of ensuring every child goes to a school that has a qualified mental health professional on staff. I want to thank Secretary Cardona for spearheading efforts to get this funding to our schools and improve the health care of our children.” As part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s ongoing efforts to tackle our mental health crisis by working to ensure every student has access to the mental health supports, the U.S. Department of Education will host a town hall, in partnership with the Department of Health and Human Services, to hear directly from students and young people about the importance of social, emotional, and mental health. The townhall will take place at John Lewis High School in Fairfax County, Virginia where the district has received a grant to make critical investments to recruit, develop, and retain highly qualified and credentialed school-based mental health professionals, including counselors, social workers, and psychologists. Fairfax County Public Schools is part of a larger cohort of Virginia grantees. This year, Virginia’s districts and institutions of higher education are receiving more than $10 million in funds to strengthen the pipeline and provide school-based mental health services to the state’s underserved students. This investment will support the mental health and academic trajectories of students across the state. These grantees include Campbell County Public Schools, Lynchburg City Schools, Fairfax County Public Schools, Newport News Public Schools, the University of Virginia, and the partnership between Portsmouth Public School Board and Norfolk State University. Awards are being announced for two grant programs today: the School-Based Mental Health Services (SBMH) Grant Program and the Mental Health Service Professional (MHSP) Demonstration Grant Program. Through SBMH, the Department is investing more than $141 million to 103 states and school districts to increase the number of qualified mental health services providers delivering school-based mental health services to students. These funds increase the number of school psychologists, counselors, and other mental health professionals serving our students through recruitment and retention efforts, the promotion of re-specialization and professional retraining of existing mental health providers, and through efforts to increase the diversity and cultural and linguistic competency of school-based mental health services providers. These investments will allow more students in school buildings across the country to access mental health supports through trained professionals they can trust, and without shame or stigma. Through MHSP, the Department is investing more than $46 million in competitive grants to 67 states, school districts, and institutions of higher education to support and demonstrate innovative partnerships to train school-based mental health services providers for employment in schools and local educational agencies (LEAs). The goal of this program is to increase the number and diversity of high-quality, trained providers available to address the shortages of mental health services professionals in schools and high-needs LEAs. Nearly half of the awardees included a partnership with a Historically Black College or University, Tribal College, or Minority Serving Institution. These funds will help the many schools struggling to fill mental health professional vacancies by creating partnerships between high-needs school districts and institutions.

Just recently, the Department announced the Stronger Connections Grant program, which are awards totaling nearly $1 billion to 56 states and territories through BSCA to help schools in high-needs districts provide students with safe and supportive learning opportunities and environments that are critical for their success. At the beginning of the school year, the Department, along with the U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, sent a letter to governors across the country to highlight federal resources available to states and schools to invest in mental health services for students. The Department also awarded $122 billion in American Rescue Plan Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief funds to help schools reopen and recover, and experts indicate more than $2 billion has been directed to hire more school psychologists, counselors, and other mental health professionals in K-12 schools. With the help of these funds, as of July, compared with the pre-pandemic period, the number of school social workers is up 54%, and the number of school counselors is up 22%."
15-Feb-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-announces-first-ever-augustus-f-hawkins-centers-excellence-program-grants-strengthen-teachers-color-pipeline-and-address-teacher-shortage,U.S. Department of Education Announces First-Ever Augustus F. Hawkins Centers of Excellence Program Grants to Strengthen Teachers of Color Pipeline and Address Teacher Shortage,"Today, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) announced first-ever awards, totaling over $18 million, for the Augustus F. Hawkins Centers of Excellence Program grants to increase high-quality teacher preparation programs for teachers of color, strengthen the diversity of our teacher pipeline, and address teacher shortages. The Augustus F. Hawkins Centers of Excellence Program (Hawkins Program), named for Augustus F. Hawkins, the first Black politician elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from west of the Mississippi River, supports comprehensive, high-quality teacher preparation programs at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Tribally Controlled Colleges and Universities (TCCUs), and Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs). A priority in President Biden’s FY 22 budget proposal, this year marks the first time the Hawkins Program has received funding since its creation in 2008. From the FY 2022 appropriation for the Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education, Congress allocated $8 million for the Hawkins program. The Department is also using funds appropriated for the Hawkins Program in FY 2023 to bring the total for these grants to over $18 million. “Thanks to President Biden’s leadership, I’m incredibly proud to announce the first-ever Hawkins Centers of Excellence Program grants, which will help Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribally Controlled Colleges and Universities, and Minority-Serving Institutions recruit and prepare a new generation of diverse and talented individuals into the teaching profession,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “Today, more than half of our learners nationwide are students of color, and yet fewer than 1 in 5 educators come from communities of color. I’ll never forget the impact that my first teacher of color had on me as a student, and my experience tracks closely with years of research suggesting the profound, positive influence that educators of color have on students of all backgrounds."" Recently, Secretary Cardona laid out his vision to promote academic excellence, improve learning conditions, and prepare our students for a world where global engagement is critical to our nation’s standing. A key focus in his “Raise the Bar” agenda is to boldly strengthen the teacher pipeline to eliminate the educator shortage for every school. Across the country, school districts – particularly in underserved communities– are working to address longstanding educator shortages which have been exacerbated by the pandemic. As of October 2022, 27 percent of public schools had multiple teaching vacancies . These shortages were particularly acute for schools in high-poverty neighborhoods and schools with large portions of students of color where more than half of schools had multiple teaching vacancies (57 percent and 60 percent, respectively). The Hawkins Program builds on the Department’s efforts to strengthen and diversify the teacher pipeline, especially as states and districts work to meet their staffing needs. HBCUs, TCCUs, and MSIs are uniquely positioned to recruit, prepare, and place teachers who will provide culturally and linguistically responsive teaching in underserved schools. Grantees were selected based on their focus on key aspects of a high-quality teacher preparation pipeline, including evidence-based, comprehensive teacher preparation that emphasize classroom experience and mentorship. Today’s teacher workforce does not reflect the demographics of the nation’s public school students. More than 50% of public school students are students of color, yet in 2017-18, the most recent year of available data , roughly 25% of teachers were teachers of color. And while English learners (ELs) are the fastest growing public school student demographic, comprising more than 10% of America’s enrollment, most states face a shortage of bilingual and multilingual teachers prepared and certified for language instruction or to teach ELs. These roles are critical for ensuring Americans can compete in the increasingly globalized economy, guaranteeing equal access to education opportunity for ELs, and creating a strong economy in which all Americans can thrive. Through their applications, all 12 grantees met a competitive priority by proposing projects designed to increase the number of well-prepared teachers from diverse backgrounds, as well as bilingual and multilingual teachers with full certification. The Hawkins Program awardees are listed below: Grantee State Award Project Summary California State University Dominguez Hills CA $1,599,946 Increase number of teachers of color credentialed through teacher training and bilingual programs, and increase wraparound supports to improve completion and retention of future educators. Metropolitan State University CO $1,571,926 Increase completion rates of traditionally underrepresented students by providing comprehensive support for current and prospective students. Florida International University FL $1,565,498 Create four teacher preparation tracks, including a cohort of paraprofessionals already in partnering districts, two cohorts of English speakers, two cohorts bilingual Spanish/English speakers, and two cohorts of bilingual Haitian Creole/English. The program will reduce the barriers that typically affect enrollment in teacher preparation programs, including paid teaching experiences, test preparation, and dedicated advising.

The Department is looking to hear from the public about how an exception contained in the guidance has affected the growth of online enrollment and associated federal student loan debt. ""Online education has the potential to meet the needs of many students and lower costs,"" said Under Secretary James Kvaal. ""But we are concerned about the growth in loan debt and want to ensure students get value for their money. These listening sessions are part of the Department's commitment to undertake a careful, fair, and thorough review of the rules around how contractors recruit students for online programs. This process will give the public a chance to make its thoughts known on any possible changes."" The Higher Education Act prohibits institutions of higher education from providing a commission or bonuses to individuals or entities based on securing enrollment or financial aid. This prohibition is known as the ban on incentive compensation. In 2011, the Department issued guidance related to the ban, which created an exception for third parties if they provide a bundled set of services, which can include recruitment. Since issuing the guidance, the number of students recruited by entities operating under this exception has increased, particularly through online programs operated by third-party entities, including Online Program Managers (OPMs). Given the growth in online enrollment and associated federal student debt, the Department is seeking public input to understand the impact of this exception and whether any updates are necessary to the guidance. The Department is interested in comments from a wide range of stakeholders including institutions, faculty, OPMs and other contractors, advocates, researchers, borrowers, and students on the benefits and disadvantages of the exception for bundled services, how the guidance has impacted institutions and students, and how the Department can better ensure compliance with the prohibition on incentive compensation. The listening session notice includes additional questions for stakeholders to address. A draft version of the listening session notice can be found here . The Department will also accept written feedback from the public on these questions through March 16, 2023 (Docket ID ED-2023-OPE-0030). The virtual listening sessions will be held from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. (EST) on March 8 and 9. Individuals who would like to present comments of up to three minutes must register by sending an email to margo.schroeder@ed.gov no later than 12 p.m. (EST) on the business day prior to the listening session at which they want to speak. The message should include the name of the speaker, the email address of the speaker, and one or more dates and times during which the individual would be available to speak. Individuals who want to observe the listening sessions are also required to register for each day in which they wish to observe. Updated third-party servicer guidance Today, the Department also released updated guidance that clarifies when organizations that contract with institutions are considered regulated entities known as third-party servicers. In particular, the guidance clarifies when companies and others who provide recruitment services for colleges will fall into this category. The updated guidance will ensure the Department has full transparency into and more data on the companies that work with colleges in areas that relate to federal financial aid. It also ensures that the Department and auditors will have the ability to review these companies' compliance with federal rules and regulations. Institutions will have until May 1, 2023, to report any arrangements with third-party servicers that have not been reported to the Department, detail the services the entity performs on behalf of the institution, and disclose the timeframe of the agreement. Entities or individuals that meet the definition of a third-party servicer as a result of this Dear Colleague Letter are required to submit the Third-Party Servicer Data Form to the Department or update their existing form by May 1, 2023. Any audits required of third-party servicers would not be needed for at least six months, with most servicers having significantly longer than that. At the same time, the Department will accept public comment on the guidance through the Regulations.gov website for 30 days (Docket ID ED-2022-OPE-0103). We will consider those comments and publish any relevant changes based upon that feedback at a later date."

The Learning Series, which will launch Feb. 28, 2023, is intended to help education leaders and practitioners implement family engagement strategies that support student success. The series will provide attendees with evidence-based strategies and research, bright spots in the field, and information on resources. “We cannot raise the bar for our students’ academic recovery and achievement without consistent and meaningful engagement with the parents and families who know them best,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “Research tells us that engaging families helps overcome obstacles to learning and that students are more apt to succeed in school when those closest to them are deeply involved. This new learning series is about equipping educators, school and district leaders, and community partners with the most promising models for deepening relationships with parents and students, and highlighting how districts can use the American Rescue Plan’s historic $130 billion investment in education in support of these efforts.” As part of the ongoing support for family engagement, the Department has invested nearly $100 million since 2018 to support family engagement efforts through Statewide Family Engagement Centers. These centers provide technical assistance and training to state educational agencies and local educational agencies in the implementation and enhancement of systemic and effective family engagement policies, programs, and activities. Carnegie Corporation and Overdeck Family Foundation both have a history of making investments to support practitioners and community-based organizations partnering to implement family engagement strategies that support student success and achievement. Partnerships between schools and families have long been recognized as beneficial for children, helping increase children’s attendance and academic achievement. “When families are empowered as true partners in their children’s education, students thrive, schools are stronger, and the whole community benefits—but too often, family engagement is seen as disconnected from teaching and learning,” said Ambika Kapur, program director of public understanding at Carnegie Corporation of New York. “When done well, family engagement can meaningfully boost achievement, support socio-emotional development, and foster inclusive school cultures. As we recover from the pandemic, it is essential that we put family engagement at the heart of school practices. We are delighted to partner with Overdeck Family Foundation and the U.S. Department of Education to make family engagement the priority it deserves to be.” “Engaging families effectively and equitably is not easy, especially when educators and parents are already stretched thin. But it’s a critical component to improving student learning,” said Stephanie Sharp, portfolio manager at Overdeck Family Foundation. “We’re excited to partner with Carnegie Corporation of New York and the U.S. Department of Education to highlight organizations and leaders who are finding innovative and impactful ways to use family engagement to drive student success.” The first virtual session will focus on how family engagement can support math and literacy. Subsequent sessions will take place over the next six months on the fourth Tuesday of the month. These sessions will bring together district, state, and community level family engagement leaders to increase awareness around research and strategies focused on: Attendance and student engagement; Immigrant and multilingual families; Student mental health and well-being; Kindergarten readiness; and College readiness. Register for the second webinar - How Family Engagement Can Improve Student Engagement and Attendance, Tue, Mar 28, 2023 at 1:00 PM ."

Over that period, nearly 6 million community college students received direct financial aid, along with more than 450,000 students at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), more than 24,000 students at Tribally Controlled Colleges and Universities (TCCUs), and nearly 8 million students at Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs), such as Hispanic Serving Institutions. The new data shows that these funds helped millions of students remain in school, kept costs down so students could stay enrolled, and helped keep faculty and staff employed. The Department also released a detailed report today showing that in 2021 alone, 12.7 million students received direct financial aid grants from HEERF funds, which served as a critical lifeline to these students. According to the report, ninety-four percent of community colleges said HEERF allowed them to keep students enrolled who were at risk of dropping out by providing financial support in 2021. “Today’s report makes clear that, for millions of college students, the financial lifelines delivered by President Biden through the American Rescue Plan’s Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund are what made it possible to stay enrolled and on track during the pandemic,” U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona said. “The positive impact of the Biden-Harris Administration’s investments cannot be overstated, especially for students from the communities hit hardest by the pandemic, including our communities of color and low-income urban and rural communities. As I travel the country, I’ve been heartened to hear from students on how the American Rescue Plan helped them stay enrolled and from colleges and universities who said American Rescue Plan funds have helped raise the bar in how they support students, from forgiving debts, to addressing food and housing insecurity, to expanding mental health supports, and so much more.” Institutions of higher education (institutions) are required to submit annual reports to the Department detailing how HEERF has been used to support their institutions, students and communities. The Department used that data and 2022 spending to estimate the overall impact of HEERF funds during the Biden Administration. According to Department estimates, more than 18 million students have received direct financial aid under HEERF since the start of 2021. The Department used the 2021 annual report data to identify key findings and state-specific impact data from the HEERF program. In 2021 alone, HEERF funds: Helped students afford basic needs and remain enrolled in school. In 2021, institutions distributed $19.5 billion in Emergency Financial Aid Grants to 12.7 million students, including 80 percent of Pell Grant recipients . Approximately 9 in 10 institutions reported that HEERF enabled them to keep students enrolled who were at risk of dropping out due to pandemic-related factors. Kept student costs down, including reducing unpaid balances owed to the institution. Roughly 3 out of 4 institutions indicated that HEERF enabled them to keep student net prices similar to pre-pandemic levels. More than 1,400 institutions spent nearly $1.5 billion on discharging unpaid student balances. Kept colleges open and faculty and staff employed. More than 2 in 3 institutions indicated that HEERF allowed them to keep faculty, staff, employees, and contractors at full salary levels. Helped slow the spread of the pandemic. Nearly 3 in 4 institutions stated that HEERF enabled them to purchase COVID tests, provide health screenings, and provide the healthcare necessary to help support students, faculty, and staff. The Department remains committed to providing support, resources, and guidance to institutions, students, and communities. The 2021 Annual Report illustrates how HEERF grants provided institutions and students the necessary resources to navigate responding to and recovering from the pandemic.

OCR’s investigation confirmed that the student notified the university of her pregnancy before the start of the fall 2020 semester and reflected repeated instances in which the student experienced negative consequences stemming from a lack of accommodations for her pregnancy. For example, when the student became unable to fit into a classroom desk due to her pregnancy, she requested a table for one of her classes, but never received one. She also was penalized in a class for poor attendance and received a failing grade in another class because she was denied the ability to make up work. OCR’s investigation identified concerns that: The university did not make reasonable and responsive adjustments responsive to the student’s pregnancy-related requests. Those responses the university did offer to the student’s requests were ad hoc and uncoordinated. The Title IX coordinator did not consistently or timely intervene when the student alerted him to issues with certain classes. No evidence reflected that the Title IX coordinator responded to a professor who sought guidance in addressing the student’s requests. And, The absence of available information about how to obtain pregnancy-related adjustments contributed to the university’s uncoordinated response and left the student to make multiple requests through both the university’s Title IX coordinator and individual professors. To resolve the investigation, the university’s commitments include the following: Providing the student adjustments to grades negatively impacted by the university’s handling of her requests, as well as reimbursement for documented expenses related to courses she has had to retake since the semester when she was pregnant. Reviewing and, where necessary, revising or drafting policies and procedures on how to address requests for adjustments from pregnant students to ensure that it complies with Title IX. Updating its website to provide information such as the Title IX rights of pregnant students, the process for requesting adjustments, and a link to the grievance procedures that apply to complaints of pregnancy-related or other sex discrimination. Faculty and staff training regarding the Title IX rights of pregnant students and the university’s obligations regarding pregnant students, as well as a survey to gauge the effectiveness of the training. And, Tracking of students’ requests for pregnancy-related adjustments and the university’s responses to the requests. “I thank Troy University for addressing the pregnancy-related needs of the student who came to OCR for help and for ensuring that, going forward, it will provide pregnant students equal access to the university’s courses and other offerings,” said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon. The letter to Troy University is available here and the resolution agreement is available here ."
26-Jan-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/secretary-cardona-speaks-native-american-parents-about-unique-needs-native-american-students-urban-oklahoma-schools,Secretary Cardona Speaks with Native American Parents About Unique Needs of Native American Students in Urban Oklahoma Schools,"Yesterday, U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona joined a roundtable with Native American parents in the Oklahoma City area to listen to their unique experiences in urban schools and learn more about ways the Department can support Native American students regarding language preservation and revitalization. Following the release of Secretary Cardona’s Raise the Bar: Lead the World initiative for academic excellence and pathways to global leadership, Secretary Cardona stressed that authentic family engagement is critical to achieve those priorities. ""You are experts of your children. You have a very unique perspective. I’ve visited four Indian Nations. What an eye-opening experience it has been for me to learn the passion around ensuring cultural norms and language are still embedded in the next generation,” said Secretary Cardona. “You are your child’s best and most influential teachers. We as educators play their secondary role.” During the roundtable, parents spoke candidly about the needs of their students, and the need to both encourage language preservation and revitalization and cultural learning while also offering additional mental health support that is culturally sensitive. “We are losing our native speakers. I recently attended an Indian education summit. It was said we had 130 speakers prior to COVID, but now that’s down to 40. We are in a terrible race against time for language preservation and while we are all sitting around going how are we going to fix it, we are losing it. We don’t have time,” said parent Courtny Yarholar, sharing the importance of language preservation. ""Every school should have a social worker; they are very much needed. We need more mental health support in our community. In our native community, we’ve had a lot of loss. The numbers of family members lost; our kids have lost so many loved ones. The hurt is real, and I am burdened by how much loss we have,” said parent Lucyann Harjo, who emphasized the need for more mental health supports for students. Secretary Cardona ended the session by saying, “You are saying what parents are feeling across the country. To this day, people are saying schools shouldn’t be dealing with mental health. Say that to a grieving mother. We owe it to our students to do better, to take advantage of the disruption of pandemic and make sure we aren’t building out schools to how they were in 2018. There is more money in education than ever before. How we use it will determine how successful our students are.”"
24-Jan-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/secretary-cardona-announces-us-department-educations-%E2%80%9Craise-bar-lead-world%E2%80%9D-initiative,Secretary Cardona Announces the U.S. Department of Education’s “Raise the Bar: Lead the World” Initiative,"In a major address, U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona laid out his vision for the direction the agency will follow in 2023 to promote academic excellence, improve learning conditions, and prepare our students for a world where global engagement is critical to our nation’s standing. In his address Secretary Cardona remarked that “Raise the Bar: Lead the World” is not a list of new priorities, but a call to strengthen our will to transform education for the better, building on approaches that we know work in education. Secretary Cardona outlined how the nation has moved forward but emphasized it will take everyone working together to produce lasting change in the pursuit to ensure our nation's schools, students, and teachers have everything they need to be successful. As a way to encourage his vision, U.S. Deputy Secretary of Education Cindy Marten will kick-off her national “Raise the Bar: Lead the World” tour by traveling to Mesa, Arizona, to meet with students, parents, teachers and community members to discuss ways schools can promote academic excellence and prepare for global competitiveness. “Education opens doors. As a student, as a teacher, school principal, and as a parent, I’ve seen firsthand the way it transforms lives. That’s why, when we talk about the future of education, I could not believe more strongly that we have to Raise the Bar,” said Secretary Cardona. “We have what it takes to lead the world in education, but it will take the collective will to challenge complacency and status quo in education and focus on substance, not sensationalism. Working together, I know we can do it.” During his remarks, Secretary Cardona underscored the need for “Raise the Bar: Lead the World” to be a bipartisan effort. The passing of the American Rescue Plan (ARP) provided $130 billion in funding for states to reopen schools following the COVID-19 pandemic and began the work of providing resources aimed at closing long standing academic achievement gaps. Following the passing of ARP, the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act provided funds for the Department’s Stronger Connections Grant which allocated more than $1 billion for providing schools with community centered mental health support. Secretary Cardona laid out in his remarks that this is the moment to move forward even further in ensuring that P12 education provides excellent results for every student no matter their background. After his speech, Secretary Cardona sat down with National PTA Executive Director Nathan Monell to discuss the focus areas in further detail. “National PTA recognizes that rigorous education and support of students must be a priority to invest in the future of our nation,” said Nathan R. Monell, CAE, executive director of National PTA. “Every child has the potential to achieve at high standards and excel as global citizens if they have the opportunity and are encouraged to rise to new challenges. We are honored to join Secretary Cardona and the Department of Education in such an important and timely discussion.” Secretary Cardona highlighted the key focus areas of “Raise the Bar: Lead the World”: Achieving Academic Excellence Accelerating learning for every student Deliver a comprehensive and rigorous education for every student Boldly Improve Learning Conditions Eliminate the educator shortage for every school Invest in every student’s mental health and well-being Creating Pathways for Global Engagements Ensure every student has a pathway to college and career Provide every student a pathway to multilingualism Click here to view a full transcript of Secretary Cardona’s remarks."
19-Jan-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/department-awards-grants-improve-opportunities-and-outcomes-nations-postsecondary-students,Department Awards Grants to Improve Opportunities and Outcomes for Nation's Postsecondary Students,"U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona today announced 38 awards totaling more than $30 million to colleges and universities from five competitive grant programs of the Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education (FIPSE), which aims to improve higher education opportunities and outcomes for students from underrepresented communities. ""We cannot be complacent with a higher education system that leaves so many college students from diverse and underserved backgrounds without the supports and resources they need to succeed in school and, ultimately, graduate,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""The $30 million in grants announced today – including those of the new Postsecondary Student Success Program -- will help colleges and universities advance innovative and evidence-based strategies to better support their students and help address students' basic needs, launch affordable open textbook programs, improve campus resources for veterans, and create opportunities for youth who've struggled with violence to get their lives back on track. These investments reflect the Biden-Harris Administration's continued commitment to raising the bar for equitable outcomes in higher education and making sure students from all walks of life can thrive."" The grants are awarded under five FIPSE programs that target critical needs in our higher education system and are described below: Postsecondary Student Success Program ; Basic Needs for Postsecondary Students Program ; Open Textbooks Pilot Program ; Centers of Excellence for Veteran Student Success ; and Transitioning Gang-Involved Youth to Higher Education Program . Postsecondary Student Success Program Announced in August 2022, the Postsecondary Student Success Program is a new FIPSE grant program established by Congress in response to the Biden-Harris Administration's request for funding to address college completion issues. The Department recently received an additional $45 million in funding in the FY23 budget to expand the program to serve more students. The grants will help institutions invest in data-driven and evidence-based reforms to encourage postsecondary retention, transfer, and completion among students who are close to graduation, as well as those who temporarily withdrew from school because of challenges faced during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Department's first awards under this grant program total more than $4.5 million to five Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs), and community colleges. Basic Needs for Postsecondary Students Program The Basic Needs for Postsecondary Students Program provides grants to eligible institutions of higher education (IHEs) to address students' basic needs, including food, housing, transportation, and child care. The Department made 14 awards totaling more than $13 million to MSIs and community colleges. Open Textbooks Pilot Program The Open Textbooks Pilot Program supports efforts to create new open textbooks, which are openly licensed teaching, learning, and research resources that freely reside in the public domain or have been released under a license that permits their free use, reuse, modification, and sharing with others. By encouraging grant competition applicants to prioritize resources for courses with high enrollment and for high-demand career fields, the program aims to emphasize initiatives with the greatest potential to generate the highest level of cost savings for students. The Department awarded more than $2.5 million in new awards this fiscal year to two institutions. Centers of Excellence for Veteran Student Success Program The Centers of Excellence for Veteran Student Success Program helps institutions support veteran student success by coordinating services to address their academic, financial, physical, and social needs. The Department made 15 awards for more than $8.5 million. Transitioning Gang-Involved Youth to Higher Education Program Transitioning Gang-Involved Youth to Higher Education Program provides resources to IHEs for projects aimed at re-directing gang-involved youth toward postsecondary education opportunities that will lead to certification or credentials. The Department awarded a total of nearly $1 million to two institutions to support the transition of gang-involved youth to higher education. The FIPSE program was included in the 1972 reauthorization of the Higher Education Act to fund projects that encourage innovative reform and expand educational opportunities to historically underrepresented communities.

Promise Neighborhoods grants provide coordinated support services and programs to students from low-income backgrounds at every stage of their education from early childhood through their careers. For fiscal year 2022, four new grants totaling $23 million will focus on the implementation of services in neighborhoods that have never received support through the program. These services include high-quality early childhood education; high-quality, in-school and out-of-school time opportunities; and support for student transitions at each point in their academic careers, among others supports. Additionally, two existing grantees will receive a total of $4 million to expand services and scale results in their communities. To highlight the importance of these awards, U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona will visit two schools in Hazard, Kentucky that are supported by Partners for Rural Impact, one of the newest Promise Neighborhoods grantees. The Secretary will discuss the importance of strong school-based, pre-kindergarten programs that set students up for successful transitions to elementary school, secondary school, and beyond. Since its establishment in 2010, the Promise Neighborhoods program is now in 34 states with partnerships across 73 communities. Additionally, as part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s continued efforts to prevent and reduce community violence, the Department announced nearly $8 million in new grants to 11 school districts through Project Prevent. Project Prevent provides grants to local educational agencies (LEAs) impacted by community violence to expand the capacity of LEAs to implement community- and school-based strategies to help prevent community violence and mitigate the impacts of exposure to community violence for students. “Promise Neighborhoods support students from cradle to career by those who know them the best—their families and communities,” said Secretary Cardona. “The awards announced today will help raise the bar for supporting our children and young people by investing in better learning conditions in their own communities so they can realize their incredible potential through education—and across our nation. I’m thrilled that this year’s awards also include crucial investments in reducing the community violence that too often endangers our children, their families, and their prospect for the future. Our children deserve to learn in safe and supportive schools and communities.

Meeting the needs of the whole child is essential to help America’s students grow academically and improve their well-being. That’s why the Biden-Harris Administration is committed to supporting the adoption of community school models across the country, which provide comprehensive, integrated supports to our nation’s students, their families, and their communities. Community schools meet the unique needs of the neighborhoods they serve by leveraging local non-profit, private sector, and agency partnerships to bring services into school buildings. This includes services such as high-quality tutoring, health, mental health and nutrition services, and high-quality early learning programs, among others, for students and the community. “Community Schools are an essential component of accelerating our students’ learning and supporting their social, emotional, and mental health, and deepening community partnerships. At the height of the pandemic, community schools connected students and families with vital nutrition assistance, mental, physical, and other health services, and expanded learning opportunities. This work continues today because we know that students learn best when there is a comprehensive and holistic approach to meeting their needs,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “I am thrilled that through the historic investment we’re announcing now, the Department is funding the largest cohort of grantees in the history of this grant program. This represents a huge step toward the Biden-Harris Administration’s goal of doubling the number of Full-Service Community Schools across the country and raising the bar for our support of children.” This year’s grant competition received the largest number of applications in the history of the program, demonstrating the enormous need to have a continuum of coordinated support to address students’ academic, social, emotional and mental health needs. The new grantees are committed to implementing the four pillars of community schools: 1) integrated student supports that address out-of-school barriers to learning through partnerships with social and health service agencies and providers; 2) expanded and enriched learning time and opportunities; 3) active family and community engagement; and 4) collaborative leadership and practices. Community schools provide a range of services to meet the unique needs of the students, families, and broader communities they serve. Studies have found that well-implemented community schools—with integrated student supports, active family and community engagement, expanded and enriched learning time, and collaborative leadership practices—can lead to improved student and school outcomes, particularly for students in high-poverty schools. The White House today also released a new toolkit that outlines how federal grant funding from other government agencies, such as the Departments of Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, and Transportation can be used to support the implementation of the community school model. Today’s announcement comes while Secretary Cardona is at Turner Elementary School in Washington D.C., one of two District of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS) where FSCS funding will ensure a strong pipeline of services, and further demonstrate the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to providing a high-quality education for all students. DCPS is one of the 42 local educational agencies, non-profits, or other public or private entities and institutions of higher education to receive this funding. The Department conducted robust outreach to expand interest, and almost half of grantees in this cohort are first-time grantees. Notably, this cohort includes the first set of grantees in the history of the program that have expressed a commitment to scaling the community school model across the grantee’s state. With this award, the Department has awarded FSCS grants in 20 states and territories.

13-Jan-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-awards-project-serv-grants-north-carolina-central-university-philander-smith-college-and-hampton-university,"U.S. Department of Education Awards Project SERV Grants to North Carolina Central University, Philander Smith College, and Hampton University","Today, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) announced Project School Emergency Response to Violence (Project SERV) grants to three additional Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) that experienced bomb threats last year. North Carolina Central University in Durham, North Carolina was awarded $213,500; Philander Smith College in Little Rock, Arkansas was awarded $149,963; and Hampton University in Hampton, Virginia was awarded $214,317 in Project SERV grants, respectively. “The bomb threats made last year against several Historically Black Colleges and Universities not only shattered their campus communities’ sense of safety and created fear in students but strained institutions’ resources by prompting costly campus lockdowns, class cancellations, and law enforcement activities,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “As Secretary of Education, I categorically reject any and all efforts to terrorize Black students and educators and I am committed to ensuring access to Project SERV grants and all available federal resources to help HBCUs restore safe, welcoming, and nurturing learning environments. I’m pleased that these three grants will advance efforts by HBCU leaders to strengthen mental health supports, help students overcome these traumatic experiences, and invest in their campus security.” North Carolina Central University (NCCU) will use its Project SERV funds to address student safety concerns by providing a full-time care manager and Director’s LEAD (Learning, Empowering and Advocating for Diversity) Workshops. These workshops train faculty on recognizing impacts of PTSD and racial trauma. Delivered over six sessions, this training better prepares individuals to support students and aid in the overall safety climate at the university. NCCU also will fund a part-time case manager to be a first responder to reported crises on campus and aid in providing follow-up care to students who have been directly impacted, as well as support for their Campus Police Services. NCCU also will use Project SERV funds to pay overtime for five officers and six Residential Life staff who supported campus evacuation and student response after hours. Philander Smith College will use its Project SERV funds to hire three new security officers, including support for overtime hours, and support for a police department contracted security detail for a one-year period. Hampton University will use its Project SERV funds for the hiring of two full-time positions —one Trauma/Resilience Mental Health Specialist and one Psychology Technician. Hampton University also will be using Project SERV funds to support Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training (ASIST), which is aimed at addressing common trauma reactions that may include depression and risk for suicide. Additional HBCUs that also have been awarded Project SERV grants are Tougaloo College, Fayetteville State University, Southern University Law Center, Fisk University, and Coppin State University. “We’re pleased that these institutions are receiving the aid they deserve to ensure the well-being and safety of their students, staff, and faculty,” said Dietra Trent, Executive Director of the White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence and Economic Opportunity through Historically Black Colleges and Universities. “The Biden-Harris Administration is here to support our HBCU community, and we will continue working to promote policies and practices that fortify their strength and advance educational equity, excellence, and economic opportunity through these institutions.” Project SERV provides short-term funding for local educational agencies and institutions of higher education that have experienced a violent or traumatic incident to assist in restoring a safe environment conducive to learning. The Department expects additional grants to be awarded in the coming weeks and continues to work with additional HBCUs impacted to support them in the grant application process and in expediting applications once received. The Biden-Harris Administration continues to take a whole-of-government approach to support HBCU campuses. The Administration has delivered nearly $6 billion in cumulative investments to HBCUs, including: $3.7 billion through the American Rescue Plan and other COVID relief; $1.6 billion in capital finance debt relief; $1.4 million in Project SERV funds; and $500 million in grant funding to help HBCUs and other MSIs expand capacity."
11-Jan-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/statement-secretary-cardona-response-filing-student-debt-relief-amicus-briefs,Statement by Secretary Cardona in Response to Filing of Student Debt Relief Amicus Briefs,"U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona today issued the following statement in response to the filing of more than a dozen amicus curiae briefs with the U.S. Supreme Court in support of the Biden Administration’s student debt relief program: “The broad array of organizations and experts – representing diverse communities and different perspectives – supporting our case before the Supreme Court today reflects the strength of our legal positions versus the fundamentally flawed lawsuits aimed at denying millions of working and middle-class borrowers debt relief. As these diverse groups made clear today, student loan borrowers from all walks of life suffered profound financial harms during the pandemic and their continued recovery and successful repayment hinges on the Biden Administration’s student debt relief plan. We will continue to defend our legal authority to provide the debt relief working and middle-class families clearly need and deserve.” A summary of the briefs can be found HERE ."
9-Jan-23,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/new-proposed-regulations-would-transform-income-driven-repayment-cutting-undergraduate-loan-payments-half-and-preventing-unpaid-interest-accumulation,New Proposed Regulations Would Transform Income-Driven Repayment by Cutting Undergraduate Loan Payments in Half and Preventing Unpaid Interest Accumulation,"Today, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) proposed regulations to reduce the cost of federal student loan payments, especially for low and middle-income borrowers. The regulations fulfill the commitment President Biden laid out in August when he announced his Administration's pla n to provide student debt relief for approximately 40 million borrowers and make the student loan system more manageable for student borrowers. The proposed regulations would create the most affordable income-driven repayment (IDR) plan that has ever been made available to student loan borrowers, simplify the program, and eliminate common pitfalls that have historically delayed borrowers' progress toward forgiveness. ""Today the Biden-Harris administration is proposing historic changes that would make student loan repayment more affordable and manageable than ever before,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""We cannot return to the same broken system we had before the pandemic, when a million borrowers defaulted on their loans a year and snowballing interest left millions owing more than they initially borrowed. These proposed regulations will cut monthly payments for undergraduate borrowers in half and create faster pathways to forgiveness, so borrowers can better manage repayment, avoid delinquency and default, and focus on building brighter futures for themselves and their families."" The proposed regulations would amend the terms of the Revised Pay As You Earn (REPAYE) plan to offer $0 monthly payments for any individual borrower who makes less than roughly $30,600 annually and any borrower in a family of four who makes less than about $62,400. The regulations would also cut in half monthly payments on undergraduate loans for borrowers who do not otherwise have a $0 payment in this plan. The proposed regulations would also ensure that borrowers stop seeing their balances grow due to the accumulation of unpaid interest after making their monthly payments. While these regulations would provide critical relief to student borrowers, the Biden-Harris Administration is also committed to ensuring postsecondary institutions and programs are held accountable if they leave borrowers with unaffordable debts. The Department is currently working on a proposed gainful employment regulation that would cut off federal financial aid to career training programs that fail to provide sufficient financial value and require warnings for borrowers who attend any program that leaves graduates with excessive debts. The same regulatory package will also include proposals to strengthen the conditions that can be placed on institutions that fail to meet the requirements of the Higher Education Act or exhibit signs of risk. The Department is also taking steps today to carry out President Biden's announcement from August that the Department would publish a list of the programs at all types of colleges and universities that provide the least financial value to students. To advance this effort, the Department is publishing a request for information to seek formal public feedback on the best way to identify the programs that provide the least financial value for students. This public comment process will ensure the Department is carefully considering a range of perspectives and considerations as it constructs the list. Once the list is published, institutions with programs on this list will be asked to submit improvement plans to the Department to improve their financial value. Estimated effects of the proposed IDR Plan The proposed regulatory changes would substantially reduce monthly debt burdens and lifetime payments, especially for low and middle-income borrowers, community college students, and borrowers who work in public service. Overall, the Department estimates that the plan would have the following effects compared to the existing REPAYE plan: Future cohorts of borrowers would see their total payments per dollar borrowed decrease by 40%. Borrowers with the lowest projected lifetime earnings would see payments that are 83% less, while those in the top would only see a 5% reduction. A typical graduate of a four-year public university would save nearly $2,000 a year relative to the current REPAYE plan. A first-year teacher with a bachelor's degree would save more than $17,000 in total payments while pursuing Public Service Loan Forgiveness—a two-thirds reduction in what they would pay in total under REPAYE. 85% of community college borrowers would be debt-free within 10 years On average, Black, Hispanic, American Indian and Alaska Native borrowers would see their lifetime payments per dollar borrowed cut in half. Building on an Unparalleled Record of Debt Relief The draft regulations build upon the work the Biden-Harris Administration has already done to improve the student loan program, make colleges more affordable, approve $48 billion in targeted relief to nearly 2 million student loan borrowers, and fight to provide up to $20,000 in one-time debt relief to over 40 million eligible borrowers, including 26 million who have already applied. These regulations also propose to build on the Administration's commitment to ensuring IDR plans deliver relief to eligible borrowers. This includes ongoing steps to provide accurate counts of progress toward forgiveness for borrowers through a one-time account adjustment . The proposed regulations and request for information will be published in the Federal Register tomorrow. The public may comment on both documents through the Regulations.gov website for 30 days. The Department expects to finalize the rules later this year and aims to start implementing some provisions later this year, subject to any changes made based on public comments.

As part of this commitment, today the Departments of Education and Justice filed a legal brief with the Supreme Court explaining our legal authority under the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act to carry out our program of one-time, targeted debt relief. We remain confident in our legal authority to adopt this program that will ensure the financial harms caused by the pandemic don’t drive borrowers into delinquency and default. We are unapologetically committed to helping borrowers recover from the pandemic and providing working families with the breathing room they need to prepare for student loan payments to resume. As previously announced, student loan payments and interests will remain paused until the Supreme Court resolves the case because it would be deeply unfair to ask borrowers to pay debt they wouldn’t have to pay, were it not for meritless lawsuits.”"

This includes $18.4 billion for the Title I program, providing targeted resources to our most underserved students and making important progress toward this Administration’s commitment to triple Title I funding, and $150 million for Full-Service Community Schools, doubling funding for this critical program. The bipartisan package also makes important investments in our nation’s teachers through several grant programs that support a diverse and well-prepared educator workforce. These investments in our students and teachers will help our schools and communities thrive. “As students consider their options after high school, vital new funding in this package will help them by investing in creating new career pathway options for high school students -- and raising college completion rates for those who pursue an education beyond high school. To help more students from low-income backgrounds access the benefits of postsecondary education, this funding package also boosts the maximum Pell Grant by $500, which will help more students access college or career training and is the largest increase in 10 years. This lays the groundwork for doubling the grant by 2029. The Department will continue assessing funding approved for Federal Student Aid operations and remains committed to providing reliable access to federal aid, including Pell Grants. We are also committed to delivering a better-functioning and more equitable student loan system that makes higher education more affordable and attainable for all borrowers. “We at the U.S. Department of Education look forward to raising the bar on this progress to continue to deliver on the Biden-Harris Administration’s firm commitment to investing in education as the foundation of opportunity for our young people, for our working families, and for our nation.”"

Pursuant to the agreement, SECEP committed to take steps necessary to ensure that it does not use restraint and seclusion in a way that denies to students with disabilities the FAPE to which they are entitled under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act. OCR identified concerns that SECEP may have denied FAPE to students with disabilities when it did not reevaluate students after multiple incidents of restraint and seclusion and when students missed significant instructional time. “I thank SECEP for its commitment to reviewing the use of restraint and seclusion in its program, including reviewing the educational needs of students with disabilities, to ensure that SECEP is providing services that address those needs,” said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon. During its review, OCR investigated SECEP’s use of restraint and seclusion by reviewing information about incidents in which SECEP restrained and secluded students with disabilities starting in the 2016-2017 school year. OCR’s investigation identified concerns that students who had multiple incidents of restraints and seclusions lost educational time and services and that SECEP did not re-evaluate those students to determine whether they should receive additional or different supports and compensatory services. Additionally, OCR identified concerns with the adequacy of SECEP’s procedures, training, and recordkeeping. SECEP’s agreement to change its practices with respect to the use of restraint and seclusion, and its commitment to examine and remedy prior instances where restraint and seclusion of its students may have denied them a FAPE, reflect SECEP’s willingness to serve its students with disabilities. SECEP’s commitments to resolve the compliance review include: Formalizing its policy and procedures on the use of restraint and Modifying its recordkeeping system. Training staff on SECEP’s revised policy and procedures and new recordkeeping system. Reviewing files of currently enrolled students who were restrained and secluded since the start of the 2016-2017 school year to determine, in part, whether any student requires compensatory education for educational services missed due to incidents of restraint and Developing and implementing an internal assessment tool to monitor and oversee SECEP’s use of restraint and The letter to SECEP is available here and the resolution agreement is available here ."

OCR examined whether the district’s use of restraint and seclusion in the 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 school years denied its students with disabilities a FAPE in violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504), Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (Title II), and their implementing regulations. OCR determined that the district placed three of its students with disabilities in nonpublic school settings and violated their rights under Section 504 and Title II because the district: Failed to ensure that district staff making placement decisions for these students had access to and carefully considered information obtained about the use of physical restraint and/or seclusion with these students. Separately failed to ensure that those making decisions regarding behavioral interventions for these students were knowledgeable about each student, the meaning of the evaluation data, and the placement. Failed to reevaluate these students to determine whether the repeated use of restraint and seclusion for these students denied them a FAPE and if additional aids and services were appropriate to provide a FAPE. And, Denied a FAPE to all three students based on the above failures and resulting harms to the students. “I am grateful for Davis Joint Unified School District’s commitment to take important steps to ensure that its students with disabilities are not denied a free and appropriate public education as a result of the use of restraint or seclusion whether they are placed in district schools or nonpublic school settings,” said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon. “The tragic death of a child subjected to prolonged and repeated restraint at a school placement through this district underscores the urgency for school communities everywhere to carefully examine their restraint and seclusion practices to safeguard children in their care, in addition to their obligation to satisfy the federal civil rights laws we enforce.” Throughout the investigation, OCR found that one of these students died after being subjected to a prolonged restraint that was preceded by at least four other restraints by the nonpublic school of which the district was aware. It was further found that the other two students were subjected to repeated restraints and seclusions, costing each student multiple total days less classroom instruction than their peers who were not subject to such restraints and seclusions. OCR found that that district did not visit the nonpublic schools following notification of their repeated use of restraints and seclusions. Compliance concerns that the district did not document all restraints and seclusions and may have failed to identify all students subjected to restraint and seclusion were also identified by OCR. These documentation concerns, coupled with district staff not having access to complete information about restraint and seclusions, raised a related concern that parents did not consistently have access to the information needed to participate meaningfully on the IEP teams for their children. OCR did not find evidence that district schools used seclusion during the years reviewed, and, during these same years, OCR identified six district students whom district elementary school staff restrained in a total of 12 incidents. OCR did not identify compliance concerns regarding the restraints of these students. The district agreed to resolve the violations and compliance concerns OCR identified by making comprehensive changes to its policies, procedures, and training requirements with respect to the use of restraint and seclusion. The district’s policies already prohibited the use of seclusion, and the district agreed to ensure that none of its students would be placed in nonpublic schools until their staff were trained on these policies and the duty to comply with Section 504 and Title II. The district also agreed to remedy prior instances where restraint and seclusion of its students in non-public school settings denied or may have denied them a FAPE, and to develop a monitoring program to ensure that any future restraint or seclusion complies with Section 504 and Title II. The steps the district committed to take in the resolution agreement include: Revising its policies for restraint and seclusion to promote its compliance with Section 504, Title II, and their implementing regulations. Distributing the revised policies to parents, faculty, administrators, staff, and any nonpublic school employees providing special education services to district students. Developing and implementing a process and form to create and maintain records about the use of restraint and seclusion of district students, including district students placed in a nonpublic school. Providing training on the revised policies and the FAPE-related requirements of the Section 504 regulation to all teachers and administrators and other district staff who are members of IEP and Section 504 teams for students with disabilities. Ensuring that staff at nonpublic schools where district students are placed receive training on the district’s policies and the FAPE requirements of the Section 504. Providing an individual remedy for a student subjected to multiple instances of restraint and seclusion by convening a properly constituted IEP team to determine what compensatory services are appropriate for the student and by timely providing such services. Conducting a review to identify any district students who were restrained or secluded by staff at nonpublic schools from 2019 to the present, and to implement responsive remedies based on this review. And, Implementing a program to monitor the use of restraint and seclusion with students in district schools and nonpublic schools to safeguard their Section 504 and Title II.

This new Biden-Harris Administration initiative will help implement and scale equitable, high-quality STEM education for all students from PreK to higher education—regardless of background— to ensure their 21st century career readiness and global competitiveness. “Research shows how a sense of belonging in rich and rigorous classrooms is directly correlated to students’ long-term academic success. Moreover, the Department’s Civil Rights Data Collection continues to demonstrate that students of color and students with disabilities are disproportionately excluded from learning opportunities in STEM,” said U.S. Deputy Secretary of Education Cindy Marten. “Today, we are saying unequivocally to all students and educators that they belong in STEM and that they deserve to have rigorous and relevant educational experiences that inspire and empower them to reach their full potential as productive, contributing members of our nation’s workforce.” The new initiative unites government, nonprofits, professional organizations, industries, philanthropies, and other community stakeholders to take bold action towards breaking down long-standing barriers for student success in the STEM fields. With the support of $120 billion dollars dedicated to K-12 education in the American Rescue Plan (ARP) and all other federal education funds, the Department is galvanizing the broader education ecosystem to prioritize three goals for STEM education: Ensure all students from PreK to higher education excel in rigorous, relevant, and joyful STEM learning. Develop and support our STEM educators to join, grow, and stay in the STEM field. Invest in STEM education strategically and sufficiently using ARP and other federal, state, and local funds. These goals provide strategic direction for the Department’s STEM-related efforts to meet the most pressing needs of students and educators. Further, through this initiative, the Department calls on all states, districts, schools, and STEM-connected organizations and industries to make specific, tangible commitments aligned to these goals to provide all students with the experiences and resources they need to succeed in STEM and in life. In support of the initiative and its goals, the Department has: Published a Dear Colleague Letter to state and district leaders outlining how federal education funds can be used to enhance STEM teaching and learning. Announced a partnership with Beyond100K through an MOU. Beyond100K will partner with the Department to identify the key challenges to fully staffing schools with STEM teachers who reflect the diversity of their students and create classrooms of belonging. Beyond100K will also partner with the Department and other stakeholders to better understand and predict the supply and demand of STEM teachers at the state and local levels. Additionally, Beyond100K will co-sponsor a series of national communities of practices to support states, school districts, and other education organizations in developing and implementing innovative solutions to the STEM educator shortage and improve equitable access to high-quality STEM instruction for all students, especially those most excluded from STEM opportunity. Additionally, over 90 public and private sector organizations from across the country have made specific commitments to enhance STEM education. These commitments range from local grassroots efforts to initiatives that are national in scope. Several excerpts of example commitments include: Data Science for Everyone will assist 100+ school districts to leverage ARP and other funds for piloting and scaling data science education programs, impacting approximately 200,000 students, with a priority on serving Title I (~30%) and rural (~30%) communities; will launch working groups in 10 states to expand teacher training pathways into emerging technology education; will launch a research and development campaign for students with disabilities and other learning differences to engage in data science education by 2025. DiscoverE will create 10 million K-12 engineering experiences, 5 million of which will serve girls and underrepresented students. New York Hall of Science , through its STEM Equity Initiative, will engage over 300 three- and four-year-old students each year from the Corona community of Queens, New York, in its STEM-themed preschool through PreK program. Smithsonian Science Education Center at the Smithsonian Institute will provide professional development to over 100 K-12 STEM educators on Universal Design for Learning in STEM classrooms and on culturally based pedagogy in STEM classrooms; will also support 20 education entities representing over 10,000 STEM teachers with the goal of ensuring a diverse STEM teacher pipeline. STEM Next Opportunity Fund will expand the portfolios of Million Girls Moonshot partners to include local and regional STEM intermediaries and direct youth-serving organizations by investing an additional $1.5 million a year through 2025 to the existing $4 million planned; also by 2025 they will invest $8 million in developing a research agenda to increase public awareness of out-of-school time as a critical component of ensuring a sense of belonging for youth in STEM. A full list of the organizations can be found here . The YOU Belong in STEM National Coordinating Conference will welcome more than 200 STEM stakeholders from 30 states and territories in the Department’s Lyndon B. Johnson building in Washington, D.C. Participants will collaborate and learn about the importance of belonging in STEM, connect with students and educators about their experiences in STEM education, and develop new partnerships and commitments. We invite you to join us virtually for the opening (9 a.m. ET - 12:15 p.m. ET) and closing (4 p.m. ET - 4:45 p.m. ET) plenary sessions. Today’s actions and conference build on the progress school communities have made this year in helping students and families recover from the pandemic, as they respond to President Biden’s call to enlist 250,000 adult volunteers to support student success. This past summer, the Department launched two national initiatives—the National Partnership for Student Success (NPSS) and Engage Every Student — that focus on innovative ways to engage students and schools and support academic achievement and student wellness.

5-Dec-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-educations-office-civil-rights-announces-resolution-racial-harassment-investigation-ottumwa-community-school-district,U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights Announces Resolution of Racial Harassment Investigation of Ottumwa Community School District,"The U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) today announced the resolution of a racial harassment complaint filed against Ottumwa Community School District in Iowa. OCR determined that during the course of school years 2020-21 and 2021-22 district students subjected a Black middle school student to racial harassment so pervasive that it constituted a racially hostile environment and that the district failed to take necessary steps to protect the student, in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its implementing regulations. The harassment included repeated use of racial slurs including calling the student the N-word and a “slave” to white students as well as calling the student “blackie” and “cotton-picker,” targeting the student with monkey noises in class and students raising their fists to mock Black Power during class, a white student using the term KKK and then referring to it as the “Kool Kids Klub,” and telling racially derogatory jokes about, for example, killing a Black man and not being able to see Black people at midnight. In one instance, a white classmate knelt on a Gatorade bottle in the student’s presence and said, “It can’t breathe,” to mimic George Floyd’s death. The harassment the student experienced and the district’s failure to provide the student with a safe school environment caused him to suffer significant and enduring emotional harm. OCR also found that even though the district had notice of possible ongoing harassment, the district disregarded its obligations to investigate whether its response to the reported harassment was effective in eliminating the hostile environment, whether it addressed the cumulative effect of the incidents on the harassed student, and addressed the impact the verified wide-spread conduct may have had on other students. In so doing, the district did not take effective school-wide measures to address and remedy the racially hostile environment, which continued to exist at the school. The resolution agreement commits the district to take steps to ensure nondiscrimination based on race, color, or national origin (including based on shared ancestry and ethnic characteristics) in all of its education programs and activities. “Federal civil rights law has for decades promised that no student should experience the racially hostile environment that the young person in this investigation endured,” said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon. “I thank Ottumwa Community School District for committing today to take the steps necessary to ensure that in future it will respond appropriately to reports of racial harassment so every student in the district’s schools will experience the nondiscriminatory learning environment that federal law guarantees.” The district’s commitments in the voluntary resolution agreement include: Reimbursing the student’s parent for documented expenses incurred related to past and future therapeutic services resulting from the racially hostile environment. Publishing an anti-harassment statement stating that the district does not tolerate acts of harassment, including acts of harassment based on a student’s race, color, or national origin. Reviewing and revising its policies and procedures to address Title VI’s prohibition of harassment based on race, color, or national origin. Providing training to district staff regarding the district’s obligation to respond to complaints of harassment based on race, color, or national origin. Providing age-appropriate information programs for students to address harassment based on race, color, or national origin. And, Conducting a climate survey to assess the prevalence of harassment in the student’s former school and provide suggestions for effective ways to address harassment. The letter to Ottumwa Community School District is available here and the resolution agreement is available here ."

As required by the VAWA 2022 Reauthorization, the report focuses on recruiting, retaining, and training the Department of Education's highly qualified workforce who investigate complaints and enforce Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX) and section 485(f) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (Clery Act). The reauthorization of VAWA and the work of this Task Force continue a long commitment to action by President Biden, who was the primary Senate sponsor of the original Violence Against Women Act, which was enacted in 1994. The Task Force, which includes the U.S. Department of Education, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and U.S. Department of Justice, was established on Sept. 1, 2022. The VAWA 2022 Reauthorization required the Task Force's first report to be completed by Nov. 30, 2022, which is no later than 90 days after the Task Force's establishment. ""The Department of Education is fully committed to ensuring that every student has the right to learn in a safe environment free from harassment and sexual violence,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""Sexual violence prevention, particularly in educational settings, is critical,"" said U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra. ""This report is the first step to providing critical information about gaps in federal law enforcement and resources. HHS looks forward to working across the federal government to advance trauma-informed health care and advocacy services for survivors."" As required by Congress, the report provides information from the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights and the Clery Group within the office of Federal Student Aid on the following topics: An assessment to identify gaps or challenges in carrying out such investigation and enforcement, which may include surveying the current investigative workforce to solicit feedback on areas in need of improvement. An examination of issues of recruiting, retention, and the professional development of the current investigative workforce, including the possibility of providing retention bonuses or other forms of compensation for the purpose of ensuring the Department of Education has the capacity, in both personnel and skills, needed to properly perform its mission and provide adequate oversight of educational institutions.

OCR investigated the school division’s provision during the pandemic of a free appropriate public education (FAPE) to students with disabilities, as required by federal civil rights law. OCR’s investigation found that the school division failed to provide thousands of students with services identified in the students’ Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) and 504 plans during remote learning. For example, OCR found that the school division: Reduced and placed limits on services and special education instruction provided to students with disabilities based on considerations other than the students’ individual educational needs. Inaccurately informed staff that the school division was not required to provide compensatory education to students with disabilities who did not receive a FAPE during the COVID-19 pandemic because the school division was not at fault. Failed to develop and implement a plan adequate to remedy the instances in which students with disabilities were not provided a FAPE during remote learning. In addition, the evidence OCR gathered during investigation raised concerns that the school division did not accurately track services provided to students with disabilities. The school division agreed to resolve these violations and compliance concerns by creating and implementing a comprehensive plan to address the compensatory education needs of students with disabilities due to the COVID-19 pandemic. “I am relieved that the more than 25,000 students with disabilities in Fairfax County will now receive services federal law promises to them, even during a pandemic, to ensure their equal access to education,” said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon. Through implementation of the resolution agreement the school division will: Develop and implement a plan to appropriately assess and provide compensatory education to students with disabilities who did not receive a FAPE during the COVID-19 pandemic. Designate a plan administrator who will oversee the creation and implementation of the plan. Convene IEP and Section 504 teams to determine whether students were not provided the regular or special education and related aids and services designed to meet their individual needs during remote learning and determine compensatory education. Track and report to OCR the implementation of the plan for compensatory education. Provide written guidance and/or training about the plan to all division staff with responsibilities under Section 504 and Title II. And, Conduct outreach to parents, guardians, students, and other stakeholders to publicize the plan for compensatory education. The Department has released a wide variety of resources addressing schools’ responsibility to ensure that students with disabilities continue to receive appropriate educational services during the pandemic. Those include: Secretary Cardona’s Letter to Educators and Parents Regarding New CDC Recommendations and their Impact on Children with Disabilities . (March 24, 2022) OCR’s Fact Sheet: Providing Students with Disabilities Free Appropriate Public Education During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Addressing the Need for Compensatory Services Under Section 504 (Feb. 17, 2022) The Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services’ Return to School Roadmap: Development and Implementation of Individualized Education Programs in the Least Restrictive Environment (Sept. 30, 2021) OCR’s September 2021 resource collection, Back to School: Supporting Educational Environments Free from Discrimination The letter to Fairfax County Public Schools is available here and the resolution agreement is available here .

22-Nov-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-continues-fight-student-debt-relief-millions-borrowers-extends-student-loan-repayment-pause,"Biden-Harris Administration Continues Fight for Student Debt Relief for Millions of Borrowers, Extends Student Loan Repayment Pause","Today, the U.S. Department of Education announced an extension of the pause on student loan repayment, interest, and collections. The extension will alleviate uncertainty for borrowers as the Biden-Harris Administration asks the Supreme Court to review the lower-court orders that are preventing the Department from providing debt relief for tens of millions of Americans. Payments will resume 60 days after the Department is permitted to implement the program or the litigation is resolved, which will give the Supreme Court an opportunity to resolve the case during its current Term. If the program has not been implemented and the litigation has not been resolved by June 30, 2023 – payments will resume 60 days after that. “Callous efforts to block student debt relief in the courts have caused tremendous financial uncertainty for millions of borrowers who cannot set their family budgets or even plan for the holidays without a clear picture of their student debt obligations, and it’s just plain wrong,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “I want borrowers to know that the Biden-Harris Administration has their backs and we’re as committed as ever to fighting to deliver essential student debt relief to tens of millions of Americans. We’re extending the payment pause because it would be deeply unfair to ask borrowers to pay a debt that they wouldn’t have to pay, were it not for the baseless lawsuits brought by Republican officials and special interests.” On August 24, President Biden and Secretary Cardona announced plans to provide targeted student debt relief to borrowers with loans held by the Department of Education. Borrowers with annual income during the pandemic of under $125,000 (for individuals) or under $250,000 (for married couples or heads of households) who received a Pell Grant in college would be eligible for up to $20,000 in debt cancellation. Targeted student debt relief addresses the financial harms of the pandemic, provides borrowers with smooth transition back to repayment and helps borrowers at highest risk of delinquencies or default once payments resume. To date, over 26 million people have provided the Department with the necessary information to be considered for debt relief, and 16 million borrowers have been approved. But court orders are blocking the Department from discharging student loan debt and accepting additional applications. Last week, the Department of Justice requested that the Supreme Court lift the lower court’s injunction against the program and suggested that if the Court does not do so, it could take up the student debt relief case, to provide borrowers the clarity and relief they are depending on. Borrowers can use the additional time to ensure their contact information is up to date with their loan servicers and consider enrolling in electronic debit and income-driven repayment plans to support a smooth transition to repayment. More information can be found at StudentAid.gov. In addition to providing relief specifically targeted to alleviating the continuing economic effects of the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, the Biden-Harris Administration has also taken other steps to support students and borrowers, make higher education more affordable, and improve student loan servicing, including providing nearly $48 billion in targeted loan relief to over 1.8 million borrowers. Actions within that include: Revamping the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program in October, which has provided $24 billion in loan relief to 360,000 borrowers. The Department’s Limited PSLF Waiver helped eligible borrower count all prior payments made by student borrowers toward PSLF, regardless of the loan program. Giving borrowers with Direct Loans or Department-managed Federal Family Education Loans (FFEL) more credit toward forgiveness. The Department’s one-time account adjustment counts for all months spent in repayment, including payments prior to consolidation and regardless of whether they made partial or late payments or are on a repayment plan toward income-driven repayment (IDR) and PSLF forgiveness. Establishing a fair and accessible bankruptcy discharge process to help struggling borrowers discharge their student loans. Providing $9.1 billion in relief for 425,000 borrowers who have a total and permanent disability. Approving $14.5 billion in borrower defense claims to nearly 1.1 million borrowers, including extending full relief to approved claims and approving new types of claims. Providing $1.26 billion in closed school discharges to 107,000 borrowers who attended the now-defunct ITT Technical Institute. Restoring eligibility for financial student aid to almost 7.5 million borrowers to help them complete their credential or degree."

This new effort unites key agencies of the Biden-Harris Administration to strengthen the connection between K-12 education, postsecondary education, and workforce programs. With the support of the $120 billion dollars dedicated to K-12 education in the American Rescue Plan (ARP) and Perkins funding , the Administration is ensuring the next generation is building the skills necessary to fill high-paying jobs like those created by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and CHIPS and Science Act . This includes expanding access to skills-based learning and training pathways, like Registered Apprenticeships in key industries such as advanced manufacturing, automotive, and cybersecurity. As part of today’s launch, the Department is announcing $5.6 million dollars in Perkins funding for a new program to expand work-based learning opportunities for students and this morning will issue new guidance on how federal funds can be used to develop and expand career pathway programs, including Registered Apprenticeships. As part of this new initiative, the Department will host regional summits with students, educators, employers, and other stakeholders to learn about practices that have led to success and challenges that must be addressed. “It’s time we bridge the divide between our K-12 systems and our college, career, and industry preparation programs, which leave too many students behind and perpetuate inequities in our most diverse, underserved, and rural communities,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona . “An education system reimagined for the 21st century engages youth of all ages in the power of career-connected learning and provides every student with the opportunity to gain real-life work experience, earn college credits, and make progress towards an industry credential before they graduate high school. Today, the Biden-Harris team is raising the bar with new investments and resources to support intentional collaboration between schools, colleges, workforce development agencies and industry partners and build clearer pathways for students to rewarding careers and lifelong success.” In support of today’s launch, the First Lady Jill Biden, Secretary Miguel Cardona, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, and U.S. Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh will travel to northwest suburban Chicago, Illinois to meet with students enrolled in a career-connected learning program at Rolling Meadows High School. The Secretaries and the First Lady will also visit Aon’s Chicago facility hosted by the Chicago Apprenticeship Network to highlight the value of Registered Apprenticeship, particularly in non-traditional industries and corporate careers with a focus on underrepresented populations and communities in key sectors of technology, finance, insurance, and banking. The visits coincide with the first day of National Apprenticeship Week, marking the 85th Anniversary of the National Apprenticeship Act. “America is home to some of the world’s brightest and most ambitious students, and we owe it to them to set them up for success,” said U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo. “Career-connected education programs are essential to the success of the American economy and will spur a new generation of researchers, engineers, and manufacturers in critical industries. In launching this initiative, these programs and their graduates will enable us to continue outcompeting and out-innovating the rest of the world.” “During National Apprenticeship Week, the Biden-Harris administration is highlighting Registered Apprenticeship as a proven and industry-driven training model to address some of our nation’s most pressing workforce challenges,” said U.S. Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh. “The federal initiative announced today will further support private-public partnerships that help youth across the country access a college education, good-paying jobs, and strong pathways to the middle class.” Today’s announcements include: Investing $5.6 million in Perkins funding for schools to expand work-based learning opportunities The Department announced that it will launch the “Career Z Challenge: Expanding Work-Based Learning Opportunities” competition in Spring 2023. The competition will foster multi-sector partnerships and expand work-based learning opportunities for students. Semi-finalists and finalists will be eligible to receive targeted technical assistance including professional development support, webinars and training, as well as a portion of a prize pool. Providing new guidance to schools on using American Rescue Plan funds to expand career pathways for students to pursue in-demand jobs and support Registered Apprenticeships The Department will publish a Dear Colleague Letter that provides information on how schools can use ARP funds to develop and expand career pathway programs and help more students pursue careers in in-demand fields. This initiative builds on President Biden’s FY 2023 Budget proposal, which invests $200 million in Career-Connected High Schools and supports competitive grants to grow and build models of this bold vision. Funding would also support partnerships between local educational agencies, institutions of higher education—including community colleges—and employers, to encourage earning college credit while in high school through dual enrollment in core content and career and technical coursework; work-based learning opportunities; and academic and career counseling. President Biden’s FY 2023 Budget proposal also includes $1.4 billion for Career and Technical Education (CTE) programs. This includes an increase of $20 million for CTE state grants that would expand access to career-connected programs for more students.

During the investigation of this complaint, OCR received information that boys' baseball at a district school has superior playing fields, dugouts, bullpens, fencing, landscaping, bleachers, batting cages, and storage compared to what is provided for girls' softball and that boys' baseball players have access to a team room, whereas girls' softball players do not. OCR also received information that the district provides boys' baseball teams with superior and newer uniforms than the district provides for girls' softball teams. Finally, OCR received information reflecting that the girls' softball teams also have less opportunity to receive coaching as compared to the boys' baseball teams because the girls' softball head coach does not receive a prep period to prepare the fields immediately before practices and games, but the boys' baseball head coach does receive such a prep period. To resolve this investigation, the district agreed to conduct assessments of the facilities, equipment and supplies, and opportunities to receive coaching provided to the boys' and girls' interscholastic athletic teams at the school to ensure that members of both sexes are provided with equivalent benefits, opportunities, and treatment. Based on the district's assessment, the agreement requires that the district create and implement a corrective action plan to remedy any identified inequities between girls' and boys' interscholastic athletic teams at the school with respect to the areas of concern identified. ""As we celebrate the 50th anniversary of Title IX this year and the progress that continues nationally to ensure all students have equal opportunities to participate in athletic activities, Salem-Keizer School District No. 24J commits to important steps today to support girls' athletics on an equal basis with boys',"" said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E.

31-Oct-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/education-department-releases-final-regulations-expand-and-improve-targeted-debt-relief-programs,Education Department Releases Final Regulations to Expand and Improve Targeted Debt Relief Programs,"Today, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) released final regulations that streamline and improve the rules for major targeted debt relief programs. The regulations expand eligibility, remove barriers to relief, and encourage automatic discharges for borrowers who are eligible for loan relief because their school closed, they have a total and permanent disability, or their loan was falsely certified. The rules also establish a fairer process for borrowers to raise a defense to repayment, while preserving borrowers’ day in court by preventing institutions of higher education (institutions) from forcing students to sign away their legal rights using mandatory arbitration agreements and class action waivers. Finally, the rules help borrowers avoid spiraling student loan balances by eliminating all instances of interest capitalization not required by statute, which occur when unpaid interest is added to a borrower’s principal balance, increasing the total amount that borrowers may have to pay. “Today is a monumental step forward in the Biden-Harris team’s efforts to fix a broken student loan system and build one that’s simpler, fairer, and more accountable to borrowers,” U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona said. “These transformational changes will protect students who’ve been cheated by their colleges from the bureaucratic nightmares of the past and ensure that all our targeted debt relief programs live up to the promises made by Congress in the Higher Education Act. We’re also protecting borrowers from higher costs by limiting the practice of tacking unpaid student loan interest onto their principal balances."" These rules will go into effect July 1, 2023, which is the effective date specified in the Higher Education Act for regulations issued on or prior to November 1 of a given year. They reflect extensive stakeholder input across the higher education community, including from multiple public hearings, three negotiated rulemaking sessions conducted last fall, and more than 5,000 public comments received this summer. “Borrowers entitled to debt relief under the Higher Education Act should be able to get it without wading through red tape and confusing tricks and traps,” said Under Secretary James Kvaal. “The regulations announced today will streamline a needlessly complicated system and give borrowers a simpler and more often automatic path to the discharges they deserve. They also stop shady schools from forcing students to sign their rights away as part of the price for admission and give the Department critical tools for holding colleges that take advantage of borrowers accountable.” Borrower Defense to Repayment and Arbitration The new rule establishes a strong framework for borrowers to raise a defense to repayment if their institution misleads or manipulates them. This includes the ability to decide claims individually or as a group, which can be formed by the Secretary or in response to a request from a state entity, such as an attorney general, or a nonprofit legal assistance organization. Claims may be based on one of five categories of actionable circumstances: substantial misrepresentation, substantial omission of fact, breach of contract, aggressive and deceptive recruitment, or judgments or final secretarial actions. It will apply to all claims pending on or received on or after July 1, 2023. The final rule includes only the provision of full relief, a change from the proposed rule, which allowed for partial discharges. Approved claims require a conclusion, based upon a preponderance of the evidence, that the institution committed an act or omission which caused the borrower detriment of such a nature and degree that warrant full relief. The rule also lays out a clear process for the Department to pursue institutions for the cost of approved claims. For loans issued prior to July 1, 2023, the Department may pursue recoupment if the claims would have been approved under the borrower defense standards in place at the time the loan was issued. For discharges of loans issued before that date, institutions will only face recoupment if those claims would have been approved under the regulatory standards in place at the time the loans were issued. The final rule also allows borrowers to take their case to court by preventing institutions that participate in the Direct Loan program from requiring borrowers to engage in pre-dispute arbitration or sign class action waivers. The rule creates an easier path for borrowers whose loans were falsely certified to receive a discharge Closed School Discharges Too many borrowers have not obtained discharges they were eligible for after their school closed and end up in default. The final rules will provide an automatic discharge one year after a college’s closure date for borrowers who were enrolled at the time of closure or left 180 days before closure and who do not accept an approved teach-out agreement or a continuation of the program at another location of the school. Those who accept but do not complete a teach-out agreement or program continuation will receive a discharge one year after their last date of attendance. Total and Permanent Disability Discharges The final rule provides additional pathways for borrowers who have a total and permanent disability to receive a discharge. This includes allowing borrowers who receive additional types of disability review codes from the Social Security Administration (SSA) to qualify for a discharge. This also includes borrowers who later aged into retirement benefits and are no longer classified by one of these codes. Borrowers who have an established onset date of their disability determined by SSA to be at least 5 years in the past can also establish eligibility. The final rule also expands these categories to include borrowers whose first continuing disability review is scheduled at three years, a change from the draft rule, which required such a status to have been continued once. The rule also eliminates the three-year income monitoring requirement that too often caused borrowers to lose their discharges solely because they failed to respond to paperwork requests. Interest Capitalization Interest capitalization occurs when borrowers have outstanding unpaid interest added to their principal balance. After interest capitalizes, borrowers are then charged greater amounts of interest on that larger principal balance. The final rule eliminates all instances where interest capitalization is not required by statute. This means interest will no longer be added to a borrower’s principal balance the first time a borrower enters repayment, upon exiting a forbearance, and leaving any income-driven repayment plan besides Income-Based Repayment. This includes the Pay As You Earn (PAYE) and Revised Pay As You Earn (REPAYE) plans. Public Service Loan Forgiveness As announced last week, the rules also provide significant benefits for borrowers who are seeking Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF). Further information on the permanent improvements made to PSLF regulations can be found here. False Certification The final regulation streamlines the process for when a college falsely certifies a borrower’s eligibility for student loans when, in fact, the student was ineligible. This rule will provide borrowers with an easier path to a discharge. Improvements expand allowable documentation, clarify the applicable dates for a discharge and allow for the consideration of group discharges. Building on an Unparalleled Record of Debt Relief The final regulations build upon the work the Biden-Harris Administration has already done to improve the student loan program, make colleges more affordable, deliver tens of millions in debt relief to over one million student loan borrowers, and most recently provide debt relief to over 40 million eligible borrowers.

Their academic credentials, diverse perspectives, and years of experience in education make them eminently qualified to advise and oversee our Department’s independent research arm, the Institute of Education Sciences. At a moment of so many challenges and opportunities in education, we must ensure that educators, school and district leaders, and support staff have access to high-quality, nonpartisan research and practical, data-driven strategies to close achievement gaps and support student success.” Background on the National Board for Education Sciences The National Board for Education Sciences is established as part of the Institute of Education Sciences (Institute).The Ins titute’s mission is to provide national leadership in expanding fundamental knowledge and understanding of education from early childhood through postsecondary study, in order to provide parents, educators, students, researchers, policymakers, and the general public with reliable information about the condition and progress of education in the United States, the educational practices that support learning and improve academic achievement and access to educational opportunities for all students, and the effectiveness of federal and other education programs."

""Today, we're raising the bar for oversight and accountability for colleges and career schools that prioritize profiting off federal financial aid programs over preparing students for success in the workforce,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""These new rules crack down on some of the most deceptive practices we see in higher education, such as predatory marketing tactics that target U.S. service members and veterans, and changes in ownership designed to evade accountability to taxpayers. I'm also proud that starting July 1, 2023, incarcerated students will have access to federal Pell Grants to enroll in high-quality prison education programs that we know reduce their risk of returning to prison and prepare these individuals to lead productive and meaningful lives in their communities."" ""Veterans and their families deserve the very best education America has to offer,"" said U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Secretary Denis McDonough. ""It's our job at VA and across the federal government to deliver on that promise, making sure that veterans and their families not only have access to affordable education through the GI Bill – but also that they are protected from education fraud and abuse. Even though this final rule has no direct impact on GI Bill eligibility, our continued collaboration with ED to implement this critical change is paramount to our efforts to serve veterans and protect the integrity of the GI Bill."" The final regulations include: A strengthened 90/10 rule that increases protections for veterans and service members from aggressive recruiting by proprietary schools. Prison education program rules that set standards for public and private, non-profit institutions to implement effective prison education programs that can provide incarcerated individuals with the education they need to pursue a second chance at life inside and outside of prison. New accountability rules for colleges and universities undergoing changes in ownership to reduce risks to students and taxpayers often generated by complex changes in ownership transactions. 90/10 Rule These regulations implement an important change made by the American Rescue Plan, which was signed into law by President Biden in 2021. That law closed a longstanding loophole in the Higher Education Act that allowed for-profit colleges to aggressively recruit veterans and service members. The statute requires for-profit colleges to prove their value in the private market. These colleges must obtain 10 percent of their revenue from non-federal sources, but the statute allowed these colleges to count federal dollars outside of the student aid system—such as G.I. Bill benefits—toward their private market test. The American Rescue Plan closed this loophole. The revised definition means institutions will no longer be able to count money from veteran and service member benefits toward that 10 percent revenue requirement. This is particularly critical because the loophole generated incentives for some for-profit colleges to aggressively target their marketing to veterans and service members. Every $1 brought in from those students meant they could receive $9 more in Department of Education aid without needing to secure any private investment. The new regulation implements this statutory change and explains how the Department will identify which federal funds can no longer be counted toward the 10 percent revenue requirement. It also addresses other loopholes used by colleges to manipulate the timing of when they received revenue and counting funds from unrelated programs. These regulations will apply to institutional fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2023, consistent with the effective date of the statutory changes to the 90/10 calculation. Prison Education Programs Enrollment in postsecondary education programs is proven to reduce incarcerated individuals' risk of returning to prison by 28%, and reductions in recidivism also imply improvements in public safety. Congress recently established eligibility for Pell Grants for incarcerated individuals enrolled in qualifying prison education programs, effective July 1, 2023. In the interim, the Department has expanded its Second Chance Pell Experimental Sites Initiative to serve incarcerated individuals in nearly every state. The Department has also announced that incarcerated individuals are eligible for FSA's "" Fresh Start "" initiative, which will help borrowers with defaulted loans access low monthly payments based on their income and allow them to access Pell Grants to help them resume their educational journey. Change in Ownership A growing number of colleges and universities undergo often-complex changes in ownership transactions. In fact, the U.S. Government Accountability Office raised warnings that change in ownership may include ""insider involvement,"" presenting risks to students and taxpayers. To expand protections for students and taxpayers, the Department is clarifying the requirements and processes institutions must follow for changes in ownership. The new regulations update the definition of a nonprofit institution to prevent improper financial benefits to a former owner or other affiliate of a college. Additionally, institutions undergoing a change in ownership will be required to notify both the Department and the institution's students at least 90 days prior to the change to ensure advance notice is provided. Institutions undergoing a change in ownership may also be required to provide additional financial protection or to comply with additional conditions to protect against the risk of the transaction. This regulatory package is the latest step in the Biden-Harris Administration's continued commitment to ensure that colleges and universities are held accountable and that all students have access to a valuable postsecondary education. The proposed regulations released in July were negotiated by two committees of stakeholders in 2021 and reflected significant input from the community, as well as consensus agreements among negotiators for the regulations covering the 90/10 Rule and prison education programs. Following the federal Notice of Proposed Rulemaking process, the draft regulations were announced and posted to the Federal Register in July . The final rules, bolstered by input from dozens of public comments by a range of stakeholders during the 30-day public comment process that followed, will take effect July 1, 2023. Building on an Unparalleled Record of Debt Relief Today's announcement is part of the Biden-Harris Administration's broader efforts to get students and borrowers the benefits to which they are entitled. These efforts include enacting lasting policies to make college more affordable and preventing a future debt crisis by holding schools accountable for leaving students with mountains of debt and without the skills and preparation to find good jobs. On August 24, President Biden announced his plan to provide up to $20,000 in debt relief to more than 40 million eligible borrowers. Approximately 22 million people have already given the Department the information it needs to consider this relief. In addition, more than $38 billion in targeted student loan relief has been approved for 1.75 million borrowers. This includes: More than $14 billion for 1 million borrowers whose institutions took advantage of them through discharges related to borrower defense and school closures; More than $14 billion for over 236,000 borrowers through the PSLF Program; and More than $9 billion in total and permanent disability discharges for more than 425,000 borrowers.

25-Oct-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/education-department-announces-permanent-improvements-public-service-loan-forgiveness-program-and-one-time-payment-count-adjustment-bring-borrowers-closer-forgiveness,Education Department Announces Permanent Improvements to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program and One-time payment Count Adjustment to Bring Borrowers Closer to Forgiveness,"Today, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) announced one-time executive actions that will bring most loans managed by the Department closer to forgiveness, including credit toward the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Program for borrowers who have qualifying employment. This action will coincide with the July 2023 implementation of permanent fixes to PSLF through regulation. These actions will provide borrowers with many of the same benefits already going to those who have applied for PSLF under the temporary changes (known as the “Limited PSLF Waiver”), before its October 31, 2022 end date. Borrowers with Direct Loans or Department-managed Federal Family Education Loans (FFEL) will receive credit toward forgiveness on income-driven repayment (IDR) for all months spent in repayment, including payments prior to consolidation and regardless of whether they made partial or late payments or are on a repayment plan. Borrowers will also receive credit for specific periods in deferment and forbearance. The Department strongly encourages borrowers to take the necessary steps to apply for the waiver by October 31, 2022. “I’m incredibly proud that the Biden-Harris team’s temporary changes to Public Service Loan Forgiveness helped over 236,000 teachers, nurses, veterans, government employees and other public service workers secure more than $14 billion in debt relief,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “Today, we’re encouraging public service workers to take advantage of the program’s temporary changes before the deadline on October 31. At the same time, we’re taking bold steps that will automatically move more hardworking public service workers closer to forgiveness and making permanent changes to reduce the red tape that riddled the PSLF program. The Biden-Harris team is as committed as ever to upholding the promise of PSLF and ensuring borrowers who devote their careers to teaching our children, strengthening our communities, and serving our nation get the relief they’ve earned.” Ensuring Borrowers Receive Credit for Years in Repayment In April 2022, the Department announced one-time improvements to address historic inaccuracies in the count of payments that qualify toward forgiveness under IDR as well as practices by loan servicers to put borrowers into forbearance in violation of Department rules. As a result of these past failures, borrowers who were in repayment for 20 or 25 years or longer are unable to receive forgiveness under IDR, and borrowers who were in repayment for 10 years or longer while working in public service may not receive PSLF. To address these inaccuracies, the Department will adjust a borrower’s account by granting credit toward IDR and PSLF for: Any month in which a borrower was in a repayment status, regardless of whether payments were partial or late, the loan type, or the repayment plan; Any month in which loans were in an eligible repayment, deferment, or forbearance status prior to consolidation; Months while a borrower spent at least 12 months of consecutive forbearance; Months while a borrower spent at least 36 cumulative months in forbearance; and Any month spent in deferment (exception for in-school deferment) prior to 2013. Beginning in November 2022, borrowers who have 20 years (240 monthly payments) or 25 years (300 monthly payments) of payments through these changes will start receiving loan discharges. Borrowers who applied for PSLF prior to October 31, 2022 and reach 120 payments due to the deferment and forbearance changes will also receive loan discharges. The Department will continue implementing discharges for borrowers who reach the thresholds for forgiveness in the months after November 2022. In July 2023, the Department will automatically apply the same payment count treatment to all Direct and Department-managed FFEL loans for borrowers who do not otherwise reach the number of months necessary for forgiveness. Permanent Improvements to PSLF Regulations The Department also announced lasting improvements to the PSLF program that will be codified in final regulations. These improvements, which incorporate many elements of the PSLF waiver, include: Allowing borrowers to obtain credit for late, partial, and lump sum payments if the borrower also certifies qualifying employment. Awarding credit for certain months in deferment or forbearance, such as those tied to military service or deferments for economic hardship or cancer treatment if the borrower also certifies qualifying employment. A more complete list of the improvements can be found in the fact sheet . The regulations will be published in the coming days and will go into effect July 1, 2023. Steps to Qualify for the Limited PSLF Waiver by October 31 The program changes outlined in the fact sheet provide significant benefits to borrowers who have Direct or Department-managed FFEL loans as well as Direct Loan borrowers seeking PSLF now and in the future. However, any borrower interested in the full benefits of the Limited PSLF Waiver should take action by October 31.

24-Oct-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/secretary-cardona-speaks-parents-about-academic-recovery-following-nations-report-card,Secretary Cardona Speaks to Parents About Academic Recovery Following Nation’s Report Card,"Today, U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona joined a roundtable with parents from Fort Foote Elementary School in Fort Washington, Maryland, about what the school is doing to help their students catch up. Following the release of the latest Nation’s Report Card showing a decline for fourth- and eighth-graders in mathematics and reading between 2019 and 2022, released today by the U.S. Department of Education’s National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), Secretary Cardona spoke about how critical the Administration’s work was and continues to be to get and keep students back in classrooms and to get American Rescue Plan (ARP) dollars into communities to accelerate academic recovery and provide mental health supports to students. “American Rescue Plan dollars are a down payment on transformational change in education. We need to maintain urgency – and we have to change the conversation from going back to what we had before the pandemic to doing better for our children. If we do what we’ve done, we’re going to get what we’ve gotten,” said Secretary Cardona. During this closed press event, parents spoke candidly about the support their students have received from Fort Foote Elementary and from the district, citing the strong leadership and focus on the whole-child approach. “Community helps make sure that students are seen. My son was energetic and extroverted and needed to get back to school – but he didn’t have confidence academically. My daughter was doing great academically, but not well socially – she could have flown under the radar. Being here helped me realize that,” said one parent. “My son was always a very good student, but during virtual learning, I saw a lag. He became disinterested. He needed help with his homework. His math teacher engaged with him online – and she even turned math concepts into a song. We will always remember her,” said another parent. Secretary Cardona ended the session by saying, “My message to parents is this: your voice matters more than you know. This is an opportunity to level up. We need to build capacity with families not only to raise the bar and lift up best practices, but to hold us accountable for meeting students’ needs.” Secretary Cardona recently spoke to reporters in-depth about the latest data. His full remarks can be found here . Because this was a top priority of President Biden since Day One: Our nation’s schools went from 46% open for in-person instruction to 100% open full-time and in-person today. The President fought to get teachers eligible for vaccination early on so they could safely open their classrooms. President Biden and congressional Democrats passed the ARP, which invested $130 billion so schools could reopen and stay open safely, as well as address the longer-term impacts of the pandemic, including learning loss. President Biden called on leaders to use these funds in high-impact ways that support student learning, including tutoring, after-school programs, and hiring educators and school mental health professionals, including counselors. While the Nation’s Report Card make clear that we still have a long way to go, particularly in math, we are seeing hopeful signs for students’ academic recovery: 22 states and jurisdictions saw no statistically significant decline in fourth-grade reading scores since before the pandemic. 17 of 26 urban districts included in the Nation’s Report Card showed no statistically significant decline in fourth-grade reading, and 21 of 26 showed no statistically significant decline in eighth-grade reading, with one district showing a statistically significant increase. However, the work is far from over. The Department of Education will work with states and districts to make sure that ARP funds are helping students recover academically as quickly as possible and that schools are meeting their needs."
24-Oct-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/statement-us-secretary-education-miguel-cardona-nations-report-card,Statement by U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona on Nation’s Report Card,"Since Day One, the Biden-Harris Administration has worked aggressively to safely reopen schools, help students recover academically, and support their mental health, because President Biden knew that a once-in-a generation pandemic would have a once-in-a-generation impact on our nation’s students. The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) results should be a rallying cry to local, state, and national leaders to redouble their efforts to support learning recovery. But they also show how critical the Administration’s work was and continues to be to get and keep students back in classrooms and to get American Rescue Plan (ARP) dollars into communities to accelerate academic recovery and provide mental health supports to students. Below is a statement from U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona on the latest results: “The results released today from the National Assessment of Educational Progress are appalling, unacceptable, and a reminder of the impact that this pandemic has had on our learners. The data also represent a call to action for the important work we must do now for our students—especially those who have suffered the most during the pandemic. “This once-in-a-generation virus upended our country in so many ways -- and our students cannot be the ones who sacrifice most now or in the long run. We must treat the task of catching our children up in reading and math with the urgency this moment demands. “I’ve been in education for a long time, and this Administration did more for education in its first six months than any in decades. This Administration, unlike the previous one, actually delivered the swift and safe reopening of schools. This Administration broke with its predecessor from Day One by providing an actual plan to tackle learning loss– with concrete support and guidance for schools. This Administration fought for the historic resources in the American Rescue Plan – for which no Republican Member of Congress voted. “Schools across the country—in red and blue states—are using ARP funds to invest in high-impact strategies that we know result in learning gains and support students’ mental health, including hiring more teachers, tutors, and mental health professionals and expanding afterschool programs. “Our hardworking educators—trained professionals with deep knowledge of how to support their students—are achieving results for their students with unprecedented resources. “In the coming days, the Department will issue another resource on using American Rescue Plan funds to address learning loss for educators and state and district leaders. We will launch a new, expert-led series on the most promising tools to raise the bar and accelerate students’ learning in math and literacy. And we already have published a checklist to make sure parents have the tools they need to ensure their children are getting the support they deserve using federal relief dollars. “The time is now. This is our moment. It’s up to all of us to raise the bar in education.” Secretary Cardona recently spoke to reporters in-depth about the latest data. His full remarks can be found here . Because this was a top priority of President Biden since Day One: Our nation’s schools went from 46 percent open for in-person instruction to 100 percent open full-time and in-person today.

President Biden called on leaders to use these funds in high-impact ways that support student learning, including tutoring, after-school programs, and hiring educators and school mental health professionals, including counselors. While the NAEP results make clear that we still have a long way to go, particularly in math, we are seeing hopeful signs for students’ academic recovery: 22 states and jurisdictions saw no statistically significant decline in 4th grade reading scores since before the pandemic. 17 of 26 urban districts included in the NAEP showed no statistically significant decline in 4th grade reading, and 21 of 26 showed no statistically significant decline in 8th grade reading, with one district showing a statistically significant increase. However, the work is far from over. The Department of Education will work with states and districts to make sure that ARP funds are helping students recover academically as quickly as possible and that schools are meeting their needs. New actions the Administration is taking this week to combat learning loss: Reading and Math Convenings: This week the Department announced that, beginning October 26, it will host five sessions focused on strategies and programs to boost literacy and math outcomes. The monthly sessions will highlight strategies and best practices to help states, districts, and schools improve learning outcomes for students, especially in literacy and mathematics. The kickoff event on October 26 will reinforce the President’s call to use ARP funds to combat learning loss. Learning Acceleration Guide: Today, the Department issued an updated guide further re-enforcing the key strategies districts and states should use to address learning loss and academic recovery, with additional resources over the coming weeks. Ongoing actions the Administration is taking to address learning loss and accelerate recovery: Within three months of his presidency, President Biden and congressional Democrats passed the ARP, which provided $130 billion to schools, including $122 billion in ARP Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ARP ESSER) funding to K-12 schools to reopen safely and address the impacts of the pandemic on students, including evidence-based programs to support learning recovery and acceleration. Independent analysis shows that school districts nationwide plan to spend more than $27 billion specifically on academic recovery, including more than $6 billion on summer learning and after-school programs and $3 billion on tutoring and coaching for reading and math; and an additional $30 billion on staffing, including hiring more educators, and providing professional development so that educators know how to best support their students’ recovery. No Republicans voted for the American Rescue Plan or its funds to support safely getting children back into classrooms and to help them recover academically. The Department immediately took action to help schools use ARP funds to help students recover academically, including: Holding multiple school reopening and recovery summits, to bring together national, state, and local leaders to share best practices on how to use ARP funds to safely reopen schools and accelerate learning recovery. Developing a Best Practices Clearinghouse with hundreds of examples of how schools were using ARP funds to support academic and mental health recovery – for school leaders and communities across the country to use. Releasing multiple rounds of guidance on how schools can use ARP funds on core priorities, including safely reopening schools , academic recovery , and mental health support . Developing a Back-to-School Checklist for Parents to help parents and families have conversations with school leaders during back-to-school time and beyond about how schools are supporting students, including by using ARP funds. The Department collaborated across the public and private sectors to help schools use ARP funds to support learning recovery, including: Announcing new efforts with the Department of Labor to expand high-quality teacher preparation programs, such as registered teacher apprenticeship programs, that will provide more students with high quality teachers to help with learning recovery. Collaborating with service organizations to recruit 250,000 new tutors and mentors to help with student recovery. The Department joined AmeriCorps, the Johns Hopkins Everyone Graduates Center, and leading education, youth, and service organizations to launch the National Partnership for Student Success (NPSS) , a new coalition formed to expand high-quality tutoring, mentoring, and other evidence-based support programs, with the goal of ensuring an additional 250,000 adults serve in these roles over the next three years. Partnering with national organizations to expand access to after-school and summer programs to help accelerate academic recovery and address the impacts of the pandemic. In July 2022, the Department, along with five coordinating partners and more than 20 national organizations, launched the Engage Every Student Initiative , designed to help communities utilize ARP funds—alongside their state and local funds—to ensure that every child and youth who wants a spot in a high-quality out-of-school time program, such as after-school and summer programs, has access to one. The Department also launched the Summer Learning and Enrichment Collaborative to make sure students specifically have access to more summer programs to help them recover. The Department also put in place strong requirements to track school reopening and ensure transparency regarding how states and school districts are using American Rescue Plan funds. Tracking status of school reopening and recovery efforts: Prior to the current Administration, there was no federal effort to track the status of school reopening efforts. The Department immediately worked to put in place the NAEP Monthly School Survey in order to track schools’ operating status and the Administration’s progress in fully reopening all schools safely. Building on this survey, the Department launched the School Pulse Panel to track schools’ efforts to provide high-impact supports to students, such as tutoring, after-school and summer programs, mental health supports, and staffing and to better understand the challenges our schools are facing, so that the Administration can better support them. Launching an interactive map to help families see how ARP funds are being used: Unlike previous rounds of relief funding, states and districts are required to create and publicly post plans for using ARP ESSER funds, including how they will address student academic and mental health needs. State and district plans can be accessed through the Department’s interactive map."

18-Oct-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/department-hosts-raising-bar-literacy-math-series-address-academic-recovery,Department Hosts Raising the Bar: Literacy & Math Series to Address Academic Recovery,"As part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s ongoing efforts to support the academic recovery of students from the impact of the pandemic, on Oct. 26, the U.S. Department of Education will host the first of five sessions focused on strategies and programs to boost student literacy and math outcomes. These sessions will highlight strategies and best practices to help states, districts, and schools improve learning outcomes for students especially in literacy and mathematics. The series seeks to build engagement from the field; identify collaboration opportunities among research, practice, and funding; and lift best practices and resources for practitioners and policymakers to take action to address learning loss and academic recovery. “We always knew the pandemic would have a profound impact on students’ learning, which is why the Biden-Harris administration made it a priority from Day One to safely reopen our schools and secure the American Rescue Plan’s $122 billion investment in public education to support students’ recovery,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “From that moment on, our Department has encouraged state and local leaders to spend their American Rescue Plan dollars on evidence-based strategies for ensuring our students can catch up in the classroom. I’m pleased to announce a new expert-led speaker series that will equip educators, school leaders, and district administrators with the latest information on the science of learning and the most promising tools for accelerating academic recovery, so that they can raise the bar to support our students and level up their skills in the critical areas of math and reading.” The sessions will occur monthly from October through February and will center on sustained, cohesive efforts to improve educational practice. The kickoff event on Oct. 26, hosted at the U.S. Department of Education, is a continued call to action to practitioners, education leaders, teachers, parents, students, and policymakers to continue to leverage the extraordinary level of available federal resources to mitigate learning loss and accelerate academic recovery. Additionally, next week the Department will issue a guide to drive strategies in districts and states on how to best address learning loss and academic recovery. This guide will be a follow-up to the extensive guidance provided in the handbooks on reopening and recovery provided by the Department in early 2021. The subsequent four convenings include topics focused on: Learning research-based practices from content experts Highlighting promising practices from SEAs and districts Leveraging ARP funding to implement literacy and math achievement best practices at scale Offering dedicated time and expertise to support action planning (i.e., guided working sessions and support from technical assistance providers). More information on the additional convenings to come. Date Session Topic Session 1 October 26, 2022 Enhancing Awareness of the Best Strategies and Resources Available to Address Learning Loss and Academic Recovery Session 2 November 10, 2022 (Date is subject to change) Best Practices and Research on Rigorous Instruction for all Students in Literacy and Mathematics Session 3 December 8, 2022 (Date is subject to change) Increasing Support for Students Beyond the Classroom Session 4 January 12, 2023 (Date is subject to change) Addressing Educator Shortages and Parent/Family Engagement in Literacy and Mathematics Session 5 February 9, 2023 (Date is subject to change) Highlighting the Best Examples of Putting Policy into Practice The Literacy and Math series is part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to supporting students’ academic recovery and ensuring recovery efforts are meeting student, parent, and family needs. As part of that effort, in January, Secretary Cardona laid out his vision for education in America by boldly addressing opportunity and achievement gaps in education. Through the American Rescue Plan (ARP), the Biden-Harris Administration is investing in evidence-based solutions that are driving academic recovery and providing additional mental health supports. Since education was disrupted in March 2020 due to the global covid-19 pandemic, the Biden-Harris Administration has prioritized recovery for students through multiple efforts. In addition to providing $130 billion in ARP funds for K-12 education to support the safe reopening of K-12 schools and to meet the needs of all students, the Biden-Harris Administration: Awarded nearly $1 billion to 56 states and territories through the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act to help schools in high-need districts provide students with safe and supportive learning opportunities and environments that are critical for their success. Launched the National Partnership for Student Success to recruit 250,000 new tutors, mentors, and other adults in high-impact roles, and support states, school districts and community organizations in establishing high-quality programs. Launched the Engage Every Student Initiative to support summer learning and afterschool programs with ARP funds, alongside other state and local funds . Launched a campaign through the Best Practices Clearinghouse to highlight and celebrate evidence-based and promising practices implemented by states, schools, and school districts using ARP funds to support learning recovery, increased academic opportunities, and student mental health. Launched the National Parents and Families Engagement Council to empower parents and school communities with knowledge about how their schools are using and can use federal funds to provide the necessary academic and mental health supports. Made it easier for families and stakeholders to see how their states and school districts are using ARP funds by requiring State Educational Agencies and Local Educational Agencies to create plans for using ARP Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) funds, engage key stakeholders as they draft their plans, and make those plans accessible to the public through an interactive map. Previous rounds of relief funding did not require these plans."
17-Oct-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/education-department-announces-ohio-and-california-teachers-2022-presidential-cybersecurity-education-awardees,Education Department Announces Ohio and California Teachers as 2022 Presidential Cybersecurity Education Awardees,"Today, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) is announcing the 2022 recipients of the Presidential Cybersecurity Education Award , kicking-off Cybersecurity Career Awareness Week . Benjamin Dougherty, of Lakota West High School in West Chester, Ohio, and Robert “Allen” Stubblefield, Jr., of Troy High School in Fullerton, California, were selected as awardees for instilling in their students the skills, knowledge, and passion for cybersecurity. “Today, we honor two talented and creative educators who are raising the bar for how we prepare students for rewarding careers in the fast-growing field of cybersecurity,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “Educators and instructors nationwide can look to Mr. Dougherty and Mr. Stubblefield as glowing examples of what it takes to inspire passion for cybersecurity in our students and equip them with the academic and technical skills sought out by today’s employers. The Department of Education recognizes that cybersecurity educators are essential to our efforts to build stronger pathways for students into well-paying jobs in a field that’s increasingly vital to our nation's security and prosperity."" The Presidential Cybersecurity Education Award, now in its third year, is presented annually to two teachers selected for their superior accomplishments as educators, academic achievement indicators, and leadership contributing to the field of cybersecurity. The program also helps to create awareness for cybersecurity occupations, for which there are currently more than 700,000 job openings in the U.S. Employment for information security analysts -- just one type of cybersecurity job – is projected to grow much faster than other occupations through 2031. “These educators play a crucial role in preparing our nation’s students for cybersecurity careers, helping ensure that these students are empowered with the education and skills to navigate career pathways into the cybersecurity field,” said National Cyber Director Chris Inglis. “Their expertise and dedication are an inspiration to educators and cyber professionals everywhere as we seek to expand high-quality cybersecurity education, prepare students for good-paying job opportunities, and ensure that our nation’s cyber workforce has the best and brightest – from all backgrounds – contributing to our collective defense.” Dougherty is the inaugural instructor of the Lakota Cyber Academy, where he has connected a highly technical, student-centered curriculum to strong recruitment and retention metrics. His program has grown to 200 students since launching in 2019, and these students have achieved impressive results in national competitions including National Cyber League and CyberStart America. Students in his program are currently employed in work-based learning positions in the banking and aviation sectors, among other industries. Stubblefield is a Cyber Defense educator at Troy High School who served in the U.S. Navy for 21 years before beginning his teaching career. Over the past 12 years, he has coached 486 middle school students in CyberPatriot competitions and 327 elementary students through summer camps. Stubblefield has offered financial and other support to make his program accessible to students from disadvantaged and underrepresented backgrounds. His work with elementary and middle school programs has created a robust watershed of students prepared to enter the high school academic pathway in cybersecurity that he also developed. Dougherty and Stubblefield were formally announced as the 2022 PCE awardees earlier today at the National Initiative for Cybersecurity’s kick-off event for Cybersecurity Career Awareness Week in Washington, DC. They, along with other recent award recipients, will be honored during the 2022 NICE K12 Cybersecurity Education Conference . The Presidential Cybersecurity Education Award is led by the U.S. Department of Education,in consultation with the White House Office of the National Cyber Director and the National Science Foundation."
14-Oct-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/secretary-cardona-announces-educators-and-parent-leader-board-oversee-nations-report-card,Secretary Cardona Announces Educators and a Parent Leader on Board to Oversee the Nation’s Report Card,"WASHINGTON—Today, U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona announced the newest appointments to the National Assessment Governing Board, which oversees the country’s only ongoing, nationally representative assessment of student achievement. The newest board members include a fourth-grade teacher, an eighth-grade teacher, a high school principal, and a parent leader. Former North Carolina Gov. Bev Perdue is also reappointed as Board Chair. The 26-member governing board is responsible for deciding which subjects the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) assesses, determining assessment content, setting achievement levels that describe student performance, and pursuing new ways to make NAEP results useful and meaningful to the public. Although the Board operates independently, the National Assessment of Educational Progress Authorization Act calls for members to be appointed by the U.S. Secretary of Education. “Decisions about how we measure student progress and the future of important tools like the Nation’s Report Card must be informed by the voices of parents, educators, and school leaders,” said Secretary Cardona. “The appointees announced today offer decades of combined experience working directly with students, families, and educators and command tremendous respect in their communities. As we work to help students catch up in the classroom and fully recover from the pandemic, I’m confident that their diverse perspectives will be assets to the National Assessment Governing Board.” “After the disruptions of the pandemic, it is more important than ever to help the public understand whether students are making academic progress. The Governing Board is privileged to welcome these distinguished leaders working with students and families across the country to help shape the future of the Nation’s Report Card,” said Executive Director of the Governing Board Lesley Muldoon.

13-Oct-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-awards-nearly-120-million-over-five-years-support-educators-english-learner-students,U.S. Department of Education Awards Nearly $120 Million Over Five Years to Support Educators of English Learner Students,"The U.S. Department of Education’s Office of English Language Acquisition (OELA) recently announced awards of nearly $120 million over five years under the National Professional Development Program (NPD) to support educators of English learner students. The NPD program provides grants to eligible Institutions of Higher Education and public or private entities with relevant experience and capacity, in consortia with states or districts, to implement professional development activities that will improve instruction for English Learners (ELs). Following the education priorities of the Biden-Harris Administration as stated by Secretary Cardona, these grants align with his call to boldly address opportunity and achievement gaps by investing in, recruiting, and supporting the professional development of a diverse educator workforce, including bilingual educators so education jobs are ones that people from all backgrounds want to pursue. ""I grew up speaking Spanish at home and thrived as an English learner in school thanks to great teachers who helped me realize that my bilingualism and my biculturalism would someday be my superpower,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""As our nation grows more diverse than ever before, we must level up our investments in educators who can provide students from all backgrounds with equitable opportunities to succeed. This $120 million, five-year investment will support high quality professional development and teacher preparation programs across the country. It will also help us grow a pipeline of diverse and talented educators who can help more English learners realize their own bilingual and multilingual superpowers."" These grants can be awarded to educators of ELs including teachers, administrators, paraprofessionals or other educators working with ELs. Professional development activities may include teacher education programs and training that lead to certification, licensing, or endorsement for providing instruction to students learning English. Educator effectiveness is the most important in-school factor affecting student achievement and success. To improve the academic achievement of ELs, the NPD program supports pre-service and in-service instruction for teachers and other staff, including school leaders, working with ELs. Selected applicants submitted proposals to improve access to culturally and linguistically responsive early learning environments for multilingual learners and that increase public awareness about the benefits of proficiency in more than one language. “The NPD grants support the professional growth of the education workforce by promoting the skills and critical dispositions of educators and leaders. These grants can enhance the capacity of the education workforce to create equitable learning environments that promote language, literacy and diversity. This work is vital to increase educator effectiveness in meeting the needs of English learners and their families,” said OELA Acting Director Montserrat Garibay. The NPD program has funded a range of grantees that are currently implementing 182 projects across the country, including the most recent grantees. As the EL population continues to grow, it has become increasingly important to identify and expand the use of evidence-based instructional practices that improve EL learning outcomes. The Department projects this new cohort of 44 grants will serve approximately 1,638 pre-service and 6,271 in-service teachers.

The EAC awards fund four new regional EACs that each provide technical assistance to public schools and other agencies focused on addressing equity in their community for students and the educators who support them related to race, sex, national origin, gender identity, disability, and religion. This funding also supports regional EACs that provide technical assistance and training at the request of school boards and other governmental agencies in the preparation, adoption, and implementation of plans for the desegregation of public schools. Each center provides training and technical assistance, upon request, in the areas of civil rights, equity, and school reform to school systems within a region comprised of 12-15 states. This assistance helps schools and communities ensure that equitable education opportunities are available and accessible for all children. The MSAP awards support efforts to develop and revitalize magnet schools with academically challenging and innovative instructional approaches designed to bring together students from different social, economic, ethnic, and racial backgrounds. These 19 grantees will implement a variety of curricular focus areas in 62 schools offering programming in all five areas of STEAM learning, career development, leadership skills, and language immersion. “Today, we’re investing in schools and communities that have shown a commitment to intentionally serving students and closing opportunity gaps based on race, place, and circumstance in America,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “Every child has something to offer this country, and they deserve access to effective educators, inclusive and supportive learning environments, and innovative, engaging programs that unlock their potential and lead to success. These grant awards will help communities reimagine our schools through a more equitable lens and raise the bar for how we serve students who too often get left behind.” Last January, Secretary Cardona laid out his vision for education in America by boldly addressing opportunity and achievement gaps in education. That vision includes challenging states and districts to fix broken systems that may perpetuate inequities in our schools. When deciding on grantmaking, the Department centralizes it efforts around educational equity, including high-quality educational experiences for all students. This principle continues to guide discretionary grantmaking, especially for programs that support historically underserved communities and students such as reflected in the awards given to EACs and MSAPs.

The BSCA provided historic funding to help meet President Biden’s goal of doubling the number of school-based mental health professionals and tackling the nation’s mental health crisis. This is the first of $1 billion in Bipartisan Safer Communities Act funds over the next five years that the Department of Education will award for this purpose. ""For too long, schools have lacked the resources to hire enough school-based mental health providers, when at the same time, educators are often first to notice when a student is slipping academically or struggling because of mental health challenges,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""We know children and youth can’t do their best learning when they’re experiencing depression, anxiety, and other mental health challenges whether they stem from community violence, social isolation from the pandemic, loss of loved ones, bullying, harassment, or something else. This funding from the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act will help schools raise the bar for student mental health by recruiting, preparing, hiring, and training highly qualified school-based mental health providers, including in underserved communities and for students such as multilingual learners and those from low-income backgrounds and in rural communities, where access to such services can be limited.” The first grant program, School-Based Mental Health Services (SBMH), provides funding to schools to increase the number of credentialed school-based mental health professionals. The second program, the Mental Health Service Professional Demonstration (MHSP) grants, support districts in hiring additional school-based mental health service providers in high-need districts by boosting the mental health profession pipeline. This includes investing in innovative partnerships between school districts and institutions of higher education to prepare qualified school-based mental health services providers for employment in schools. These programs will increase the number of mental health service providers from diverse backgrounds or from the communities they serve, including ensuring access to services for children and youth who are English learners. This announcement is part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to addressing the nation’s mental health crisis by providing more resources and supports to help schools address students’ mental health needs. As part of that effort, in January, Secretary Cardona laid out the department’s goals and vision for helping students recover from the pandemic, including by increasing access to social, emotional, and mental health supports for all students. Just recently, the Department announced the Stronger Connections Grant program, which are awards totaling nearly $1 billion to 56 states and territories through BSCA to help schools in high-need districts provide students with safe and supportive learning opportunities and environments that are critical for their success. At the beginning of the school year, the Department sent a letter with U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Becerra to governors across the country to highlight federal resources available to states and schools to invest in mental health services for students. The Department also awarded $122 billion in ARP Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) funds to help schools reopen and recover, and experts indicate more than $2 billion has been directed to hire more school psychologists, counselors, and other mental health professionals in K-12 schools. With the help of these funds, as of July, compared with the pre-pandemic period, the number of school social workers is up 54% and the number of school counselors is up 22%. Coinciding with this announcement from the Department of Education, today the Department of Health and Human Services is announcing awards of nearly $27 million to improve and expand mental health care for children. This funding will offer timely mental health support to children and adolescents by training pediatricians and other children’s health care providers in treating mental health conditions and by providing tele-consultation to bring mental health expert support directly to pediatric primary care providers. School-Based Mental Health Services Grant Program The SBMH grant program provides competitive grants to State educational agencies (SEAs), Local educational agencies (LEAs), and consortia of LEAs to increase the number of credentialed school-based mental health service providers delivering school-based mental health services to students in LEAs with demonstrated need. The grant provides $144 million each year for 5 years, with an average award size of $1,750,000, ranging from $500,000 to $3,000,000 per year. The Department anticipates making up to 150 awards. Two technical assistance webinars for prospective applicants will be provided: one on October 11th, 2022, and one on October 19th, 2022, prior to the application deadline. Webinar information will be available here. Mental Health Service Professional Demonstration Grant Program The MHSP Demonstration grant program provides competitive grants to support and demonstrate innovative partnerships to train school-based mental health services providers for employment in schools and LEAs. The grant program aims to address a challenge facing districts and schools across the country: an insufficient supply of school-based mental health professionals to meet the needs of students. The partnerships must include (1) one or more high-need LEA or an SEA on behalf of one or more high-need LEA; and (2) one or more eligible institutions of higher education (IHE). These grants make available $143 million a year for 5 years, with an average award size of $800,000, ranging from $400,000 to $1,200,000 per year. The Department anticipates making up to 250 awards. Two technical assistance webinars for prospective applicants will be provided: one on October 12th, 2022, and one on October 18th, 2022, prior to the application deadline. Webinar information will be available here."

OCR determined that the district failed to address harassment of students on the basis of race, color, and national origin, in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its implementing regulations. Peer harassment included race-based slurs, such as targeting the n-word and “ching chong” at students, mocking police killings of Black people, pulling eyes back to mock Asian students, mimicking “Heil Hitler” salutes, drawing Swastikas on photographs of students’ faces on notebooks and in a bathroom, and saying Black people “do not deserve to live” and “should die,” a student’s skin looked like “burnt” food, and that a student should “go back to [their] country” and “eat dog.” Harassment by employees involved repeated touching of and comments exclusively about a Black student’s hair. The persistent, pervasive, and severe harassment and the district’s ineffective response caused significant and enduring academic, social, and emotional harm to the student who was the subject of the OCR complaint. Moreover, OCR found that a schoolwide hostile environment existed because at least a dozen other students of color at the school were likewise harassed based on race, color, or national origin by numerous peers. Although administrators and teachers at the school were aware of widespread harassment, the district repeatedly responded ineffectively, or not at all, to reported harassment, allowing the harassment to continue on a consistent basis and to create a school-level hostile environment. The district also did not offer any supports or remedies to students who were harassed. As a result of these failures, OCR determined that the district permitted students of color to be subjected to a hostile environment based on their race, color, or national origin that was sufficiently severe, persistent, or pervasive that it interfered with – or could have reasonably interfered with – their ability to participate in or benefit from the school’s program. The resolution agreement commits the district to take steps to ensure nondiscrimination based on race, color, and national origin in its education programs and activities. “Every student in every school deserves to learn free from discriminatory harassment,” said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon. “Peoria Unified School District today commits to come into compliance with longstanding federal civil rights requirements, ensuring that district students learn without discrimination based on race or national origin.” The district’s commitments in the voluntary resolution agreement include: Providing supports and remedies, where appropriate, to students who were subjected to peer harassment based on race, color, or national origin at the school. Conducting a climate assessment that examines the prevalence of harassment at the school, the hostile environment created by the widespread harassment, the school’s and district’s handling of reports of harassment, and measures for reducing harassment at the school and for improving the district’s response to reports of harassment. Issuing an anti-harassment statement and issuing a notice to parents about identifying and reporting harassment and about how the district is expected to respond. Reviewing, revising, and disseminating policies, forms, and record-keeping procedures related to harassment based on race, color, and national origin. Training staff about legal requirements under Title VI, reporting and responding to harassment, prohibited retaliation, cultural competency, and implicit bias. And, Providing developmentally appropriate educational programs about how to recognize and report racial harassment for school students. The letter to Peoria Unified School District is available here and the resolution agreement is available here ."

Today, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) released its estimate of the costs of the Biden-Harris Administration's Student Debt Relief. The Department estimates that one-time student debt relief will cost an average of $30 billion a year over the next decade. Student Debt Relief is designed to help borrowers and families most in need as they prepare to resume student loan payments in January 2023. Nearly 90 percent of relief dollars will go to those earning less than $75,000 per year. And, no borrower or household in the top 5% of earners will benefit from this action. Estimated Cost to the Federal Government As a result of Student Debt Relief, millions of borrowers will no longer have to make repayments on their loans and millions more will be able to substantially reduce their repayments. The Department estimates that, over the next 10 years, the program will cost on average $30 billion annually. The ten-year cost in terms of reduced cash flows into the government will be roughly $305 billion. By law, the Department must also estimate the cost of student loan relief over the entire course of the program—in this case more than three decades—not just the next 10 years. That cost is adjusted to present-day dollar values, and then recorded fully in the current fiscal year. The Department's estimate of this total cost in today's dollars is $379 billion. These estimates are based on highly uncertain assumptions about future economic conditions and participation rates. Uncertainty in Participation Rates The Department's estimate assumes that the vast majority of eligible borrowers—81%—will take the necessary steps to get relief. This assumption is very uncertain, as other relief programs skew widely in terms of take-up rates. For example: The Department's debt relief program that provides full debt discharges to borrowers whose schools closed (like ITT Technical Institute and Corinthian Colleges) had just under 50% take-up rate (excluding borrowers that received automatic discharges), based upon a GAO analysis. The take-up rate of another long-standing program, Unemployment Insurance (UI), was roughly 52%. Social Security and Medicare are significant outliers, with take-up rates of 90%. These are 50+ year old programs that are extraordinarily and broadly popular. Uncertainty in Economic Forecasts Student loan cost estimates also rely on other highly uncertain assumptions, including interest rate projections, how quickly borrowers repay their loans, and wage growth projections, among others. Any variation in actual interest rates, wage growth rates, and other economic factors could lead to significant shifts in the costs of the student loan program and other Department programs. The Department's Budget Office maintains a student loan model, which relies on these variables, to produce official estimates of the cost of federal student loan programs. Differences between the Department's estimates and others are largely driven by differences in these base assumptions and assumptions about take-up rates. The Biden-Harris Student Debt Relief plan will help millions of Americans buy homes, save for retirement, or start small businesses by providing critical relief as they recover from the pandemic and manage the too-often overwhelming burden of student loan debt. This estimate does not take into consideration the broader economic benefits those actions would bring, and does not include President Biden's historic record lowering the federal deficit by over $300 billion last year and an expected $1+ trillion dollars this year."

The Stronger Connections grants will help schools provide all students with safe and supportive learning opportunities and environments that are critical for their success. Through the BSCA, and under the leadership of President Biden, Congress provided $1 billion in Title IV, Part A formula funding to state educational agencies (SEAs) to develop state grant programs to provide students with safer and healthier learning environments. Earlier today, Secretary Cardona informed chief state school officers of their allocations under the BSCA Stronger Connections grant program. SEAs must award these funds competitively to high-need local educational agencies (LEAs), as determined by the state, to fund activities allowable under section 4108 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). “We have years of evidence that demonstrate the value of building safe and supportive schools. These efforts improve academic achievement, promote emotional well-being, reduce disciplinary actions, and increase positive behaviors,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “Safe and supportive schools help our children and youth overcome trauma and provide a strong foundation of emotional and physical safety. These grants will provide real benefits to real students in real schools.” Safe and supportive schools are proven by decades of rigorous research to be most effective in supporting academic success as well as meeting the social, emotional, physical, and mental health needs of students. These funds can also be used to support school and community partnerships that pursue multifaceted solutions to more effectively prevent and respond to acts of bullying, violence, and hate that impact members of our school communities at both individual and systemic levels. As part of the Department’s announcement, Secretary Cardona sent chief state school officers a Dear Colleague Letter outlining three principles that SEAs are strongly encouraged to consider when designing a competitive grant competition and providing LEAs with direction for how they use these funds: (1) create positive, inclusive, and supportive school environments; and increase access to place-based interventions and services (2) Engaging students, families, educators, staff, and community organizations in the selection and implementation of strategies and interventions to create safe, inclusive, and supportive learning environments (3) Designing and implementing policies and practices that are responsive to underserved students, protect student rights, and demonstrate respect for student dignity and potential. These policies are consistent with the Administration’s previous position on these issues. Funds can be used to provide all students with safe and supportive learning opportunities and environments that are critical for their success. For example, funds could support the kind of work underway in Saint Paul Public Schools in Minnesota where they are spending almost $13 million in American Rescue Plan (ARP) funds to support the mental health and wellness of students and staff. This approach includes: hiring 32 additional counselors, social workers, and psychologists; partnering with community organizations to offer mental health support for students; training staff on how to handle trauma; and creating calming spaces for staff and students.

28-Sep-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-communicates-vision-advance-digital-equity-all-learners,U.S. Department of Education Communicates Vision to Advance Digital Equity for All Learners,"Today, during the National Digital Equity Summit hosted by the U.S. Department of Education, the Office of Educational Technology (OET) launched Advancing Digital Equity for All: Community-based Recommendations for Developing Effective Digital Equity Plans to Close the Digital Divide and Enable Technology-Empowered Learning . This resource provides recommendations for equitable broadband adoption to support leaders crafting digital equity plans, an aspiration that became an emergency for many schools and families during the pandemic. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law passed earlier this year supports that goal, allocating $2.75 billion under the Digital Equity Act to ensure that all people and communities can reap the full benefits of the digital economy. “Digital equity has never felt more urgent. But our opportunity to deliver digital equity has never felt more within reach. The pandemic turned equitable access to technology from an aspiration into an emergency,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “Students without broadband access or only a cell phone have lower rates of homework completion, lower grade point averages … even lower college completion rates. Today, there can be no equity without digital equity. Thanks to President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we’re making tremendous progress towards that goal.” The National Digital Equity Summit will convene nearly 200 equity-minded organizations, state and local systems leaders, federal agencies, and educational technology experts to discuss how broadband investments from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law can be leveraged to better serve students furthest from digital opportunities and close the digital divide, thereby supporting transformative learning experiences empowered through technology. The summit will be livestreamed and can be viewed here. “The pandemic illuminated long-standing educational equity gaps and spurred an unprecedented period of emergency remote learning. One of the most critical challenges during this time has been providing the foundational access to high-speed, reliable internet necessary to facilitate everywhere, all-the-time learning,” said Assistant Secretary for Planning, Evaluation, and Policy Roberto Rodríguez. “We’ve all understood that digital equity is no longer a ‘nice-to-have’ condition, but a ‘must-have’ to ensure that all may fully participate in the digital economy and society of today and tomorrow.” The new publication also highlights existing barriers across the three components of availability, affordability, and adoption, and provides examples of promising strategies to overcome these barriers. Much of the content was gathered through the Digital Equity Education Roundtables (DEER) Initiative launched by OET in the spring, which progressed national conversations with leaders from community-based organizations, as well as families and students furthest from digital opportunities, to learn more about the barriers faced by learner communities and promising solutions for increasing access to technology. During these events, participants expressed the need to address the three components of digital equity — availability, affordability, and adoption – in order to serve all learners in an equitable manner. Key takeaways from participants are captured in the new Advancing Digital Equity for All resource. The DEER Initiative, today’s summit, and the new resource are examples of the commitment from the Biden-Harris Administration to address connectivity barriers around the country. Also, U.S. Deputy Secretary of Education Cindy Marten recently attended a roundtable discussion in Charlotte, North Carolina, hearing directly from school leaders, community-based organizations, and parents about efforts necessary to boost participation in the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP). Additionally, the Department engaged in a back-to-school campaign to promote ACP enrollment, contributed to interagency efforts in streamlining information about federal broadband funding, and published a series of resources to ensure students’ access from home. Over the next year, OET will build on this progress by fostering a sense of urgency around adoption barriers that impede digital equity in education and cultivating a community of champions who are implementing solutions.

New investments under the Supporting Effective Educator Development (SEED) program, include 22 new three-year grants totaling more than $60 million, bringing the Biden-Harris Administration’s additional support for teachers through Fiscal Year 2022 grant competitions to more than $285 million. “We are treating our efforts to recruit, prepare, and retain a talented and diverse educator workforce with the same level of urgency we brought to reopening our schools during the height of the pandemic,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “Now more than ever, we are supporting teacher preparation and development programs that provide educators with meaningful, relevant, and evidence-based strategies for promoting student success and social and emotional well-being. Today’s investment of over $60 million will support high-quality programs across the country that are truly raising the bar for professional development and embracing evidence-based and innovative and promising approaches, like Grow-Your-Own programs, to strengthen the teacher pipeline today, and in the years ahead.” The SEED program supports evidence-based practices that prioritizes educators’ growth across the continuum of their careers. In this year’s SEED competition, the Department directed funding to projects designed to support educator workforce through high-quality, comprehensive teacher preparation programs, including those with a strong track record of recruiting and placing underrepresented teacher candidates, and that include one year of high-quality clinical experiences. The Department also prioritized projects designed to help teachers create inclusive and equitable learning designed to meet students’ social, emotional, and academic needs. The National Center for Education Statistics’ (NCES) latest survey results on public school experiences with COVID-19 show that, as of August 2022, 53 percent of all public schools reported feeling understaffed entering the 2022-23 school year, and 69 percent reported too few candidates as the biggest challenge to hiring teachers. By investing in programs like SEED and focusing on the most pressing needs, the Biden-Harris Administration is helping to strengthen the teacher pipeline and provide long-term investments in the teaching profession. Supporting Effective Educator Development (SEED) grant awardees include NATIONAL The National Center for Teacher Residencies’ (NCTR) Centering Equity, Building & Scaling Teacher Residencies project aims to increase the number of effective teacher residents from diverse backgrounds in underserved schools, districts, and subjects by boosting teacher residency programs across Connecticut, Delaware, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. NCTR will provide scaffolded technical assistance and support to develop and scale 14 teacher residency programs, 10 of which are located at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). LOUISIANA: The New Orleans SEED program aims to address New Orleans’ persistent teacher shortage problem by focusing on boosting pathways into the profession through the expansion of innovative and promising Grow-Your-Own pathways. Funding will help project partners build a robust, sustainable pipeline of local aspiring teachers to pursue the profession and become the next generation of effective educators in New Orleans’ underserved schools. By 2025, the project hopes to recruit, prepare, and place 550 teachers in underserved schools and have more than 200 high school students in the city’s teacher pipeline. MISSOURI: The Community Training and Assistance Center, Inc., a national non-profit organization, is using SEED support for Project Extended Impact (IMPACT) in partnership with the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. IMPACT aims to increase Missouri’s supply of highly effective principals to improve teaching and learning, engaging 2,100 principals from across the state.

23-Sep-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-launches-1-million-future-finder-challenge-reimagine-career-navigation-adult-learners,U.S. Department of Education Launches $1 Million Future Finder Challenge to Reimagine Career Navigation for Adult Learners,"Today, in recognition of National Adult Education and Family Literacy Week, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) is proud to launch Stage 1 of the Future Finder Challenge , a $1 million challenge to reimagine career navigation for adult learners. The Department's Office of Career, Technical, and Adult Education (OCTAE) invites innovators to build digital tools that better support adult learners as they launch and advance their careers. There are an estimated 43 million American adults who could benefit from adult education. With the workforce and its requirements rapidly shifting, qualifications and skills are no longer enough to thrive in this dynamic landscape. Career navigation tools — which help people understand, choose, and prepare for career opportunities — have become vital to career success. Yet most digital career navigation tools today are not designed for adult learners, leaving too many without the support they need to enter and thrive in high-quality, in-demand occupations and high-growth industries. When adult learners thrive, employers gain access to diverse, skilled talent pools — and their communities prosper. ""Too many working people have been unable to gain entry into today's fast-growing fields because our adult education programs have not kept up with the pace of technological change in our economy,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""To build a more equitable and inclusive economy we must raise the bar for adult education in the United States and give learners of all ages the tools and opportunities they need to level up their skills and climb the economic ladder. Our Future Finder Challenge is about encouraging innovation and the creation of tools that help adult learners better navigate the workforce and take advantage of career opportunities in today's most in-demand fields."" ""Developing digital career navigation tools for adult learners will expand equitable access to career opportunities — which will increase upward mobility and strengthen the broader American workforce,"" said Assistant Secretary for the Office of Career, Technical, and Adult Education Amy Loyd, Ed.L.D. ""Through the Future Finder Challenge, we're using open innovation to invest in the adult edtech ecosystem, driving greater collaboration between adult learners and developers, educators, and employers."" The Future Finder Challenge builds upon the Department's history of successful open innovation initiatives to spur the development of services, products, and programs to better support learners of all ages. Open innovation can uniquely stimulate untapped markets and propel needed innovation by offering no-strings-attached funding alongside exclusive access to key resources and collaboration opportunities. In addition to monetary awards, the challenge will provide guidance around topics such as user-centered design, data collection and evaluation, and sustainability planning to help innovators pave the way. Through the Future Finder Challenge, the Department is bringing together adult education providers, edtech companies, and employers to encourage collaboration and information sharing. Eligible participants, including teams of strategists, app developers, user-centered designers, and educators are invited to submit prototypes for digital tools by 6:00 p.m. ET on December 15, 2022. The online submission should outline how the proposed digital tool will be designed to improve adult learners' career navigation outcomes, such as increased self-awareness, career knowledge, confidence, and/or job attainment in high-quality, in-demand occupations and high-growth industries. Participants should further describe how their tools will integrate with existing career navigation systems, including by complementing in-person services, as well as how they plan to collect and share usage, user, and outcomes data. To learn more, participants are encouraged to register for the virtual information session on October 13, 2022 and explore challenge resources at FutureFinderChallenge.com . An independent judging panel will recommend up to five finalists to receive at least $50,000 each and progress into Stage 2, which will run from spring to fall 2023. During the second stage, finalists will participate in a virtual accelerator, receiving exclusive access to virtual resources, mentorship from experts, and other support to help them build and test their tools. The accelerator will kick off with an in-person boot camp and culminate in a live demo day. The Stage 2 judging panel will review the submitted proposals and recommend one grand-prize winner to receive $500,000 and up to two runners-up to receive a share of at least $250,000. The Future Finder Challenge will support winners into 2024 as they deploy their solutions across the adult ed ecosystem.

21-Sep-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/education-department-awards-177-million-new-grants-increase-competitive-employment-people-disabilities,Education Department Awards $177 Million in New Grants to Increase Competitive Integrated Employment for People with Disabilities,"Today, the U.S. Department of Education’s Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) announced new five-year grant awards for the Subminimum Wage to Competitive Integrated Employment ( SWTCIE ) demonstration project to 14 state vocational rehabilitation (VR) agencies. The purpose of these grants is to decrease the use of subminimum wages and increase access to competitive integrated employment for people with disabilities. These VR agencies will receive funding from the Disability Innovation Fund ( DIF ) to support increasing access for people with disabilities to jobs that pay good wages. “President Biden always says that a good-paying job is about more than a paycheck, it’s about dignity, and that’s why we can no longer accept a status quo in which so many individuals with disabilities are segregated from the workforce and relegated into poverty-wage jobs that offer no pathway to higher earnings,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “Our Real Pay for Real Jobs Initiative is about building a more equitable, inclusive workforce that thrives on the talents of Americans of all abilities. These grants will support innovative efforts underway across the country to provide educational opportunities to youth and adults with disabilities so they can secure better-paying jobs, build economic security, and lead more fulfilling, independent lives.” This grant program advances a key Biden-Harris Administration goal of strengthening the economic security of Americans with disabilities. These grants align existing and emerging employment opportunities with the needs of employers and our nation’s public infrastructure. Using innovative approaches, state vocational rehabilitation agencies will assist job seekers with disabilities to secure high-quality jobs for real pay in the areas of green jobs, essential worker industries, the transportation industry, and the arts in which they will work alongside their non-disabled peers at comparable wages. Each project embraces collaborative efforts among multiple partners and stakeholders, including state and local providers, public and private employers, and advocates. “Far too many people with disabilities would like to work but are living in poverty because they have not had the opportunity to find a career in a competitive integrated employment. Further, too many continue to work under a discriminatory exception to the Fair Labor Standards Act that permits workers with disabilities to be paid less than the minimum wage,” said Chairman Robert C. “Bobby” Scott, House Committee on Education and Labor. “This historic investment in support of innovative activities aimed at increasing competitive integrated employment will help ensure that people with disabilities have meaningful opportunities not only to work but to thrive in their communities.” “Every worker with a disability deserves to be paid fairly for their work and deserves the opportunity to find a good-paying job that allows them to build for their future and thrive,” said Senator Murray, Chair of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP). “These grants are a big step forward to connect Americans with disabilities with quality jobs and help end the truly backward practice of paying workers subminimum wages simply because they have a disability.” This grant program expands on the Biden Administration’s continued dedication towards programs that support individuals with disabilities to prepare for and achieve competitive integrated employment. RSA administers formula and discretionary grant programs that develop and implement comprehensive systems of vocational rehabilitation, support employment, and create independent living services for older individuals who are blind through the provision of services, training, and advocacy to maximize the employment, independence, and integration of individuals with disabilities in their communities. In FY 2022, these programs were funded at nearly $3.8 billion and served over 1,500,000 individuals with disabilities across the United States. “Individuals with disabilities who are served by the SWTCIE grantees will be able to enjoy the four principles of the Americans with Disabilities Act: equality of opportunity; full participation; independent living; and economic self-sufficiency,” said Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services Deputy Assistant Secretary Katy Neas.

Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee, and Coppin State University in Baltimore, Maryland were awarded over $60,000 and $130,000 in Project SERV grants respectively. Coppin State University (CSU) will use its Project SERV funds to hire a full-time counseling psychologist, who will provide both individual and group counseling services. The funds will also go toward response training for all students, staff, and faculty as well as resources to cope with the stress and the anxiety that such events can trigger. Fisk University will use its Project SERV funds to boost campus safety, including security guard resources and equipment. Fisk will also use its funds for student services, such as a forum providing students with resources and information on how to cope with stress and anxiety, a workshop on how to respond after a crisis or trauma, in addition to other services needed to restore confidence and reduce anxiety among students. Additional institutions that have also been awarded Project SERV grants include; Tougaloo College, Fayetteville State University, and Southern University Law Center. The Department expects additional grants to be awarded in the coming weeks and continues to work with additional HBCUs impacted to support them in the grant application process and in expediting applications once received. At this week’s 2022 National HBCU Week Conference, the Department and its partners are also providing technical assistance on Project SERV applications and sharing best practices through workshops and networking opportunities. “We’re pleased that these institutions have been able to receive the aid they deserve to ensure the well-being and safety of their students, staff, and faculty, said Dietra Trent, Executive Director of the White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence and Economic Opportunity through Historically Black Colleges and Universities. “The Biden-Harris Administration is here to support our HBCU community, and we will continue working to promote policies and practices that fortify their strength and advance educational equity, excellence, and economic opportunity through these institutions.” Project SERV provides short-term funding for local educational agencies and institutions of higher education that have experienced a violent or traumatic incident to assist in restoring a safe environment conducive to learning. The Biden-Harris Administration continues to take a whole-of-government approach to support HBCU campuses. The Administration has delivered nearly $6 billion in cumulative investments to HBCUs, including: $3.7 billion through the American Rescue Plan and other COVID relief; $1.6 billion in capital finance debt relief; and $500 million in grant funding to help HBCUs and other MSIs expand capacity."

During the conference, the HBCU community will engage with key leaders, including members of President Biden’s Cabinet, federal agency officials, private sector executives, and financial aid experts. The Department of Education and its partners will also provide technical assistance for HBCUs on Project SERV applications and share best practices through workshops and networking opportunities. In response to President Biden's Executive Order 14041, federal agencies were charged with evaluating opportunities to increase coordination, communication, and engagement with HBCUs. This year’s conference will focus on program opportunities from many of those federal partners . There also will be a hybrid career fair, which will include 126 employers, representing public and private sectors. The Biden-Harris Administration continues to take a whole-of-government approach to support the well-being of students, families, staff and faculty at HBCU campuses.

16-Sep-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-announces-2022-national-blue-ribbon-schools,U.S. Department of Education Announces 2022 National Blue Ribbon Schools,"U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona today recognized 297 schools as National Blue Ribbon Schools for 2022. The recognition is based on a school's overall academic performance or progress in closing achievement gaps among student subgroups. Secretary Cardona made the announcement during his Road to Success Back to School bus tour. ""I applaud all the honorees for the 2022 National Blue Ribbon Schools Award for creating vibrant, welcoming, and affirming school communities where students can learn, grow, reach their potential, and achieve their dreams,"" said Secretary Cardona. ""As our country continues to recover from the pandemic, we know that our future will only be as strong as the education we provide to all of our children. Blue Ribbon Schools have gone above and beyond to keep students healthy and safe while meeting their academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs. These schools show what is possible to make an enduring, positive difference in students' lives."" With its 39th cohort, the National Blue Ribbon Schools Program has bestowed approximately 10,000 awards to more than 9,000 schools. The National Blue Ribbon School award affirms and validates the hard work of students, educators, families, and communities in striving for – and attaining – exemplary achievement. National Blue Ribbon Schools serve as models of effective school practices for state and district educators and other schools throughout the nation. A National Blue Ribbon School flag gracing a school's entryway or on a flagpole is a widely recognized symbol of exemplary teaching and learning. The Department recognizes all schools in one of two performance categories, based on all student scores, subgroup student scores and graduation rates: Exemplary High-Performing Schools are among their state's highest performing schools as measured by state assessments or nationally normed tests. Exemplary Achievement Gap-Closing Schools are among their state's highest performing schools in closing achievement gaps between a school's student groups and all students. Up to 420 schools may be nominated each year. The Department invites nominations for the National Blue Ribbon Schools award from the top education official in all states, the District of Columbia, U.S. territories, the Department of Defense Education Activity, and the Bureau of Indian Education. Private schools are nominated by the Council for American Private Education.

As the 2022-23 school year begins, and to help drive academic recovery, the Department is redoubling its commitment to providing states and communities with additional resources to support student learning and parental and family engagement. These SFEC grants will provide financial support to organizations that offer technical assistance and training to state educational agencies and school districts that effectively engage families over policies, programs, and activities that lead to improvements in student development and academic achievement. “Congratulations to these new grantees on their work to advance innovative approaches that promote strong parent and family engagement for the academic success of all students,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “The voices of parents and families have never been more critical to the success of our education system. Parents are our children’s first and most influential teachers. We have an enduring commitment to parent and family engagement in all our work at the U.S. Department of Education. These new grantees exemplify the efforts we want to see across the country to improve our parent and family engagement.” Today’s announcement comes while Secretary Cardona is participating in the Road to Success Bus Tour, a week-long, multi-state road trip that will show the many ways school communities are helping students recover and thrive – putting them on the road to success. On his stops today, he will be visiting a community school in Pennsylvania and will speak with parents about their role in supporting the academic success of their students. The Biden-Harris Administration remains committed to elevating parent voices in education. Last month, the Department released a parent back-to-school checklist. The checklist helps parents, caregivers, and families engage with local school and district leaders about how they are supporting students as they recover from the impacts of the pandemic. This checklist elevates key evidence-based practices for supporting students’ learning and mental health, and ensuring the safety of students and staff, which districts are encouraged to implement using American Rescue Plan (ARP) and other COVID relief funds. Through the ARP, the Biden-Harris Administration provided states and school districts with $130 billion to help students recover, succeed, and thrive. Earlier this year, the Department launched the National Parents and Families Engagement Council to facilitate strong and effective relationships between schools and parents, families and caregivers Today’s announcement reflects this year’s SFEC competition priorities, which emphasize addressing the impact of COVID and academic recovery, using cross agency partnerships to better coordinate support for children, and promoting equity in student access to education resources and opportunities. The SFEC grants will help position these states to develop resources and other supports to foster parental and family involvement in the academic setting. These grants will enhance statewide collaborations and communication to further the commitment by all for the success of our children. Statewide organizations or consortia in partnership with at least one State Education Agency, applied for these grants. More information about the SFEC program is here .

15-Sep-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-awards-project-serv-grants-tougaloo-college-and-fayetteville-state-university,U.S. Department of Education Awards Project SERV Grants to Tougaloo College and Fayetteville State University,"Today, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) announced Project School Emergency Response to Violence (Project SERV) grants to two HBCUs following the recent spate of bomb threats. Tougaloo College in Jackson, Mississippi, and Fayetteville State University in Fayetteville, North Carolina, were awarded over $420,000 and $80,000 in Project SERV grants respectively. These universities will use the funds to support student trauma recovery related to these threats by hiring full-time equivalent Trauma Specialists/Counselors, increasing full time Security Officer coverage, and offering additional mental health supports. The Department awarded Southern Law University Law Center a $133,000 Project SERV grant last month and expects additional grants to be awarded in the coming weeks. “As Secretary of Education, I want to make it abundantly clear that the Biden-Harris Administration will not tolerate bomb threats or any efforts to terrorize students of color and everyone who lives, works, and studies at our Historically Black Colleges and Universities. The bomb threats made against HBCUs earlier this year not only strained institutions’ resources by prompting costly campus lockdowns, class cancellations, and law enforcement activities, but shattered students’ sense of safety and heightened anxiety throughout these campus communities,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “That is why earlier this year I announced that HBCUs impacted by these disturbing bomb threats would be eligible to apply for funds through our Project SERV program. We will continue to work with our partners across the Administration—using a whole-of-government approach—to make sure HBCU leaders have access to all available federal resources to respond to threats of violence, shore up campus security, expand their infrastructure and capacity, and provide students with the safe and nurturing learning environments that HBCUs are known for.” Tougaloo College and Fayetteville State University are among the more than 50 HBCUs and Historically Black Institutions across the country that have experienced racially motivated bomb threats this year. Project SERV provides short-term funding for local educational agencies and institutions of higher education that have experienced a violent or traumatic incident to assist in restoring a safe environment conducive to learning. In March, Vice President Harris and Secretary Cardona announced that HBCUs impacted by bomb threats would be eligible for Project SERV grants. The Department has been and continues to work with additional HBCUs impacted to support them in the grant application process and is working to expedite applications to get funds to grantees as soon as possible. The Department also provided HBCUs with a compendium of resources that are available across the federal government. These resources can support long-term improvements to campus mental health programs, campus safety and emergency management planning and response. The Biden-Harris Administration continues to take a whole-of-government approach to ensure the safety and well-being of students, staff and faculty to address these repeated threats to HBCU campuses. To date, the Administration has delivered nearly $6 billion in cumulative investments to HBCUs, including: $3.7 billion through the American Rescue Plan and other COVID relief; $1.6 billion in capital finance debt relief; and $500 million in grant funding to help HBCUs and other MSIs expand capacity. Most recently, the Department partnered with the Department of Homeland Security and the Louisiana State University National Center for Biomedical Research and Training/Academy of Counter-Terrorist Education to deliver “ Campus Emergency ” trainings to over 60 HBCUs across the country. Each customized training was held at an HBCU and was crafted for campus law enforcement and related public safety officials involved in planning for, responding to, and recovering from emergencies on their individual campuses. Campus law enforcement and public safety officials are encouraged to participate in the upcoming 2022 National HBCU Week Conference where the Department and its partners will provide technical assistance on Project SERV applications, and share best practices through workshops and networking opportunities."

Even before the pandemic, rates of depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts among youth were on the rise. The pandemic exacerbated those issues, disrupting learning, relationships, and routines and increasing isolation among our nation's youth. Recognizing the scale of this crisis, President Biden put forward a comprehensive national strategy to strengthen mental health. Today, during U.S. Secretary Miguel Cardona’s Road to Success Bus Tour, a week-long, multi-state road trip, he will visit West Virginia University, where they increased their mental health supports for students and faculty using American Rescue Plan (ARP) dollars. Secretary Cardona will also use this time to announce that the Department will be releasing $5,753,732 to the state of West Virginia through the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act for supporting safer and healthier learning environments for K-12 students, including through increased school-based mental health support. The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act provided historic funding to support students, including $1 billion for creating safer and healthier learning environments, and another $1 billion to increase the number of school-based health professionals. Today’s announcement builds on the resources and strategies for states and schools offered by the Department to address mental health needs. In January, Secretary Cardona laid out his vision for continued recovery including by increasing access to social, emotional, and mental health supports for all students. Additionally, the Secretary featured mental health supports for students as a pillar of his back-to-school bus tour. To help students thrive, the Department has: Begun the process of awarding the first of almost $300 million from the FY2022 bipartisan omnibus legislation and the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act to expand access to mental health services in schools. The Department has begun the process of disbursing almost $300 million Congress appropriated in FY22 through both the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act and the FY22 Omnibus to help schools hire more school-based mental health professionals, build a strong pipeline into the profession for the upcoming school year, and increase the diversity of the profession. In total, the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act will invest an additional $1 billion over the next five years in mental health supports in our schools, making progress towards the President's goal to double the number of school counselors, social workers, and other mental health professionals. Sent a letter to governors across the country with U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Becerra to highlight federal resources available to states and schools to invest in mental health services for students. The joint letter from Secretaries Becerra and Cardona highlights actions by the Biden-Harris Administration to improve the delivery of health care in schools and make sure children enrolled in Medicaid have access to comprehensive health care services, as required by law. The letter also previews forthcoming Medicaid guidance on how states can leverage Medicaid funding to deliver critical mental health care services to more students, including ways to make it easier to bill Medicaid for these services. Awarded $122 billion in ARP Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) funds, and experts indicate more than $2 billion is paying for more school psychologists, counselors, and other mental health professionals in K-12 schools. Some examples include: West Virginia’s Monongalia County Schools used ARP funds to strengthen Student Support Teams with school counselors, psychologists, outreach facilitators and nurses. Adding these positions have helped to break barriers in the school-family connection to support overall student success. District data has shown an increase in students who have identified supportive relationships at school as well as an increase in students showing improved Emotional Regulation and Self-Management since spring 2021. Oklahoma State Department of Education (OSDE) will use ARP ESSER funding to hire new school counselors, mental health professionals, and recreational therapists due to an identified shortage in the state. OSDE has awarded grants for 222 school counselors, 94 licensed mental health professionals, and 42 contracts for services. Hosted a webinar to encourage the use of ARP funds to address the state and local school staff labor shortage, including mental health-based professionals, especially as the nation is seeing a rise in the youth mental health crisis, and how those funds can be most effectively used."
13-Sep-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-disperses-funds-support-parents-children-disabilities,U.S. Department of Education Disperses Funds to Support Parents of Children with Disabilities,"Today, the U.S. Department of Education is announcing an additional $2.5 million investment to centers that serve a critical role for parents and families of students with disabilities across the nation. These supplemental grants to Parent Training and Information Centers (PTIs) ensure that all families have the information and training they need to participate effectively in helping their children and navigating the special education system. Two additional grants have been awarded to new Community Parent Resource Centers (CPRCs) in Arkansas and New York. These programs are part of the national network of 27 existing CPRCs and 65 PTIs. With the goal of supporting parents of the more than 7 million children with disabilities of all ages, from birth through age 26, parent center programs began as a single experimental center more than 45 years ago and have grown into a robust technical assistance program that directs more than $30 million in fiscal year 2023 across the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the US territories. ""Parents are critical partners in our school communities, "" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""With these new grant funds, the Department of Education is continuing our strong support of the essential partnership between parents of students with disabilities and local schools. Parents, families, and caregivers must be equipped with the quality information they need to advocate for their child and deeply engage in their child’s education. That is truer now more than ever, especially as we know the pandemic impacted students with disabilities in profound ways. These funds will help to ensure students with disabilities are on the road to success. "" Today’s announcement comes while Secretary Cardona is participating in the Road to Success Bus Tour, a week-long, multi-state road trip that will show the many ways school communities are helping students recover and thrive – putting them on the road to success. On his stops today, he will be visiting a school in Virginia that has prioritized creating a culture of inclusion for all students with disabilities. During the pandemic, parent centers connected with families of children with disabilities over 1.8 million times. These connections resulted in more parents and families of children with disabilities having the knowledge and information needed to support their children and access the resources needed to meet their academic, social, emotional, behavioral, and mental health needs, throughout the pandemic and recovery. PTIs exist in every state and provide training and information to parents of children with disabilities, particularly underserved parents, and parents of children who may be inappropriately identified. CPRCs are operated by local parent organizations and help ensure underserved parents of children with disabilities, including low-income parents, parents of children who are English learners, and parents with disabilities, have the training and information they need to enable them to participate effectively in helping their children. The Biden-Harris Administration continues its dedication to ensuring that every child in America’s schools has the opportunity to be successful. Part of that commitment is ensuring that states, districts, and schools have the resources they need to effectively support the students and families they serve. This administration has also demonstrated its commitment to meeting the diverse needs of children with disabilities nationwide with a historic request of $18.1 billion for Special Education, increasing regular annual funding for IDEA programs by $4.1 billion over a fiscal year 2022 annualized continuing resolution (CR) based on the fiscal year 2021 appropriation, with investments in state formula grants, personnel development grants, technical assistance, and parent resources.

This year’s investment includes 22 new five-year grants totaling $24.8 million through its TQP program. The award recipients represent IHEs and national nonprofits, including three HBCUs and one MSI. ""At the U.S. Department of Education, we recognize the value of supporting our nation’s educators, and we have a responsibility to providing resources and opportunities that promote a diverse educator workforce,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""These programs help prepare, place, develop, and retain effective teachers and leaders in our schools and classrooms. Our students need quality educators now more than ever to address their academic and mental health needs."" Today’s announcement builds on the recent White House meeting on addressing school staffing shortages, and comes as Secretary Cardona, joined by the First Lady Jill Biden, will meet with teachers and teachers-in-training who are participating in leading teacher pipeline programs in Tennessee and North Carolina. This marks the first day of the Department’s Road to Success Bus Tour, a week-long, multi-state road trip that showcases the many ways school communities are helping students recover and thrive – putting them on the road to success. The TQP program funds teacher preparation programs in high-need communities at colleges and universities for the undergraduate, “fifth-year” level, and for teaching residency programs for individuals new to teaching with strong academic and professional backgrounds. The central feature of all TQP grantees is a strong partnership between the teacher preparation program and the school districts they serve, which is often facilitated by mentor teachers that coach and prepare incoming educators. Additionally, the Department included in this year’s competition a Leadership Program priority which will provide an opportunity for applicants to add effective school leadership programs that will prepare individuals enrolled or preparing to enroll in those programs for careers as superintendents, principals, early childhood education program directors, or other school leaders (including individuals preparing to work in rural school communities who may perform multiple duties in addition to the role of a school leader). In addition, numerous awardees responded to an invitational priority, focused on the establishment of Grow Your Own Programs. These programs encourage members of the community to pursue teaching careers while also enhancing educator diversity, reflecting the Department’s interest in learning from applicants proposing Grow Your Own (GYO) projects. This announcement demonstrates the Biden-Harris Administration’s ongoing commitment to building a strong and diverse educator workforce. Just last month, Secretary Cardona, alongside First Lady Jill Biden, U.S. Department of Labor Secretary Marty Walsh, and Ambassador Susan Rice met with teacher unions and partner organizations to discussing the staffing challenges schools are facing. The Department also issued a joint letter with the U.S. Department of Labor to state and local education and workforce leaders encouraging them to take a series of actions to address teacher and school staff shortages and invest in the teaching profession.

The Title II, Part A program provides more than $2 billion annually to states and districts to improve the quality and effectiveness of their teachers, principals, and other school leaders. The 2020-2021 report compiles results from surveys of all states and a representative sample of districts. Key findings from this year’s report: Professional development was the most popular use of Title II, Part A funds by school districts. Eighty percent of districts reported funding professional development, representing 57 percent of all district-level funds. The next most common use of funds was for activities to recruit and retain effective educators (34 percent of districts, and 17 percent of total funds). States spent a larger share of their Title II-A funds on recruiting, hiring, and retaining effective educators in 2020-2021 than in 2019-2020. They also spent more program funds than in previous years on Internet-based professional development and less on attendance at professional conferences. Title II, Part A program funds that remain with state agencies for state-level use were most often spent on program administration, monitoring, and technical assistance. Forty-nine states used funds for these activities, representing 35 percent of all state-level funds.

When President Biden took office, less than half of K-12 schools were open for in-person learning. Within three months, President Biden had signed the historic American Rescue Plan (ARP), providing $170 billion in funds for K-12 schools, colleges, and universities to reopen safely, stay open, and put students on the pathway to recovery and success. Over the last year and a half, schools have invested billions of ARP dollars to help students catch up academically, expand access to mental health supports, and hire more high-quality educators, and today, nearly all schools are safely open for in-person learning. An independent analysis shows that, nationally, by 2024, K-12 schools will have spent more than $27 billion in vital funds on academic recovery and an additional nearly $30 billion on staffing, including recruiting, hiring and retaining critical staff like teachers, academic interventionists and counselors. To support schools, students, educators, and families prepare for the 2022-2023 school year, the Department of Education updated its back-to-school resource site, and released a back-to-school checklist to help parents, caregivers, and families engage with their school district about how ARP funds are helping their students recover and thrive. The Biden-Harris Administration also recently launched efforts to expand access to effective academic and mental health supports in K-12 schools this year, including: Launching the National Partnership for Student Success to recruit 250,000 new tutors and mentors to help catch up academically and thrive. Launching the Engage Every Student Initiative to help communities use ARP funds, alongside other state and local funds, to ensure that every child who wants a spot in a high-quality out-of-school time program has one, whether through a high-quality summer or afterschool program. Announcing the first of nearly $2 billion the President secured through the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act and the FY22 Omnibus to help schools hire more school-based mental health professionals. This fall, the Department will begin the process of disbursing almost $300 million Congress appropriated in FY22 for these efforts. To support college students, working families, and borrowers as they recover from the pandemic, President Biden recently announced his Administration’s plan to provide student loan relief to millions of borrowers and make the student loan system more manageable for working families. The Administration’s actions that will be highlighted on the bus tour include: How American Rescue Plan funds have allowed college students to remain enrolled amidst the economic challenges brought on by the pandemic. How the Biden Administration’s temporary changes to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness is allowing teachers, faculty, and staff get their student loan debts forgiven after 10 years of service . Public servants should apply by Oct. 31, 2022, to take advantage of the temporary changes. For more information, visit PSLF.gov. Raising awareness about President Biden’s announcement of his Administration’s plan to provide debt relief to millions of working and middle-class borrowers .

The ANE program recognizes the important roles that Alaska Native languages and cultures play in the educational success and long-term well-being of Alaska Native students. ANE grants were made to Alaska Native Organizations and entities in Alaska governed predominately by Alaska Natives. These grants support innovative projects that recognize and address the unique educational needs of Alaska Native children and adults. This year’s projects include critical activities for successful school communities. The newly funded projects align with Secretary Cardona’s priorities and will help ensure an equitable recovery so all students can thrive. “I am excited to announce 28 new Alaska Native Education program projects, which will help better meet the needs of Alaska Native students at this critical moment and continue to strengthen the relationship between the Department and Alaska Native Organizations,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “Every Alaska Native student—in rural and remote villages, in regional hubs, and in urban centers—should have access to high-quality and culturally responsive educational opportunities. These projects help fulfill that obligation by supporting existing partnerships between students, families, schools, and Alaska Native Organizations.” Grantees under the ANE program use their funds for such activities as the development of curricula and education programs that address the education needs of Alaska Native students, and the development and operation of student enrichment programs in science and mathematics. Eligible activities also include training and professional development for educators, early childhood and parent outreach, and enrichment programs. Under the American Rescue Plan (ARP) Alaska Native Organizations and entities located in Alaska that are governed predominately by Alaska Natives received $85 million to support innovative projects that recognize and address the unique educational needs of Alaska Native children and adults. To ensure projects funded by the ARP and the new ANE program projects announced today are well supported, the U.S. Department of Education recently conducted Tribal Consultation asking for input on how, among other topics, the ANE program office can meaningfully improve reporting procedures, technical assistance, and peer reviewer recruitment. The input provided will be acted upon immediately, helping to ensure reporting burden is reduced and additional peer-to-peer learning opportunities are more readily available. “I am proud to announce that 20 entities, including Alaska Native tribes and Native organizations, and Alaska Native-led schools and non-profits have received a total of 28 Alaska Native Educational Equity Program (ANEP) grants this year. I have long been a strong advocate for this program because these funds address many needs throughout Alaska, including academic and postsecondary success, language preservation, culturally relevant curriculum development, and teacher professional development in ways that maximize Native ways of knowing and learning,” said U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski. “Alaska’s Native educators and leaders have a proven track record of providing culturally relevant supportive services that enable Alaska Native youth and adults to succeed academically, professionally, and personally. I am grateful to the many Alaska Native educators and tribal leaders who are committed to advancing the success of Alaska Native youth through the many innovative projects these grants will fund.” More information about the ANE program can be found at here .

1-Sep-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/statement-us-secretary-education-miguel-cardona-recent-naep-data,Statement by U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona on Recent NAEP Data,"When President Biden took office, most schools in America remained closed. President Biden got to work. He put teachers at the front of the vaccine line and got Congress to provide aid to improve ventilation and spacing in schools. This plan produced results: a few weeks after President Biden put these measures in place, a majority of schools were open for the first time since the pandemic started. Below is a statement and opinion piece from Secretary Cardona on the recent National Assessment of Educational Progress results. Statement from Secretary Cardona: ""Today’s data confirm the significant impact the prior Administration’s mismanagement of the pandemic has had on our children’s progress and academic wellbeing. That’s why President Biden, from Day One of his Administration, pushed so hard to get schools reopened and students back into classrooms. In less than six months, our nation’s schools went from 46% being open to nearly all being open full-time in-person. That did not happen by accident: The President fought to get teachers eligible for vaccination early on so they could safely open their classrooms. He fought for the American Rescue Plan, which included $130 billion so schools could stay open and students could get the academic and mental health support they need. Our top priority remains to make sure states, schools, and districts are using these funds on strategies we know work like well-resourced schools, high-dosage tutoring and enriching afterschool programs – and directing the most resources towards students who fell furthest behind. We must repair the damage done by Donald Trump’s mismanagement of the pandemic – and we will.” To learn more about how the U.S. Department of Education is taking action to drive recovery, read Secretary Cardona’s op-ed in USA TODAY here: U.S. Education Secretary: COVID hurt student academic achievements, but we can recover Use this new national report card responsibly – not to punish or label schools or educators, but to allow local leaders to target resources to communities and schools that need them most As secretary of Education , I’ve traveled to 35 states and talked with countless students, families and educators. In every conversation, it’s clear: The pandemic has had profound impacts on our children and youth . Our students’ academic performance will reflect these impacts – as well as inequities in educational opportunity that preceded and continued through the pandemic. The latest data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress confirms this, showing long-term trends for America’s 9-year-olds in reading and math. While NAEP scores were not increasing before March 2020, these results show that we cannot be complacent about accelerating our students’ academic outcomes. From Day One of this administration, President Joe Biden recognized these threats the pandemic would have on our students’ academic progress. It’s why he made it the Department of Education’s top priority to get schools safely reopened for in-person learning and to get students back into classrooms. We did – but we know it’s not enough. That’s also why under President Biden’s American Rescue Plan, we’ve directed over $130 billion in funding to school districts across the country to keep schools open and help them accelerate student learning. This data should serve as a further call to action for states, districts and communities to use these funds quickly, effectively and on strategies we know work. We must raise the bar for our students now and use the resources we have to meet that bar. We must recognize this moment for the urgency it carries: Our students – and the progress of our country – depend on it. While we use this new data to help sharpen and focus our plans to accelerate student growth, we also know that many of our students are on track to make significant academic progress this school year. Recent data from the National Center for Education Statistics – which are not reflected in this week’s NAEP results – show that a substantial portion of students who were behind grade level in at least one subject last school year caught up in time for summer break this year. At the beginning of the 2021-22 school year, about half of students were behind grade level in at least one subject, according to school leaders. But by the end of the school year, that percentage declined to 36%. Initial state assessment results in places like Indiana and Connecticut also show that many students made enough progress to close some of the pandemic-related achievement gaps. This progress is a testament to the enduring impacts our educators and school staffs can make on helping our students catch up, both academically and developmentally. In red states and blue states, schools are putting relief funds to work – promoting student learning and following guidance from the department to invest in evidence-based efforts that have the greatest potential to boost student outcomes. We’ve seen places like Guilford County Schools in North Carolina use millions in federal relief funds to provide nearly 67,000 hours of intensive tutoring to their students in the past year alone. In Kentucky, Jefferson County Public Schools are opening student support centers staffed by retired teachers who are committed to using their expertise to provide targeted supports to students. We launched the National Partnership for Student Success earlier this year, which is bringing together federal, state, local and community partners with the goal of providing 250,000 more tutors and mentors to help support recovery. Because great teachers are essential to our progress in education, I also issued a call for state, district and higher education leaders to work together to tap federal resources to address the national educator shortage, strengthen the educator pipeline and keep teachers in the classroom. States and districts are stepping up. This year, Iowa is using over $45 million in relief funds to create a program to train 500 new teachers and 500 new paraeducators to support and accelerate student recovery across the state. These examples are just snapshots of progress happening all across the country. But we know we can’t take our foot off the gas. Helping our students not just recover but also thrive will take collective action, dedication and resources from local, state and federal partners. It will require us to listen to the needs of parents, teachers and students who continue to live out the impact of the pandemic in schools and classrooms across the country. It must take a commitment from all of us to use data responsibly – not to punish or label schools or educators, but to allow local leaders to target resources to communities and schools that need them most. Together, we can ensure that the road to success for our students continues to run straight through America’s public schools, and that the best days in education are ahead of us. Miguel Cardona is the U.S. Department of Education secretary."

Yet for years, our education system has faced challenges in attracting, recruiting, and retaining qualified teachers – challenges that were made worse by the pandemic. As children across the country start the 2022-2023 school year, too many schools are struggling to fill vacancies for teachers, including with qualified teachers, and other critical school professionals – such as bus drivers, paraprofessionals, nurses, and mental health professionals – positions that are essential to help our students recover academically, access the mental health supports they need, and thrive in and out of the classroom. Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing new efforts to strengthen the teaching profession and support schools in their effort to address teacher shortages as the new school year begins. This announcement includes new commitments from leading job platforms to make it easier for Americans to find opportunities in the education field, and new initiatives from teachers’ unions and national and state organizations to expand high-quality pathways into the profession for future teachers. The President has been clear from day one that to address these long-standing staffing challenges facing our schools, exacerbated by the pandemic, teachers, paraprofessionals, and other school staff need to be paid competitively and treated with the respect and dignity that they deserve, including through improved working conditions for staff and learning conditions for students. Today’s announcements build on this call, and the actions the President has already taken to invest in and support educators across the country and address staffing shortages. The $130 billion in President Biden’s American Rescue Plan (ARP) directed to the nation’s K-12 schools have allowed school districts across the country to invest in teacher pipeline programs, increase compensation for teachers, and hire more professionals across the education workforce. ARP funding has helped school districts increase the number of school social workers by 54%, increase the number of school counselors by 22%, and increase the number of school nurses by 22% compared to years prior to the pandemic. Today’s announcements reflect additional steps by the Administration and leaders across sectors to continue to tackle this challenge. This afternoon, First Lady Jill Biden, U.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona, U.S. Labor Secretary Martin Walsh, Ambassador Susan Rice, the executive leadership of ZipRecruiter, Handshake, Indeed, and leaders from the National Governors Association (NGA), American Federation of Teachers (AFT), National Education Association (NEA), Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO), and American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education will convene in the Roosevelt Room to discuss the staffing challenges schools are facing, these new actions, and additional ways that the federal government, state and local governments, education organizations and the private sector can strengthen the teaching profession. Talent Industry Announces New Commitments to Help School Districts Source Talent and Help More Americans Find Jobs in Schools. Today, leading talent recruitment and job platforms are announcing a series of new actions to make it easier for states and school districts to source, recruit, and hire job seeking teachers and school professionals, and to help more Americans find jobs in education: Today, ZipRecruiter is launching a new online job portal specifically dedicated to K-12 school jobs . This hub will showcase job openings across public schools throughout the United States, including teachers, nurses, guidance counselors, social workers, mental health counselors, librarians, and more. Schools, districts, and states can partner with ZipRecruiter to have their open roles included for free. The portal will also feature additional hiring resources including best practices for both job seekers and school districts’ human resource teams. Handshake will help college students explore careers in education. In October 2022, Handshake will host a nationwide free virtual event to help current undergraduate students learn about pathways in the field of education, including teachers, guidance counselors, school mental health specialists, and school psychologists. This event will provide information on how educators can make an impact and provide practical advice about building a career in the teaching profession. Alongside the event, Handshake will publish a list of all schools and districts hiring students and college graduates for jobs this year, helping aspiring educators kick off their career search. The Handshake network includes 10 million current and recent students at 1,400 two-and four-year colleges and universities nationwide, including 281,000 current students pursuing education degrees. Indeed is announcing that it will facilitate virtual hiring fairs for educators throughout the country. These events will specifically focus on the hiring of teachers, administrators, counselors, and other staff. Participating entities will gain access to Indeed’s free suite of hiring tools to manage the end-to-end hiring process, from job postings through interviews. Biden-Harris Administration Announces New Actions and Highlights Resources to Strengthen the Educator Pipeline and Address Shortages. Today, the Department of Education (ED) and the Department of Labor (DOL) have issued a joint letter to state and local education and workforce leaders encouraging them to take a series of actions to address teacher and school staff shortages and invest in the teaching profession, including: Paying teachers a livable and competitive wage. Secretaries Cardona and Walsh are encouraging governors and district leaders to use American Rescue Plan’s Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief funds and the $350 billion in State and Local Fiscal Recovery funds to increase teacher pay. Low pay continues to be a significant contributor to a weak teacher pipeline and to a history of high turnover rates. On average , teachers make about 33 percent less than other college-educated professionals. Adjusted for inflation, the average weekly wages of public school teachers have only increased $29 between 1996 and 2021. Expanding high-quality programs that prepare and support teachers, including registered teacher apprenticeship programs . DOL is committing to prioritize the education sector in future apprenticeship funding, including its next round of over $100 million in apprenticeship grants, which will provide critical support for states and other partners looking to start and expand teacher apprenticeship programs. Students need qualified teachers who are prepared to teach them, and who reflect the diversity of our students. Teachers need affordable pathways into the profession. Registered teacher apprenticeship programs allow individuals – including those already working in schools, like teaching assistants – to earn while they learn, receiving pay while they gain teaching skills with the supervision of a mentor teacher, and take coursework to earn their teaching license. This allows teachers to gain robust experience in the classroom before leading their own and makes becoming a teacher more affordable. Once registered by DOL or their state apprenticeship agency, state and local workforce boards can use Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) Title I funds to support these programs. The Secretaries also encourage state and local workforce boards to collaborate with education systems to address non-instructional staffing shortages in schools. States like Tennessee have already used ARP funds to invest in and expand registered teacher apprenticeship programs, using immediate resources to make long-term investments in teaching programs in the state that also address current needs. registered teacher apprenticeship programs can be used to scale high-quality pathways into the profession, like residencies and Grow Your Own programs. These models provide robust classroom experience for teachers during their training. Grow Your Own programs specifically help districts develop their own teachers, in partnership with institutions of higher education, including by getting teaching assistants, career changers, and high school students on the pathway to becoming teachers. National Teacher Unions and State Organizations to Expand High-Quality Pathways for Teachers, including Teacher Apprenticeship Programs National organizations representing teachers, state school chiefs, governors, and teacher colleges are announcing today that they are working together to expand high-quality registered teacher apprenticeship programs, teaching residencies, and Grow Your Own programs. CCSSO, AFT, NEA, and NGA are announcing that they will work together with other partners in the field to identify best practices and support their members in pursuing registered apprenticeships or other key strategies that ensure teacher quality while offering increased pathways for entrance and growth in the profession. The Pathways Alliance – a coalition of public and private organizations dedicated to supporting a strong and diverse teacher pipeline – is creating national guidelines for registered teacher apprenticeship programs. These guidelines will help states and school districts establish high-quality registered teacher apprenticeship programs, building upon work currently underway to provide guidelines for high-quality teacher residencies. As part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to supporting and investing in educators, today the White House is holding a Public Service Loan Forgiveness Day of Action. Earlier this year, the Biden-Harris Administration made temporary changes to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program to make sure teachers and school staff can access the loan forgiveness they are eligible for. As part of today’s Day of Action, leading education organizations, including the American Federation of Teachers and National Education Association, are working to ensure that school staff across the nation are able to take advantage of the temporary changes to the program. To benefit from the temporary changes, borrowers must apply and certify their employment for the period of time they wish to count toward PSLF using the PSLF Help Tool . For more information, please visit www.PSLF.gov . The temporary changes end on Oct. 31, 2022. The White House is urging eligible teachers to take advantage today before time runs out."
29-Aug-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/education-department-approves-15-billion-debt-relief-79000-borrowers-who-attended-westwood-college,"Education Department Approves $1.5 billion in Debt Relief for 79,000 Borrowers Who Attended Westwood College","Today, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) announced that it will discharge all remaining federal student loans for borrowers who enrolled in any location of Westwood College (including enrollment in Westwood's online program) between January 1, 2002 through November 17, 2015 when it stopped enrolling new borrowers in advance of its 2016 closure. The Department has analyzed the evidence related to Westwood and concluded that the school engaged in widespread misrepresentations about the value of its credentials for attendees' and graduates' employment prospects such that all borrowers who attended during the period described above are entitled to a full loan discharge. This finding is based on extensive internal records, evidence from Westwood employees and administrators, and testimony recounting borrowers' first-hand experiences. This action will result in $1.5 billion in discharges for 79,000 borrowers, regardless of whether they have applied for a borrower defense discharge. Relief will be granted without any additional actions by the borrowers. ""Westwood College's exploitation of students and abuse of federal financial aid place it in the same circle of infamy occupied by Corinthian Colleges and ITT Technical Institute,"" said Under Secretary James Kvaal. ""Westwood operated on a culture of false promises, lies, and manipulation in order to profit off student debt that burdened borrowers long after Westwood closed. The Biden-Harris Administration will continue ramping up oversight and accountability to protect students and taxpayers from abuse and ensure that executives who commit such harm never work at institutions that receive federal financial aid again."" About the Westwood Findings Today's announcement is based upon several findings reached by the Department in the last two years about Westwood's conduct, which had previously resulted in the approval of $130 million in borrower defense discharges for approximately 4,000 borrowers. These findings include that Westwood routinely misled prospective students by grossly misrepresenting that its credentials would benefit their career prospects and earning potential—specifically by promising prospective students that they would be employed in their field within six months after graduation and that a Westwood degree would make them ""employable for the rest of [their lives]."" In fact, Westwood's marketing materials inflated the salary outcomes of its graduates and misrepresented national earnings data of college graduates as if they were data for Westwood graduates. Westwood also presented grossly inflated job placement rates. And the institution gave students a false ""employment pledge"" guaranteeing students that it would help pay their bills if they could not find a job within six months of graduating. Not only was that empty guarantee a key feature of a scheme to mislead students into taking out loans to enroll at Westwood, but the Department found no evidence that the school ever followed through on that promise. Westwood's criminal justice programs at its Illinois campuses highlight the lengths the school went to in its practice of misleading students. Westwood promised students in that program that they could expect jobs with law enforcement in Illinois, including the Chicago Police Department or the Illinois State Police Department, and even included those false claims in statewide television ads. However, Westwood never had the regional accreditation necessary to meet the state employment requirements during the time Westwood was open or for city positions from 2004 to 2010. As a result, it was impossible for Westwood students to achieve those employment goals. These Westwood findings are based upon Department review of important evidence provided by the attorneys general of Colorado and Illinois, including sworn statements from former students and employees, admissions call recordings, multi-media advertising, and Westwood's internal communications, policies, and trainings. ""Strong partnerships between the Department and state attorneys general enable us to uncover the actions of dishonest institutions, like Westwood College,"" said Federal Student Aid Chief Richard Cordray. ""Thanks to the valuable assistance of Attorneys General Phil Weiser of Colorado and Kwame Raoul of Illinois, we are delivering loan relief to all Westwood students who put their trust in an institution that decided to take advantage of them."" Westwood College was owned by Alta College, Inc. (Alta), which was located in Colorado. In 2002, Alta was acquired by Housatonic Partners, a private equity firm located in California and Massachusetts. Major executives at Alta included co-founder Kirk Riedinger and George Burnett. Earlier this year, Burnett was named the president of the University of Phoenix but left that position after the Department raised questions about his involvement at Westwood. Including today's announcement, the Department has now approved $14.5 billion in discharges for nearly 1.1 million borrowers whose colleges took advantage of them. Continued Commitment to Address the Burden of Growing College Costs Today's actions are part of the Biden-Harris Administration's broader efforts to tackle the growing cost of college, including by better implementing federal student loan relief programs. Last week, the Department announced targeted student debt cancellation of up to $20,000 for individuals with loans held by the Department. The cancellation is available to borrowers with incomes under $125,000 for individuals or $250,000 for families. Borrowers who received a Pell Grant and meet the income thresholds are eligible for $20,000 in debt cancellation, while others can receive $10,000 in debt cancellation. This action will help address the financial harms of the pandemic by smoothing the transition back to repayment and helping borrowers at highest risk of delinquencies or default once payments resume. Borrowers can learn more about how to apply for this relief by visiting www.studentaid.gov/debtrelief . Additionally, the Department announced initial details of a proposed rule to create a new income-driven repayment plan that will substantially reduce future monthly payments for lower- and middle-income borrowers. This proposed rule is part of the Department's efforts to make long-term improvements to existing student loan forgiveness programs and provide greater protections for students and taxpayers against unaffordable debts. While the Department works to implement this broad-based assistance, it remains committed to providing support for borrowers through other targeted relief programs. To date, those efforts have resulted in nearly $34 billion in approved loan discharges for close to 1.7 million borrowers. Further, the Department has already taken action to strengthen institutional accountability so that students are not left with mountains of debt and little payoff, particularly from fraudulent institutions. The Department has re-established the office of enforcement within Federal Student Aid that conducts investigations into institutions of higher education. The Department is also holding responsible the accreditation agencies that oversee academic quality at institutions. On August 19, Deputy Secretary Cindy Marten reaffirmed a decision to terminate federal recognition of the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools (ACICS). As a result, colleges currently accredited by the ACICS will now be required to fulfill additional operating conditions for continued participation in the federal student aid programs. ACICS had accredited Westwood, ITT Technical Institute, and many branches of Corinthian Colleges prior to their closure. The Department will also propose future rules to hold career programs accountable for leaving their graduates with mountains of unaffordable debt and poor job prospects—a rule the last Administration rolled back. In the coming months, the Department will announce new actions to hold accountable institutions that have contributed to the student debt crisis including publishing lists of the worst actors."
26-Aug-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/department-awards-over-29-million-10-states-innovative-equitable-approaches-improve-student-learning,"Department Awards Over $29 Million to 10 States for Innovative, Equitable Approaches to Improve Student Learning","Today, the U.S. Department of Education announced 11 awards totaling over $29 million to 10 state educational agencies (SEAs) under the 2022 Competitive Grants for State Assessments (CGSA) program, underscoring the Biden-Harris Administration's ongoing efforts to enhance the quality of educational supports. As the 2022-23 school year begins, the Department is redoubling its commitment to providing states and communities with additional resources to accelerate student learning. Through these awards, the Department is encouraging high-quality, innovative and authentic assessments that advance teaching and learning and continue­­ state effo­rts to provide timely and meaningful information to educators, parents, and students themselves. Funded initiatives will support multilingual learners and students with disabilities, improve the utility and instructional relevance of assessment results, and develop local capacity to design and implement performance-based assessments. These awards reflect this year's CGSA competition priorities, which emphasized better understanding student academic achievement using multiple, high-quality measures; piloting assessment systems that are more customized and personalized (including competency- and technology-based assessments); supporting effective instruction and building educator capacity through the development of high-quality assessments of student learning; and helping parents and families better understand and use assessment data to support their child's education. ""Congratulations to these new grantees on their innovative approaches to better understanding student achievement and growth,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""With more authentic, relevant, and engaging assessments, educators and school leaders have more tools to personalize instruction to meet students' diverse needs; make critical, data-informed decisions that can positively affect student opportunities and outcomes; and communicate progress to parents and families. With this enhanced data and the resources from the American Rescue Plan, our school leaders have the resources to support students who need them the most, which is vital as our nation recovers from the pandemic. Ultimately, student assessment data should be focused on driving resources to students who need the most support, not on labeling schools and teachers especially while we are recovering from a pandemic."" The CGSA grants will help position these states to develop assessments that align with depth and breadth of state academic standards, measure high order thinking schools, enhance collaborations between K-12 and postsecondary institutions, emphasize equity considerations in assessment design, and pilot new assessment types, including assessments designed to be more instructionally relevant. Statewide summative assessment can be designed to incorporate multiple measures of student learning that can provide valuable information to educators, students, parents or caregivers, and the public about gaps in student opportunities and outcomes. These systems are critical tools as states, districts, schools, and educators use multiple, high-quality measures to better understand the impacts of the pandemic on student learning, especially for underserved students, and chart plans for continued academic recovery.

25-Aug-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-releases-back-school-checklist-parents,U.S. Department of Education Releases Back-to-School  Checklist for Parents,"Today, the Department of Education released a back-to-school checklist for parents and families. The checklist, part of the Department’s updated back-to-school resource site, will help parents, caregivers, and families engage with local school and district leaders about how they are supporting students as they recover from the impacts of the pandemic. This checklist elevates key evidence-based practices for supporting students’ learning and mental health, and ensuring the safety of students and staff, which districts are encouraged to implement using American Rescue Plan and other COVID relief funds. This back-to-school ARP checklist also recognizes 15 promising examples of how states and school districts across the country are already using federal ARP funds to support students and to staff schools. Through the ARP, the Biden-Harris Administration provided states and school districts with $130 billion to help students recover, succeed, and thrive. The checklist will serve as a resource for parents, caregivers, and families to have an open dialogue with their school community about these critical funds. To foster transparency and community engagement, the ARP requires states, local districts, and public charter schools to have meaningful stakeholder engagement and publicly post their planned use of ARP dollars. This checklist can support those efforts. “A new school year brings new beginnings, and today I am encouraging schools and families to reach a new level of communication and transparency to make sure our students and educators are getting the supports they need,” said Secretary Miguel Cardona. “The checklist offers a starting point for parents, caregivers, and families to have meaningful discussions with school leaders about how they are supporting students, including with American Rescue Plan funds. The checklist can kickstart conversations about the services and supports that children can benefit from in this new academic year and beyond.” When President Biden took office, less than half of K-12 schools were open for in-person learning. Since then, with the help of ARP dollars, schools have safely reopened with improved safety measures, programs to help students grow academically, and new supports for students’ mental health and other basic needs. Secretary Cardona joined a press call with White House officials, members of Congress, and local educators whose districts are among those being featured in order to encourage parents and families to use this checklist and discuss how the ARP is providing unprecedented resources for a successful and safe school year. The checklist is broken into four categories: Student learning Addressing the needs of the whole child COVID-19 health and safety Engaging families The states and school districts being recognized for their efforts utilizing ARP funds are: Arkansas Iowa Mississippi Puerto Rico Tennessee Aurora Public Schools in Colorado Denver Public Schools in Colorado Detroit Public Schools in Michigan Gaston County Schools in North Carolina Guilford County Schools in North Carolina Houston Independent School District in Texas Jefferson County Public Schools in Kentucky New York City Department of Education Saint Paul Public Schools in Minnesota Santa Fe Public Schools in New Mexico"
24-Aug-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-announces-final-student-loan-pause-extension-through-december-31-and-targeted-debt-cancellation-smooth-transition-repayment,Biden-Harris Administration Announces Final Student Loan Pause Extension Through December 31 and Targeted Debt Cancellation to Smooth Transition to Repayment,"Today, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) announced a final extension of the pause on student loan repayment, interest, and collections through December 31, 2022. Borrowers should plan to resume payments in January 2023. While the economy continues to improve, COVID cases remain at an elevated level, and the President has made clear that pandemic-related relief should be phased out responsibly so that people do not suffer unnecessary financial harm. To address the financial harms of the pandemic by smoothing the transition back to repayment and helping borrowers at highest risk of delinquencies or default once payments resume, the Department will provide targeted student debt cancellation to borrowers with loans held by the Department of Education. Borrowers with annual income during the pandemic of under $125,000 (for individuals) or under $250,000 (for married couples or heads of households) who received a Pell Grant in college will be eligible for up to $20,000 in debt cancellation. Borrowers who met those income standards but did not receive a Pell Grant will be eligible for up to $10,000 in relief. The Department will be announcing further details on how borrowers can claim this relief in the weeks ahead. The application will be available no later than when the pause on federal student loan repayments terminates at the end of the year. Nearly 8 million borrowers may be eligible to receive relief automatically because relevant income data is already available to the Department. The Department is also making available a legal memorandum regarding its authority for these discharges. The Department is also proposing a rule to create a new income-driven repayment plan that will substantially reduce future monthly payments for lower- and middle-income borrowers. The proposed rule would protect more income from loan payments. It would cut in half—from 10% to 5% of discretionary income—the amount that borrowers have to pay each month on their undergraduate loans, while borrowers with both undergraduate and graduate loans will pay a weighted average rate. It would also raise the amount of income that is considered nondiscretionary income and therefore protected from repayment. The rule would also forgive loan balances after 10 years of payments, instead of the current 20 years under many income-driven repayment plans, for borrowers with original loan balances of $12,000 or less. Additionally, the proposed rule would fully cover the borrower’s unpaid monthly interest, so that—unlike with current income-driven repayment plans—a borrower’s loan balance will not grow so long as they are making their required monthly payments. The plan would also simplify borrowers’ choices among loan repayment plans. The proposed regulations will be published in the coming days on the Federal Register and the public is invited to comment on the draft rule for 30 days. ""Earning a college degree or certificate should give every person in America a leg up in securing a bright future. But for too many people, student loan debt has hindered their ability to achieve their dreams—including buying a home, starting a business, or providing for their family. Getting an education should set us free; not strap us down! That’s why, since Day One, the Biden-Harris administration has worked to fix broken federal student aid programs and deliver unprecedented relief to borrowers, "" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""Today, we’re delivering targeted relief that will help ensure borrowers are not placed in a worse position financially because of the pandemic, and restore trust in a system that should be creating opportunity, not a debt trap."" Additionally, the Department is proposing long-term changes to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program that will make it easier for borrowers working in public service to gain loan forgiveness. Specifically, the Department proposed allowing more payments to qualify for PSLF including partial, lump sum, and late payments, and allowing certain kinds of deferments and forbearances – such as those for Peace Corps and AmeriCorps service, National Guard duty, and military service – to count toward PSLF. These proposed regulatory changes build on the progress made with the temporary changes announced last year by the Department that expire on October 31, 2022. Since the start of the temporary changes, the Department has approved more than $10 billion in loan discharges for 175,000 public servants. To apply for forgiveness or payments to count toward forgiveness under the temporary changes, visit the PSLF Help Tool. The Department is also taking steps to reduce the cost of college for students and their families and hold colleges accountable for raising costs, especially when failing to deliver good outcomes to students. The Department has already re-established the enforcement unit in the Office of Federal Student Aid and recently withdrew authorization for the accreditor that oversaw schools responsible for some of the worst for-profit scandals. The agency will also propose to reinstate and improve a rule to hold career programs accountable for leaving their graduates with unaffordable debt. And the Department is announcing new steps to take action against colleges that have contributed to the student debt crisis. These include publishing an annual watch list of the programs with the worst debt levels in the country and requesting institutional improvement plans from colleges with the most concerning debt outcomes that outline how the college intends to bring down debt levels. The Biden-Harris Administration will keep fighting to reduce the cost of higher education by working to make community college free and doubling the maximum size of the Pell Grant."
23-Aug-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/thanks-temporary-changes-us-department-education-announces-public-service-loan-forgiveness-surpasses-10-billion-debt-relief,"Thanks to Temporary Changes,  U.S. Department of Education Announces Public Service Loan Forgiveness Surpasses $10 Billion in Debt Relief","Today, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) announced that it has approved more than $10 billion in debt relief for over 175,000 borrowers in 10 months through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program. This follows changes the Department announced in October 2021 that transformed the program by changing certain rules to make it easier for public servants with federal student loans to have their debts cancelled. “For far too long, teachers, nurses, veterans, government employees, and countless others dedicated to serving our country found Public Service Loan Forgiveness to be nothing more than an empty promise, and before President Biden took office, only 7,000 borrowers ever managed to qualify,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “Today’s announcement that we’ve surpassed $10 billion in forgiveness for more than 175,000 public servants shows that the Biden-Harris administration’s efforts to cut red tape are turning the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program from a promise broken into a promise kept. We’re committed to helping borrowers who choose to pursue careers in education, public health, social work, law enforcement, and other critical fields receive the benefits to which they’re entitled for leading lives of service.” Borrowers in states across the country continue to benefit from the temporary changes to the PSLF program and more than 1 million borrowers have also received additional credit toward forgiveness, with the typical borrower receiving more than a year’s worth of progress. The Department is encouraging individuals to take action before the October 31 deadline. Federal student loan borrowers who are eligible can receive credit for payments that would otherwise not qualify for the program. Temporary Changes to PSLF The temporary changes allow student borrowers to get credit for payments made on loans from Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program, Perkins Loan Program, and other federal student loans. These borrowers must apply to consolidate their loans into a Direct Consolidation Loan before the deadline of October 31 to qualify for the program under the temporary changes. Additionally, under the temporary changes, past periods of repayment count whether or not borrowers were on a qualifying repayment plan or whether ornot borrowers made payments. Most borrowers who work or worked for a non-profit, or federal, state, Tribal or local government since 2007 and who were repaying their loans are eligible. Borrowers can also combine multiple sources of part-time employment to qualify and months in service do not have to be consecutive. “The Department recognizes this relief has made a meaningful difference in the lives of public service workers and non-profit employees and encourages borrowers to visit StudentAid.gov/pslfwaiver to learn more about the program before the October 31 deadline,” said Under Secretary of Education James Kvaal. The Biden-Harris Administration is leading four PSLF Days of Action, each focused on a different public sector, to encourage public servants across the nation to take advantage of temporary changes to the PSLF program. A PSLF toolkit for employers can be found here and stakeholders can use the toolkit found here . Today’s announcement is part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s broader efforts to get students and borrowers the benefits to which they are entitled. These efforts include enacting lasting policies to make college more affordable and preventing a future debt crisis by holding schools accountable for leaving students with mountains of debt and without the skills and preparation to find good jobs. To date, $32 billion in student loan relief has been approved for over 1.6 million borrowers. This includes: $13 billion for 1 million borrowers whose institutions took advantage of them through discharges related to borrower defense and school closures; More than $10 billion for over 175,000 borrowers through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program; and $9 billion in total and permanent disability discharges for more than 425,000 borrowers. The Department is also working on new regulations that will permanently improve a variety of the existing student loan forgiveness program by significantly reducing monthly payments and providing greater protections for borrowers."

OCR determined that the district violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its implementing regulations by failing to respond appropriately to notice of on-going anti-Semitic harassment of a student by other students. OCR found that the student was subjected to months of harassment, both in school and on social media, by numerous classmates. The harassment included calling her anti-Semitic slurs and disparaging and joking about her Jewish heritage, over a period of five months. The harassment the student experienced and the district’s failure to provide the student with a safe school environment caused her to suffer significant and enduring academic and emotional harm. OCR also found that the harassment the district failed to address persisted school wide. Although the district confirmed that anti-Semitic harassment occurred on campus and in classrooms, including by finding that nine students had engaged in anti-Semitic harassment for several months, the district did not assess whether the verified, widespread harassment negatively impacted other students. The district did not take any school wide measures to address the anti-Semitic harassment until several months after confirming its existence, which allowed a potential hostile environment to persist in the school. As a result of these failures, OCR determined that the district permitted the student to be subjected to a hostile environment based on her Jewish ancestry that was sufficiently severe, persistent, or pervasive that it interfered with the student’s ability to participate in or benefit from the school’s program. The resolution agreement commits the district to take steps to ensure nondiscrimination based on race, color, or national origin (including based on shared ancestry and ethnic characteristics) in all of its education programs and activities. “As we see a distressing rise in reports of anti-Semitism on campuses across the country, I commend Kyrene School District #28 for committing today to take essential steps to ensure that no other students will have to suffer anti-Semitic harassment or other harassment based on their shared ancestry,” said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon. The district’s commitments in the voluntary resolution agreement include: Addressing the student’s academic and counseling needs resulting from the harassment. Reviewing and revising its policies and procedures to address Title VI’s prohibition of harassment based on race, color, or national origin, including shared ancestry, including by clarifying in its policies and procedures that the prohibition against harassment includes harassment based on Jewish ancestry. Providing training to district staff regarding the district’s obligation to respond to complaints of harassment based on race, color, or national origin. Providing age-appropriate information programs for students to address harassment based on race, color, or national origin. And, Conducting a climate survey to assess the prevalence of harassment in the student’s former school and provide suggestions for effective ways to address harassment. The letter to Kyrene School District #28 is available here and the resolution agreement is available here ."
19-Aug-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-terminates-federal-recognition-acics-enhances-federal-aid-program-participation-requirements-acics-accredited-colleges,"U.S. Department of Education Terminates Federal Recognition of ACICS, Enhances Federal Aid Program Participation Requirements for ACICS-accredited Colleges","EDITOR’S NOTE : An earlier version of this release noted enrollment of ACICS-accredited institutions was 3,800. That number has been updated to nearly 5,000 students. Today, the U.S. Department of Education announced that colleges currently accredited by the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools (ACICS) will now be required to fulfill additional operating conditions for continued participation in the federal student aid programs. This requirement follows U.S. Deputy Secretary of Education Cindy Marten's final decision to terminate federal recognition of ACICS. Although ACICS is no longer a nationally recognized accrediting agency, the Department will provisionally certify ACICS-accredited institutions for continued participation in the federal student aid programs for up to 18 months from today, the date of the Deputy Secretary's final decision. This 18-month provisional certification period allows institutions time to seek accreditation from another nationally recognized accrediting agency. During this period of provisional certification, the Department will require the ACICS-accredited institutions to comply with additional conditions that are designed to protect students and safeguard taxpayer dollars. These conditions include additional monitoring, transparency, oversight, and accountability measures. Only ACICS-accredited institutions that agree to these conditions may continue to offer federal student aid. The Department's Federal Student Aid office will begin sending provisional program participation agreements (PPAs) to the affected institutions, which will have 10 calendar days to respond affirmatively to the new agreements to remain eligible to participate in federal student aid programs. The additional PPA conditions establish strong protections for students and taxpayers, preventing ACICS-accredited institutions from establishing new programs or locations or enrolling new students who will be unable to complete the program by the end of the provisional period unless the institutions become accredited by a new nationally recognized agency. Within 30 days, all ACICS-accredited institutions will be required to submit teach-out plans for helping students complete their academic programs elsewhere if necessary and submit information about recent and ongoing investigations to ensure the Department is aware of key risks in this new environment of reduced oversight. Other new requirements for ACICS-accredited institutions include: Submitting teach-out plans to ensure a path to completion for students in the event of closure; Providing enhanced disclosures to students regarding potential loss of federal student aid eligibility; Limiting enrollment of new students who would be unable to complete their program of study before the 18-month provisional period ended; Ceasing additions of new programs or locations that qualify for Federal student aid; Submitting monthly student rosters and a record retention plan; and Posting a letter of credit to protect against taxpayer losses associated with school closure. ACICS no longer Recognized as Federal Aid ""Gatekeeper"" In her decision letter, Deputy Secretary Marten wrote: ""Recognition by the Department must be reserved for agencies that adhere to high standards, just as accreditation by agencies must be reserved for institutions and programs that adhere to high standards. The regulations provide for conditional recognition for up to 12 months, the kind of latitude ACICS seeks on this matter, when an agency will remedy an instance of noncompliance in that time period. However, ACICS has already had multiple opportunities to achieve full compliance. ACICS was found noncompliant with 34 C.F.R. § 602.15(a)(2) as far back as 2016. Despite its professed improvements, the agency remained out of compliance in 2018, at which time it was given another opportunity to reach full compliance. Its continuing failure to reach full compliance with this criterion alone is a sufficient basis to terminate ACICS' recognition."" The Deputy Secretary's decision follows a several years-long process that began in 2016, with the Department's decision to cease recognizing ACICS. ACICS's appeal to have their recognition reinstated was denied by then Secretary of Education John B. King Jr. ACICS followed that decision with a lawsuit against the Department. After a federal judge required ED to consider new evidence, then Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos reinstated ACICS in 2018. ACICS currently accredits 27 schools that enroll nearly 5,000 students. When the Department ceased recognition in 2016, ACICS accredited 237 schools that enrolled 361,000 students. Last June, the Department's Senior Department Official (SDO) agreed with the recommendations of accreditation staff and NACIQI to withdraw recognition of ACICS. In its February 2021 final staff report, the Department's accreditation staff found that ACICS failed to comply with federal recognition criteria, including monitoring of compliance of institutions and inadequate administrative capability. ACICS appealed the SDO's decision, and the matter was referred to Deputy Secretary Marten. Deputy Secretary Marten's decision is the Department's final action. ACICS is no longer a nationally recognized accrediting agency and can no longer serve as a ""gatekeeper"" of institutional eligibility for federal student aid programs. Strengthening Accreditation of Colleges and Programs As gatekeepers to $112 billion in annual federal student aid, nationally recognized accrediting agencies serve a vital role in ensuring quality for students and families and in protecting students and taxpayers. The Department oversees the accrediting agency recognition process, which determines whether agencies are reliable authorities on educational quality. Since February 2021, the Department has taken a series of steps to strengthen the accreditation process. Releasing final analyses and recommendations for nationally recognized accrediting agencies under review. All nationally recognized accrediting agencies must successfully complete a review process every five years. In February 2021, the Department began releasing the final analyses and recommendations developed by agency staff to provide greater transparency and ensure confidence in the Department's review process. Reinstating Accreditor Dashboards. In July 2021, the Department also reintroduced the Accreditor Dashboards and accompanying data files. The dashboards, first introduced in 2016, provide greater transparency to the public around student outcomes, equity, and value to aid NACIQI in identifying areas for discussion, challenges in accreditor oversight, and inform their recommendations on recognition. Ensuring high standards in accreditor review process. In February 2022, the Department introduced a revised Accreditor Handbook to clarify expectations for agencies and ensure sufficient documentation in the public record for evaluating agencies for recognition, including on student achievement, actions taken against underperforming institutions or programs, and ensuring accreditors have adequate staff and resources to ensure quality, among other areas. The latest changes are intended to ensure accrediting agencies are holding institutions and programs to high standards. Combating ""Accreditor Shopping."" In July 2022, the Department issued guidance to help inform institutions and accrediting agencies about their responsibilities related to seeking a different accreditor. The guidance aims to prevent ""accreditation-shopping,"" the practice in which some institutions seek out specific accrediting agencies with less rigorous standards to sidestep accountability from an accrediting agency that investigates practices or takes corrective action against an institution. The Higher Education Act and Department regulations provide protections for students and taxpayers against this behavior. Strengthening Institutional Accountability In addition to strengthening the accreditation process, the Department has taken a series of steps to ensure that that all students have access to a valuable postsecondary education, and all institutions are held accountable for poor outcomes. Recently proposed regulations and executive actions that aim to strengthen institutional accountability include: Fortifying borrower defense to repayment and prohibiting mandatory arbitration. Proposed regulations would create a fair path for borrowers to receive a discharge if their colleges lied to or took advantage of them. This includes allowing for group claims, eliminating overly strict limits on when borrowers can file a claim, expanding the type of misconduct that can lead to an approved claim to include aggressive and deceptive recruitment practices, and ensuring borrowers receive timely decisions about their claims. To curb predatory behavior by colleges, the Department proposes a strong process for recouping the costs of such discharges from the college, running for at least six years following the borrower's last date of attendance at the school. The Department also proposes ensuring that borrowers whose schools take advantage of them be allowed their day in court. The proposal would prohibit colleges from requiring borrowers to sign mandatory pre-dispute arbitration agreements or class-action waivers. Holding institutions financially responsible. The Department has already demonstrated a commitment to increased accountability, including by requiring entities that operate private colleges, particularly those with potential risk factors, to sign the agreements between colleges and the Department and to assume joint responsibility for any liabilities. The change will further ensure colleges are held financially accountable for their conduct. Increasing transparency in change-of-ownership transactions. The Department recently sought to clarify the requirements and processes institutions must follow for change-of-ownership transactions to expand protections for students and taxpayers. The proposed regulations would clarify the definition of a nonprofit institution to prevent improper financial benefits to a former owner or other affiliate of a college. Additionally, institutions undergoing a change in ownership may also be required to provide additional financial protection or to comply with additional conditions to protect against the risk of the transaction. Closing the 90/10 Loophole. For-profit institutions have long been required by the Higher Education Act to obtain at least 10% of their revenue from sources other than federal student aid provided by the Department (e.g., Pell Grants and federal student loans). The American Rescue Plan Act requires that at least 10% of funds come from sources other than any federal education assistance—not just aid awarded by the Department. The proposed regulations would be a change from current practice, in which institutions can count federal student aid for veterans and service members to meet the 10 percent revenue test. These proposed regulations would codify this statutory change and ensure for-profit institutions do not aggressively target students who served our country. The Department is currently drafting final regulations for these proposals in response to comments and feedback from the public."
19-Aug-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/department-education-makes-8-million-new-grants-available-help-colleges-strengthen-and-diversify-teacher-workforce,Department of Education Makes $8 Million in New Grants Available to Help Colleges Strengthen and Diversify the Teacher Workforce,"Today, the U.S. Department of Education announced a new $8 million grant competition aimed at increasing the diversity of the teacher workforce and preparing teachers to meet the needs of our most underserved students. Named for Augustus F. Hawkins, the first Black politician elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from west of the Mississippi River, the Augustus F. Hawkins Centers of Excellence (Hawkins) program supports comprehensive, high-quality teacher preparation programs at historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) and Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs). A priority in President Biden’s FY 22 budget proposal, this year marks the first time the Hawkins Program has received funding since its creation in 2008. In the 2022 omnibus, Congress appropriated $8 million for the grants, under Part B of the Higher Education Act of 1965. “At a time when we need to do more to support our teachers and the educator profession, Hawkins Centers of Excellence will help increase the number of well-prepared and qualified teachers, including teachers of color, in our workforce,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “We know that teachers of color benefit not only students of color, but all students. When students of color can see their backgrounds and experiences reflected in their teachers, we see higher levels of student achievement and engagement in school, and more students aspiring to be teachers themselves one day.” The Hawkins Program will focus on key aspects of a high-quality teacher preparation pipeline, including evidence-based, comprehensive teacher preparation programs that provide extensive clinical experience. Grants will fund applicants that propose to incorporate evidence-driven practices into their teacher preparation programs. Studies have shown that teachers who enter the profession through comprehensive pathways are 2 to 3 times more likely to remain in the profession compared to teachers who enter through less comprehensive pathways. HBCUs, TCUs and MSIs prepare a disproportionate share of teachers of color. These colleges are uniquely positioned to recruit, prepare, and place teachers who will provide culturally and linguistically relevant teaching in underserved and hard-to-staff schools. Today’s teacher workforce does not reflect the demographics of the nation’s public school students. More than 50% of public school students are students of color, yet in 2017-18, the most recent year for which data were available, only 21% of teachers were teachers of color. And while English learners are the fastest growing public school student demographic, comprising more than 10% of America’s enrollment, most states face a shortage of bilingual and multilingual teachers prepared and qualified to teach this population and foreign languages. These roles are critical for ensuring Americans can compete in the increasingly globalized economy, equal access to education opportunity for English Learners, and the creation of a strong economy in which all Americans can thrive. As a result, the Notice Inviting Applications includes competitive priorities for applicants that propose projects designed to increase the number of well-prepared teachers from diverse backgrounds, as well as bilingual and multilingual teachers with full certification. The Hawkins Program grant program builds on the Department’s efforts to strengthen and diversify the teacher pipeline, especially as states and districts work to meet their staffing needs. Augustus F. Hawkins' public service included 56 years in the California Assembly and U.S. House of Representatives. Representative Hawkins guided countless pieces of legislation aimed at improving the lives of people of color and urban communities experiencing poverty. The Department is honored to implement this grant program and carry forward Representative Hawkins’ legacy. An official notice inviting applications will be published in the coming days in the Federal Register . An unofficial notice is available to view here"
19-Aug-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/department-invites-applicants-more-6-million-project-prevent-grant-program-funds-support-school-safety,Department Invites Applicants for More Than $6 Million in Project Prevent Grant Program Funds to Support School Safety,"Today, the U.S. Department of Education is posting a Notice Inviting Applications for the Project Prevent Grant Program, which will award more than $6 million to local educational agencies (LEAs) impacted by community violence. As part of the Biden-Harris administration’s broader commitment to school safety and addressing youth mental health the Department will provide schools the necessary resources to combat community violence and ensure a safe learning environment for students, families, and educators. Following the signing of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the Department will be announcing additional resources for schools in the weeks ahead. Project Prevent grants will expand the capacity of LEAs to implement community- and school-based strategies to help prevent community violence and mitigate the impacts of exposure to community violence. With these funds, LEAs can increase their capacity to identify, assess, and serve students exposed to community violence, helping LEAs to (1) increase student access to mental health services; (2) support conflict management programs; and (3) implement other community- and school-based strategies to help prevent community violence and to mitigate the impacts of exposure to community violence. As the Department works to address opportunity and achievement gaps, Project Prevent will deliver more resources for communities in need. “When our students are exposed to community violence and experience trauma, their learning, their mental health, and their overall wellbeing are affected. We must do everything in our power to prevent and address community violence and wrap our children in the supports and services that can help them overcome any barriers to their success,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “The availability of these new federal dollars will be transformative for our children and our communities. Together, we can give every student—especially students who need the greatest supports—what they need to learn, grow, heal, and thrive.” Research has demonstrated that community violence is a risk factor for facing an adverse childhood experience (ACE), such as abuse, neglect, witnessing violence, or having a family member who is incarcerated, and has an impact on future violence and victimization in a community. ACEs can increase risk among children and youth to experience depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic disorders; have difficulty in, or disconnect from, school and the workforce; and engage in delinquency or violent acts, potentially perpetuating the conditions that contribute to a cycle of community violence. Community violence is a significant public health, public safety, and community infrastructure concern nationwide and is a leading cause of death, injury, and intergenerational trauma for people in the United States. Community violence imposes enormous human, social, and economic costs, including disruption to employment and hindering a community’s social and economic development. The FY22 Project Prevent Grant Program has a focus on partnerships with community-based organizations to mitigate the impact of community violence on students and families implementing community and school-based strategies. Local educational agencies, or consortia of local educational agencies are eligible to apply for these grants. The Department is especially interested in programs that support children and youth from low-income backgrounds. With the right investments and supports, the impact of these experiences can be mitigated in ways that help our children and youth thrive. The Notice Inviting Applications is available here ."

McNair Postbaccalaureate Achievement Program (McNair). The program provides grants to universities and colleges for projects designed to provide disadvantaged college students effective preparation for doctoral studies. “When we look at U.S. students studying to become our future physicians, professors, scientists and other crucial professionals requiring graduate degrees, many demographic groups are underrepresented, including first-generation college students and those from low-income families,” said Nasser Paydar, assistant secretary, Office of Postsecondary Education. “McNair grants fund projects at universities and colleges that help underrepresented students to access doctoral programs.” Today’s announcement delivers on Secretary Cardona’s priorities to expand equitable access to education and make higher education more inclusive and affordable. Through McNair grant funding, projects at institutions of higher education provide students opportunities for research or other scholarly activities, such as summer internships and seminars. McNair-funded initiatives also prepare students for doctoral study through tutoring, academic counseling, and assistance with securing admission to and financial assistance for enrollment in graduate programs. McNair projects may also provide services designed to improve financial and economic literacy of students, mentoring programs, and exposure to cultural events and academic programs not usually available to disadvantaged students. A full list of the new grantees is below and includes 14 Historically Black College and Universities (HBCUs), and 55 Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) (including Hispanic Serving, Native American-Serving Non-Tribal Institutions, Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institutions). Several additional McNair awards will be announced on a second slate, expected in September. The McNair program is one of seven federal TRIO programs, targeted to serve and assist low-income individuals, first-generation college students, and individuals with disabilities to progress through the academic pipeline from middle school to postbaccalaureate programs. Research from the National Center for Education Statistics shows demographic trends for enrollment in postbaccalaureate programs, from 2009-2020.

16-Aug-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-educations-office-civil-rights-reaches-settlement-victor-valley-union-high-school-district-california,U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights Reaches Settlement with Victor Valley Union High School District in California,"The U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) today announced that the Victor Valley Union High School District in California has entered into a resolution agreement to end race discrimination in implementation of school discipline. OCR determined that the district discriminated based on race in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI) and its implementing regulations by disciplining Black students more frequently and more harshly than similarly situated white students. OCR identified a pattern of disparate disciplinary actions across types of discipline, schools, and grade levels that imposed greater harms – including in significant lost learning time – on Black students than their white peers. District discipline practices that disproportionately harmed Black students departed from district policies and state law. Throughout OCR's investigation, administrators, teachers, and student witnesses reported discrimination in multiple areas such as suspensions, expulsions, truancy, and issuance of law enforcement citations. This reported discrimination was consistent with statistical evidence of racial disparities in student discipline as well as with district records reflecting specific instances of harsher discipline of Black students as compared to white students who engaged in similar behavior. OCR also found that the district violated the Title VI regulations by failing to maintain and produce timely, complete, and accurate records regarding school discipline to demonstrate its compliance with Title VI. The voluntary resolution agreement with the district requires the district to revise its discipline policies and procedures, train its staff regarding them, and develop and implement a corrective action plan to ensure nondiscrimination in student discipline. The agreement also requires the district to offer and provide compensatory education for students harmed by its racially discriminatory discipline practices. ""I applaud the Victor Valley Union High School District's commitment today to rectify the harms its discipline practices caused to Black students and to ensure nondiscrimination in school discipline going forward,"" said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon. The district has already begun taking steps to implement the agreement. The district's commitments in the resolution agreement include: Examining the causes of racial disparities in the district's discipline and implementing a corresponding corrective action plan; Employing a director with expertise in nondiscriminatory discipline practices to help the district implement the corrective action plan and the agreement; Establishing a stakeholder equity committee to inform implementation of the plan; Revising its discipline policies and procedures, including regarding law enforcement involvement in school discipline; Regularly analyzing its student discipline data to identify and, as needed, address possible areas of discrimination; Providing training to staff on the revised discipline policies and practices; Publicly reporting disaggregated discipline data; Conducting school climate surveys to assess perceptions of fairness and safety; and Providing compensatory education to students subjected to discriminatory practices. The letter to Victor Valley Union High School District is available here and the resolution agreement is available here ."
16-Aug-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/education-department-approves-39-billion-group-discharge-208000-borrowers-who-attended-itt-technical-institute,"Education Department approves $3.9 billion group discharge for 208,000 borrowers who attended ITT Technical Institute","Today, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) announced that it will discharge all remaining federal student loans that borrowers received to attend ITT Technical Institute (ITT) from January 1, 2005, through its closure in September 2016. The decision, which follows Departmental findings based on extensive internal records, testimony from ITT managers and recruiters, and first-hand accounts from borrowers, will result in 208,000 borrowers receiving $3.9 billion in full loan discharges. This includes borrowers who have not yet applied for a borrower defense to repayment discharge. These borrowers will have the federal student loans they received to attend ITT discharged without any additional action on their part. ""It is time for student borrowers to stop shouldering the burden from ITT's years of lies and false promises,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""The evidence shows that for years, ITT's leaders intentionally misled students about the quality of their programs in order to profit off federal student loan programs, with no regard for the hardship this would cause. The Biden-Harris Administration will continue to stand up for borrowers who've been cheated by their colleges, while working to strengthen oversight and enforcement to protect today's students from similar deception and abuse."" The Department also announced that it formally notified DeVry University (DeVry), that it is required to pay millions of dollars for approved borrower defense applications. DeVry can submit information and arguments for why it should not be required to pay these liabilities or request a hearing before the Department's Office of Hearings and Appeals. Finally, the Department also announced the approval of discharges for just under 100 borrowers who enrolled in the Medical Assistant or Medical Billing & Coding Program at Kaplan Career Institute's Kenmore Square location in Massachusetts from July 1, 2011 to February 16, 2012 when the institution stopped enrolling new students. These are borrowers identified by Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey after an investigation found that the institution repeatedly lied about its job placement rates to borrowers, among other deceptive practices. The location closed in February 2013. Today's action brings the total amount of loan relief approved by the Biden-Harris Administration to nearly $32 billion for 1.6 million borrowers. This includes $13 billion related to institutions that took advantage of borrowers. It represents the Department's continued commitment to providing debt relief to eligible borrowers. About the Department's ITT findings Today's ITT announcement builds on the Administration's previous actions related to ITT , which has resulted in the approval of $1.9 billion in discharges for 130,000 students to date. This includes borrower defense findings that ITT engaged in widespread and pervasive misrepresentations related to the ability of students to get a job or transfer credits, and lying about the programmatic accreditation of ITT's associate degree in nursing. Separately, the Department announced an expanded window for borrowers who attended but did not graduate from ITT to receive closed school discharges. ""ITT defrauded hundreds of thousands of students, as we identified when I was the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau,"" said Federal Student Aid Chief Richard Cordray. ""By delivering the loan relief students deserve, we are giving them the opportunity to resume their educational journey without the unfair burden of student debt they are carrying from a dishonest institution."" The Department's findings around ITT were assisted by significant and extensive work by attorneys general across the country, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and Veterans Education Success. The Department received important evidence from half the country's state offices of attorneys general, led by Colorado and Oregon Attorneys General and supported by significant evidence from the Iowa and New Mexico Attorneys General. The Department's findings are based on extensive evidence, including internal ITT policies and records; recruitment materials and brochures; recordings of interactions between ITT's representatives and prospective students; testimony from former students, employees, and administrators; investigative files and submissions from congressional investigators and state offices of attorneys general; and the tens of thousands of individual borrower defense applications submitted by former ITT students. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's (CFPB) Investigation into ITT The CFPB's work to protect ITT borrowers resulted in action which barred ITT from engaging in predatory private student lending and resulted in $498 million in private student loan cancellation. The CFPB sued ITT in 2014 , alleging that ITT pressured its students into taking out high-cost private loans even though ITT knew most of its students would ultimately default. In 2019, the CFPB obtained a judgment barring ITT from offering or providing student loans. The CFPB also obtained judgments against several entities for providing substantial assistance to ITT in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act by owning and managing ITT's private student loans. ""The automatic loan cancellation announced today will provide life-changing relief that has long been owed to former ITT students,"" said Rohit Chopra, director of the CFPB. ""Far too many Americans are still on the hook for loans they acquired at colleges that profited from deceiving students, and the CFPB will continue to work with the Department of Education to address predatory student loan debt, to protect students, and to hold wrongdoers accountable."" DeVry Recoupment Action Yesterday, the Department formally notified DeVry that the institution is liable to the Department for nearly $24 million for approved borrower defense claims. This recoupment effort follows the Department's announcement in February 2022 that it had approved claims after finding that, from 2008 through 2015, DeVry had repeatedly misled prospective students across the country. DeVry claimed that 90 percent of its graduates who actively seek employment obtained jobs in their field of study within six months of graduation. In fact, the institution's actual job placement rate was around 58 percent. DeVry inflated its job placement rate by including students who found employment prior to graduation and by excluding others who did not conduct a job search in the college's preferred manner. The initial demand relates to the first group of DeVry Direct Loan borrowers whose loan discharges are in process with their servicers. The Department anticipates the number of approved discharge amounts to grow as it continues to adjudicate additional applications from former DeVry students and reserves the right to seek future recovery actions, as warranted. DeVry will have 20 days from issuance of the demand to submit additional written material or request a hearing on the matter before the Department's Office of Hearings and Appeals. If DeVry does not submit such a request within the required timeframe, the Department will impose the liabilities and require DeVry to pay, or enter an agreement to pay, the amount. Kaplan Career Institute Approvals The Kaplan approval of discharges for roughly 100 borrowers was based upon the Department's independent review of the evidence which primarily came to it in a request from the Office of the Massachusetts Attorney General. The Massachusetts Attorney General conducted a detailed investigation into the school and provided evidence to the Department that established that Kaplan repeatedly lied about its job placement rates to borrowers, telling them upwards of 70 percent of students got jobs, when the actual figure was as low as 25 percent. Kaplan inflated its rates by including temporary and part-time jobs and reported students as having been placed in their field even if the school's internal records indicated they were not. The Massachusetts Attorney General also provided evidence to the Department that Kaplan did not provide promised career services to borrowers. Continued Commitment to Targeted Loan Forgiveness Today's actions are part of the Biden-Harris Administration's broader efforts to ensure better implementation of the student loan programs to get students and borrowers the benefits to which they are entitled, including loan forgiveness. These efforts also include enacting lasting policies to make college more affordable and prevent a future debt crisis by holding schools accountable for leaving students with mountains of debt and without the skills and preparation to find good jobs. The nearly $32 billion in student loan relief approved to date includes: $13 billion for 1 million borrowers whose institutions took advantage of them through discharges related to borrower defense and school closures . $9.6 billion for 175,000 borrowers through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program. $9 billion in total and permanent disability discharges for more than 425,000 borrowers. The Department is also working on new regulations that will permanently improve a variety of the existing student loan forgiveness programs, significantly reduce monthly payments, and provide greater protections for students and taxpayers against unaffordable debts."

""This latest guidance from the CDC should give our students, parents, and educators the confidence they need to head back to school this year with a sense of joy and optimism. While COVID continues to evolve, so has our understanding of the science and what it takes to return to school safely.

10-Aug-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/during-%E2%80%98raise-bar%E2%80%99-summit-education-department-announces-college-completion-fund-competition-support-postsecondary-student-success,"During ‘Raise the B.A.R.’ Summit, Education Department Announces College Completion Fund Competition to Support Postsecondary Student Success","Today, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) announced the availability of $5 million in funds to support a new College Completion Fund for Postsecondary Student Success. The funding will support grants to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), and Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs) such as Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) – many of which are community colleges – to invest in data-driven and evidence-based reforms that encourage postsecondary retention, transfer, and completion. Institutions are specifically invited to focus on supporting existing students who are close to graduation and reengaging students who withdrew from school temporarily during the pandemic. The availability of the funds will be announced by Education Secretary Miguel Cardona today, during the Raise the B.A.R.: Bold + Action + Results in College Excellence & Equity Summit. The one-day summit is being held at the Department with higher education leaders from colleges, systems, and organizations across the country. This is the Department’s latest action delivering on the Secretary’s priority of making higher education more inclusive and affordable. “For far too long, our higher education system has left our nation’s most accessible, inclusive colleges without adequate resources to support student success, while many institutions chase rankings that reward privilege and selectivity over equity and upward mobility,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “Reimagining higher education means rejecting a status quo in which so many students earn some college credits but no degree, leaving them with student debt they cannot afford and less access to good-paying jobs. Today’s summit demonstrates the Biden-Harris Administration’s belief that investments in college completion can level up our entire higher education system and help more students from communities of color and other low-income and underserved communities make it to commencement day.” Invited guests will discuss opportunities to uplift inclusivity, equity, and excellence—rather than exclusivity and privilege—in our higher education system and share their experiences in reforming higher education to promote stronger outcomes, particularly for their students of color and low-income students. The summit will also serve as a launching pad for the Biden-Harris Administration’s renewed commitment to postsecondary student success, with remarks from White House and Department leadership. Additionally, the Department is announcing today that it plans to extend its Project Success initiative, currently set to expire next month, for an additional three-year period. Through Project Success, more than 200 HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs, including HSIs, receive access to resources and support services to help improve their students’ outcomes. The extension announced today will enable the Department to continue the initiative and increase its focus on evidence-based strategies, including through capacity-building networks focused in improving student success. Institutions seeking funding under the College Completion Fund for Postsecondary Student Success have 60 days to submit their applications. Applicants should describe the work that their institutions are doing to promote retention and completion, propose activities and initiatives to be implemented through the program that meet at least the Department’s definition of promising evidence, and present a high-quality evaluation plan. Grantees will be eligible for up to $1 million in grant funds to support their proposals. All institutions eligible for Titles III and V, including HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs, including HSIs, are eligible to apply. The Department has also established an invitational priority for community colleges where enrollment declines during the national emergency have been most severe and additional funds can help to support efforts to reengage students and get their educational pathways back on track. The funds provided through the College Completion Fund for Postsecondary Student Success are the latest action in the Department’s continued commitment to ensuring student success, particularly for students of color and low-income students. The Department has continued to improve upon and provide high-quality information about student outcomes through the College Scorecard, improving student choice about higher education. Additionally, the Department continues to lift up inclusive institutions and has proposed billions of dollars in new funding for HBCUs, TCUs, MSIs, and community colleges. The Department is also working to promote innovation at colleges and universities across the country, including by requesting $110 million from Congress for the upcoming fiscal year to support additional retention and completion grants."

4-Aug-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/statement-secretary-education-national-center-education-statistics-data-showing-student-recovery-throughout-2021-2022-school-year,Statement from Secretary of Education on National Center for Education Statistics' Data Showing Student Recovery Throughout the 2021-2022 School Year,"U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona released the statement below following the release of the National Center for Education Statistics' (NCES) June 2022 data that highlights an improvement in student performance and three-quarters of public schools offering summer learning and enrichment programs to help students catch up. ""When the Biden-Harris Administration came into office, we knew we had to take urgent action to get schools reopened, get students back on track, and make sure they had the mental health supports they needed. This data shows that through the efforts of this Administration, and with the strong partnership of school leaders, teachers, school staff, families, parents, and students across the country, students have made significant progress just over the course of the 2021-2022 school year,"" said Secretary Cardona. ""Additionally, this data shows that school districts across the country are using American Rescue Plan funds to expand access to summer learning and enrichment programs, hire more school counselors, meet the mental health needs of students and educators, accelerate student learning, provide high-quality tutoring, and more. As we continue to move through recovery, we must work together to help students succeed by improving the education system so that our students are given every opportunity to achieve at much higher levels than March 2020 and truly thrive."" Key findings from the NCES school pulse panel include: 56 percent of public schools using high-dosage tutoring to support pandemic learning recovery with the most school leaders rating this strategy as extremely or very effective 75 percent of public schools offering summer learning and enrichment programs, with 33 percent of these schools reporting that they increased their summer learning and enrichment programs A double-digit drop in the percentage of students that schools are reporting are behind grade level in at least one subject (from the beginning to the end of the 21-22 school year) 72 percent of public schools offering mental health supports Nearly all public schools offering in-person learning Through the American Rescue Plan (ARP), the Biden-Harris Administration is investing in evidence-based solutions that are driving academic recovery and providing additional mental health supports. Since education was disrupted in March 2020 due to the covid-19 pandemic, the Biden-Harris Administration has prioritized recovery for students through multiple efforts. In addition to providing $130 billion in ARP funds for K-12 education to support the safe reopening of K-12 schools and to meet the needs of all students, the Biden-Harris Administration: Launched the National Partnership for Student Success to recruit 250,000 new tutors and mentors. The Department joined forces with leading education, youth development, and service organizations to launch the National Partnership for Student Success (NPSS) , a new coalition that will support the expansion, launch, and improvement of high-impact tutoring, mentoring and other programs to make up for lost instructional time, and support student mental health and overall wellbeing. The NPSS follows President Biden's call for more tutors and mentors in the 2022 State of the Union Address to help students recover from the pandemic and thrive. Launched the Engage Every Student Initiative. To support summer learning and afterschool programs, the Department launched the Engage Every Student Initiative that will help communities utilize ARP funds, alongside other state and local funds, to ensure that every child who wants a spot in a high-quality out-of-school time program has one, whether through a high-quality summer or afterschool program. Highlighted schools effectively supporting students and shared best practices. The Department launched a campaign through the Best Practices Clearinghouse to highlight and celebrate evidence-based and promising practices implemented by states, schools, and school districts using ARP funds to support learning recovery, increased academic opportunities, and student mental health. The updated Best Practices Clearinghouse is the next phase of the Safer Schools and Campuses Best Practices Clearinghouse that the Department launched in spring 2021, originally designed to share best practices around safely reopening schools, addressing inequities made worse by the pandemic, and providing summer learning and enrichment opportunities to help students get reconnected to their communities, peers, and educators. Is awarding the first of nearly $300 million the President secured through the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act and the FY2022 Omnibus Agreement to expand access to mental health services in schools. By increasing the number of qualified mental health professionals in our schools, and thereby reducing the number of students each provider serves, this funding, which is being allocated to two critical programs, will meaningfully improve access to mental health services for vulnerable students. This week, the Department will begin the process of disbursing almost $300 million Congress appropriated in FY22 through both the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act and the FY22 Omnibus to help schools hire more school-based mental health professionals and build a strong pipeline into the profession for the upcoming school year. The two critical programs are the Mental Health Service Professional Demonstration Grant Program and the School-Based Mental Health Services Grant Program. Launched the National Parents and Families Engagement Council . In order to empower parents and school communities with knowledge about how their schools are using and can use federal funds to provide the necessary academic and mental health supports, the Department launched the National Parents and Families Engagement Council to facilitate strong and effective relationships between schools and parents, families, and caregivers. Made it easier for families and stakeholders to see how their states and school districts are using ARP funds by requiring State Educational Agency and Local Educational Agency plans for using ARP Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) funds and making those plans accessible to the public through an interactive map. Will continue to track progress in providing additional learning opportunities. The Institute for Education Sciences, the Department of Education's statistics, research, and evaluation arm, will continue to use monthly surveys to track schools' continued progress in providing summer learning and enrichment, tutoring, and afterschool supports."
29-Jul-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-two-new-actions-address-youth-mental-health-crisis,Fact Sheet: Biden-Harris Administration Announces Two New Actions to Address Youth Mental Health Crisis,"Our nation's young people are facing an unprecedented mental health crisis. Even before the pandemic, rates of depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts among youth were on the rise. The pandemic exacerbated those issues, disrupting learning, relationships, and routines and increasing isolation—especially among our nation's young people. More than 40 percent of teenagers state that they struggle with persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness, and more than half of parents and caregivers express concern over their children's mental well-being. To address this crisis, President Biden put forward in his first State of the Union a comprehensive national strategy to tackle our mental health crisis, and called for a major transformation in how mental health is understood, accessed, treated, and integrated—in and out of health care settings. Today, the Biden-Harris Administration announced two new actions to strengthen school-based mental health services and address the youth mental health crisis. 1. Awarding the first of nearly $300 million the President secured through the FY2022 bipartisan omnibus agreement to expand access to mental health services in schools. Next week, the Department of Education will begin the process to disburse almost $300 million Congress appropriated in FY22 through both the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act and the FY22 Omnibus to help schools hire more school-based mental health professionals and build a strong pipeline into the profession for the upcoming school year. In total, the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act will invest $1 billion over the next five years in mental health supports in our schools, making progress towards the President's goal to double the number of school counselors, social workers, and other mental health professionals. This funding is allocated to two critical programs: The Mental Health Service Professional (MHSP) Demonstration Grant Program. In FY22, this program will provide over $140 million in competitive grants to support a strong pipeline into the mental health profession, including innovative partnerships to prepare qualified school-based mental health services providers for employment in schools. School-Based Mental Health (SBMH) Services Grant Program. In FY22, this program will provide over $140 million in competitive grants to states and school districts to increase the number of qualified mental health services providers delivering school-based mental health services to students in local educational agencies with demonstrated need. This will increase the number of school psychologists, counselors, and other mental health professionals serving our students. Some schools will gain mental health staff for the first time. Others will see this critical workforce expand. By increasing the number of qualified mental health professionals in our schools, and thereby reducing the number of students each provider serves, this program will meaningfully improve access to mental health services for vulnerable students. In the following months, the Biden Administration will deliver the following additional FY22 funding that can be used to expand access to mental health services and supports in schools: Fostering Trauma-Informed Services in Schools . Young people have been especially impacted by the trauma of COVID. Over the next several weeks, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will begin evaluating applications to award nearly $7 million to education activities designed to help students access evidence-based and culturally relevant trauma support services and mental health care. Applications were submitted on July 25, 2022, and award announcements will be made this fall. The grant funds will help create partnerships that link school systems with local trauma-informed support and mental health systems to provide services to students in need. Expanding Mental Health Services Through Full-Service Community Schools. The Biden-Harris Administration has proposed expanding funding for community schools, which play a critical role in providing comprehensive services to students and families to improve academic outcomes and student well-being. In response to the President's FY22 budget, Congress more than doubled funding for the Department of Education's Full-Service Community Schools Program, which supports community schools that provide, or establish partnerships to provide, a range of wraparound supports for students and their families—including health, nutrition, and mental health services. Earlier this month, the Department announced plans to award $68 million in funds for 40 new grantees. All grantees are required to provide integrated student services, which can include mental health services and supports. Responding to Childhood Trauma Associated with Community Violence. The FY22 omnibus included $5 million for the Department of Education's Project Prevent, a program that provides grants to help school districts increase their capacity to implement community- and school-based strategies to mitigate community violence and the impacts on students. Experiencing or witnessing violence in the community is an adverse childhood experience linked to chronic health issues, including mental health. Project Prevent seeks to build a bridge between schools and community-based organizations to provide students with the tools to break cycles of generational violence and trauma, including through the use of mental health services and supports. 2. Encouraging Governors to Invest More in School-Based Mental Health Services. In a letter sent today to governors across the country, the Departments of Education and Health and Human Services highlight federal resources available to states and schools to invest in mental health services for students. The joint letter from Secretaries Becerra and Cardona highlights actions by the Biden-Harris Administration to improve the delivery of health care in schools and make sure children enrolled in Medicaid have access to comprehensive health care services, as required by law. The letter also previews forthcoming Medicaid guidance on how states can leverage Medicaid funding to deliver critical mental health care services to more students, including ways to make it easier to bill Medicaid for these services. Next Up: $1.7 Billion for Mental Health Thanks to the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act An additional $1.7 billion for mental health is headed to our schools and communities thanks to the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA) signed by President Biden last month. Provisions of this legislation authorize funding and technical assistance in the following areas: Expanding Community Based Behavioral Health Services . $40 million for HHS to support the Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic (CCBHC) Medicaid Demonstration Program, including support for new planning grants to states. CCBHCs provide comprehensive, coordinated, person-and family-centered services and 24/7 crisis intervention services. Enhancing Delivery of School-Based Mental Health. Working with the Department of Education, HHS will establish a technical assistance center and award grants for implementing, enhancing, or expanding the provision of assistance through schools under Medicaid and CHIP. Improving Oversight of Medicaid's Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment Benefit. HHS will review and identify gaps in state implementation of ESPDT compliance, provide technical assistance, and issue guidance to states in order to improve implementation of this critical benefit. Increasing Access to Children's Mental Health Services . $80 million to HHS to award grants to support pediatric primary care providers, emergency departments, and schools to rapidly access mental health specialists' expertise and better connect children to care. The Act also requires CMS to provide guidance to states on how they can increase access to behavioral health through telehealth under Medicaid and CHIP. Expanding Training for Pediatric Providers. $60 million, over five years, for HHS to train primary care residents in the prevention, treatment, and referral of services for mental and behavioral health conditions for pediatric and adolescents. Supporting Community and First Responders Mental Health Training . $120 million for HHS to prepare and train community members and first responders on how to appropriately recognize and safely respond to individuals with mental health problems. Building Awareness of and Access to Mental Health Services . $240 million for programs that increase awareness and access to mental health supports for school-aged youth. Providing Support after Traumatic Events. $40 million to improve treatment and services for children, adolescents, and families who have experienced traumatic events. Enhancing the 9-8-8 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline . $150 million to support implementation of the 24/7 hotline to provide free and confidential support to people in suicidal crisis or emotional distress. Improving Conditions for Student Learning. $1 billion in funding through Title IV-A to support a variety of activities to improve conditions for student learning through evidence-based practices to promote positive school climates. Expanding Access to Out of School Programs . $50 million in funding to the 21st Century Community Learning Centers (21st CCLC) program to fund extracurricular, after school and summer programs, with a focus on reengaging youth. The Department of Education will support grantees in using funds to build relationships between students and educators, and other adults who serve students, in ways that help students feel less isolated and more connected to their school, improving their overall mental health and well-being. Building on Progress These actions build upon earlier investments and announcements designed to expand access to mental health services for youth and further President Biden's Unity Agenda. In just 18 months, President Biden has invested unprecedented resources in addressing the mental health crisis and providing young people the supports, resources, and care they need. Through the American Rescue Plan (ARP), the Biden-Harris Administration has invested over $5 billion in funding through HHS to expand access to mental health and substance use services, and school districts are estimated to use an additional $2 billion in Department of Education ARP Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief funds to hire more school psychologists, counselors, and other mental health professionals in K-12 schools. And the President's FY23 budget proposes over $27 billion in discretionary funding and another $100 billion in mandatory funding over 10 years to implement his national mental health strategy."

These funds will help meet the needs of students and educators and can be used for supports including mental health services, academic recovery, educator professional development, and community and family partnerships. Funding from the American Rescue Plan is also helping to boost compensation for educators in Puerto Rico. Beginning this month, public school teachers on the island started receiving a $1,000 monthly salary increase that was made possible through the critical federal funding. This is a 30 percent increase for the average teacher in Puerto Rico. ""One year ago, I met with Secretary Ramos Parés for the first time to discuss the collaborative and transparent work that we envisioned to serve students in Puerto Rico. Since that day we haven't stopped working to ensure that every student across the island has their fair shot at success and for our teachers to be treated with the respect and dignity that they deserve,"" said Secretary Cardona. ""I'm confident that we will continue to work together as partners, for the students and educators of Puerto Rico and for the future of the island."" Secretaries Cardona and Ramos Parés were joined by Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Federal Disaster Recovery Coordinator Jose G. Baquero Tirado, and Ponce Regional Superintendent Dr. Roberto J. Rodríguez Santiago at Escuela Superior Dr. Pila to celebrate the beginning of the school's reconstruction. Escuela Superior Dr. Pila has been closed for over two years due to infrastructure damage and is one of the largest schools in the southern region of Puerto Rico to be disproportionately impacted by recent earthquakes. FEMA has obligated over $700,000 to the Puerto Rico Department of Education (PRDE) to support the reconstruction of Escuela Superior Dr. Pila. Earlier this year, the Department of Education (Department) also approved PRDE's use of ARP funds for short column repairs at schools impacted by natural disasters. This funding is helping to accelerate repairs that will make schools and classrooms safer and accessible for educators and students. Since Secretary Cardona's last visit to Puerto Rico in July 2021, over 275 schools have had short column repairs completed. The Department continues to provide additional technical assistance to guide PRDE's management of federal education programs and funds. Additionally, the Department is continuing formal listening sessions across the island to hear the needs of students, parents, educators, and stakeholders. These listening sessions will result in a Memorandum of Understanding to ensure that transparency remains at the forefront of the collaboration between the departments. ""We have worked with the U.S. Department of education to strengthen our educational programs, support our staff with better technology and instructional tools, and equip our students with more resources for an optimal learning experience,"" said Puerto Rico Department of Education Secretary Eliezer Ramos Parés. ""We continue to face the infrastructure challenges of our campuses, managing the distribution of the federal funds and guaranteeing their proper use. I appreciate the support of Secretary Cardona and his team and I'm confident that communication between us will remain open and we'll be proactive to provide an educational system that meets the needs of our students."" ""FEMA remains committed to the Island's reconstruction after the hurricanes of 2017 and the 2020 earthquakes. Schools are a core part of the island's socioeconomic development and that is why we are allocating funds for facilities that will train our future leaders. Obligated funds for these schools will not only build back better: they will also mitigate risks from future natural disasters,"" said the Federal Disaster Recovery Coordinator for FEMA in Puerto Rico, José G. Baquero. Since day one, the Biden-Harris Administration has been committed to ensuring that students on the island have equal opportunities at success and the resources needed to fully recover academically from the impacts of the pandemic. Today's actions complement steps the Administration has taken to continue supporting education outcomes for students in Puerto Rico. As of July 2022, the Department has released nearly $6 billion to the PRDE including: $2.9 billion from the American Rescue Plan Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund (ARP ESSER) and Homeless Children and Youth (ARP HCY); $1.9 billion from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act); Governor's Emergency Education Relief Fund (GEER Fund); Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2021 (CRRSA Act); and $1 billion in FY 2021 and FY 2022 program grants."
25-Jul-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/education-department-releases-proposed-regulations-protect-veterans-and-service-members-increase-college-oversight-and-increase-college-access-incarcerated-individuals,"Education Department Releases Proposed Regulations to Protect Veterans and Service Members, Increase College Oversight, and Increase College Access for Incarcerated Individuals","Today, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) released proposed regulations that would implement critical changes in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 that better protect veterans and service members from being subject to aggressive targeting practices by requiring private for-profit institutions to obtain at least 10 percent of revenue from non-federal sources. This is a change from current practice, in which institutions can count federal aid for veterans and service members to meet the 10 percent revenue test. The proposed rules would also strengthen the requirements for institutions undergoing changes in ownership, including with respect to for-profit institutions seeking to convert to nonprofit status. These ownership conversions have been flagged by the U.S. Government Accountability Office as a source of concerning institutional behavior. Finally, the proposed rules would clarify how incarcerated individuals can begin to access Pell Grants for qualifying prison education programs operated by public and nonprofit institutions. ""Predatory, deceptive practices that target veterans and servicemembers have no place in higher education, period,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""The Biden-Harris Administration believes educating our veterans and service members should be about honoring their contributions to our country, not exploiting them for financial gain. These proposed regulations enact welcome changes by Congress to better protect students who have served, and continue to serve, our nation. These rules will also ensure that efforts by for-profit colleges to convert to nonprofit status are genuine changes, not mere ploys to evade accountability to students and taxpayers."" This regulatory package is the latest step in the Biden-Harris Administration's continued commitment to ensure that institutions are held accountable and that all students have access to a valuable postsecondary education. The proposed regulations, which were negotiated by two committees of stakeholders last year, reflect significant input from the community, and consensus agreements among negotiators. ""These proposed regulations are a milestone in the Biden-Harris Administration's ambitious regulatory agenda, both with respect to accountability and oversight of colleges, particularly for-profit colleges,"" said James Kvaal, Under Secretary of Education. ""Today, we take the next step toward addressing some of the most significant and pervasive problems in higher education, including unscrupulous recruiting of veterans and abuses of the change of ownership process. We are committed to finalizing these regulations expeditiously and turning to the work yet to come."" ""Prison education programs bring hope to incarcerated students and their families and help prepare people for meaningful jobs and careers when they return home to our communities,"" said Amy Loyd, Assistant Secretary for the Office of Career, Technical, and Adult Education. ""These proposed regulations will help to provide critical opportunities to students in prison and support the institutions working to serve them."" The proposed regulations will be officially published in the Federal Register in the coming days, and the public is invited to provide comment for 30 days after the official publication through Regulations.gov. The Department expects to finalize the rules later this year so they take effect no later than July 1, 2023. The rules would make considerable improvements in the U.S. higher education system, including: Strengthening the ""90/10"" rule for for-profit colleges. For-profit institutions have long been required by the Higher Education Act to obtain at least 10 percent of their revenue from sources other than federal student aid provided by the Department (e.g., Pell Grants and federal student loans). The American Rescue Plan Act that President Biden signed into law requires that at least 10 percent of funds come from sources other than any federal education assistance—not just aid awarded by the Department. The proposed regulations would be a change from current practice, in which institutions can count federal aid for veterans and service members to meet the 10 percent revenue test. Prior to the proposed change, a loophole led some institutions to aggressively target these populations because every $1 brought in from these students mean they could receive $9 more in Department of Education aid without needing to secure any private investment. These proposed regulations, on which negotiators reached consensus, would codify this statutory change and ensure for-profit institutions are not overly reliant on taxpayer-financed aid. The proposed changes would also strengthen the 90/10 calculation by ensuring institutions cannot evade the metric, including by counting revenue from the sale of institutional loans, income-share agreements, or similar alternative financing options. Clarifying procedures for institutions undergoing changes in ownership, including those converting from for-profit to nonprofit status. A growing number of institutions now undergo often-complex changes in ownership transactions, leading the U.S. Government Accountability Office to raise warnings that many of these conversions involved continued ""insider involvement,"" presenting risks to students and taxpayers. The Department sought to clarify the requirements and processes institutions must follow in order to expand protections for students and taxpayers. The proposed regulations would clarify the definition of a nonprofit institution to prevent improper financial benefits to a former owner or other affiliate of a college. Additionally, institutions undergoing a change in ownership would be required to notify both the Department and the institution's students at least 90 days prior to the change to ensure advance notice is provided. Institutions undergoing a change in ownership may also be required to provide additional financial protection or to comply with additional conditions to protect against the risk of the transaction. Extending Pell Grants to incarcerated individuals. Postsecondary programs offered in correctional facilities have been demonstrated to increase students' skills, improve employment outcomes, and reduce recidivism. Congress recently established eligibility for Pell Grants for incarcerated individuals enrolled in qualifying programs. These proposed regulations, on which negotiators reached consensus, would ensure that state departments of corrections, the Federal Bureau of Prisons, or another entity, as appropriate, fairly assess institutions' eligibility to offer prison education programs based on the best interests of the students and with the input of affected stakeholders; clarify requirements for such prison education programs; and ensure transparency and data to demonstrate how well these programs are serving their students. The changes will take effect July 1, 2023. In the interim, the Department expanded its Second Chance Pell program under the Experimental Sites Initiative to serve incarcerated individuals in nearly every state. An Agenda for Equitable Postsecondary Education The changes proposed today are a continuation of the Department's commitment to protecting students and taxpayers and building a stronger, more accessible higher education system. The Department launched negotiations on affordability and student loan issues with a series of public hearings in June 2021 and released the first set of proposed rules from those negotiations on July 6, 2022. This proposed rule includes negotiators' consensus agreement on expanding access to Pell Grants to incarcerated students. Another proposed rule related to income-driven repayment is expected to be released in the near future. The Department also formed a rulemaking committee for issues related to ensuring accountability for colleges and programs that receive federal financial aid and completed negotiations in March 2022. These proposed rules include two of the key issues from that rulemaking—regulations governing the 90/10 rule and changes in ownership—with the remainder of the regulations expected to be released in early 2023. The Biden-Harris Administration has demonstrated a commitment to increased accountability, including by requiring entities that operate private colleges, particularly those with potential risk factors, to sign the agreements between colleges and the Department and to assume joint responsibility for any liabilities. These proposed rules, and others to come, will further ensure colleges are held financially accountable for their conduct. Additionally, the Biden-Harris Administration has already approved more than $27 billion in targeted student loan relief for nearly 1.4 million borrowers through executive action. The Department has also announced steps to remedy long-standing problems in the income-driven repayment plans that will help millions of borrowers move closer to debt forgiveness and tens of thousands more receive immediate forgiveness To view an unofficial copy of the proposed regulations, click here , and to view a fact sheet with more information, click here ."
22-Jul-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/secretary-cardona-congratulates-2022-presidents-education-awards-program-recipients,Secretary Cardona Congratulates 2022 President’s Education Awards Program Recipients,"U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona today congratulated the 2022 President’s Education Awards Program (PEAP) recipients, recognizing hundreds of thousands of elementary, middle, and high school graduates from public and private schools across all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Outlying Areas, and American military bases abroad on their educational accomplishments. As of mid-June, there had been nearly 75,000 unique downloads of 2022 PEAP materials, including Excellence and Achievement certificates and letters from the President and the Secretary. “I am thrilled to join President Biden in congratulating students whose determination, character, and talent have earned them the 2022 President’s Education Award,"" Secretary Cardona said. “The young people recognized this year went above and beyond in pursuit of their goals, triumphing over challenges and inspiring their teachers, peers, families, and communities with their remarkable resilience. These students should be immensely proud of their accomplishments, and I hope this award reminds them that the talents, skills, backgrounds, and dreams that make them unique will be their lifelong superpowers.” PEAP was founded in 1983. Every year since then, the program has provided schools with the opportunity to recognize graduating students who meet high standards of academic excellence and those who have given their best effort, often overcoming obstacles to their learning. Each year, eligible graduating K-12 students are selected by their school principals for recognition in one of two categories: The President’s Award for Educational Excellence – This award recognizes academic success in the classroom. To be eligible, students must meet requirements, including grade point average or other school-set criteria and choice of state tests or teacher recommendations. The President’s Award for Educational Achievement – This award recognizes students who show outstanding educational growth, improvement, commitment, or intellectual development in their academic subjects but do not meet the criteria for the Educational Excellence Award. Its purpose is to encourage and reward students who give their best effort, often in the face of obstacles. Criteria for this award are developed at each school. Individual recognition is bestowed by the President and the U.S. Secretary of Education, in partnership with the National Association of Elementary School Principals and the National Association of Secondary School Principals. The award includes a congratulatory letter to the student and a certificate signed by the President, the Secretary, and the school principal. Unlike other awards programs, the principal has sole discretion in choosing recipients based on eligibility. There is no limit on the number of awards that can be downloaded and printed, as long as students meet the criteria for each award set by the school. Despite the uncertainty and challenges related to COVID-19, the program continued to accept and fulfill nominations. This program year, due to global supply chain issues, the Department was unable to print hard copy program materials. Therefore, for the first time, the agency made available the Excellence and Achievement certificates, as well as congratulatory letters from the President and Secretary of Education, for download at https://www2.ed.gov/programs/presedaward/2022-materials.html . Also, PEAP-related products, such as folders, pins, and graduation cords, remain available to order from the National Association of Elementary School Principals at https://www.services-naesp.org/peap/t-main.aspx . A list of past school participation, by state and territory, is available here https://www2.ed.gov/programs/presedaward/awards.html ."

The grant will be used to support ongoing efforts that improve the safety and well-being of students, staff, and families at Oxford High School. These funds also will help to provide counseling and mental health services to students and school staff. “Helping school communities recover from gun violence takes time, compassion, and resources,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “This Project SERV grant will help Oxford High School improve mental health supports for students and educators directly impacted by the trauma and tragedy of last year’s mass shooting. As the Biden-Harris administration works to strengthen gun safety and implement the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act , the Department of Education remains as committed as ever to helping schools restore safe learning environments for all students.” Project SERV funds are authorized under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and may be used for activities that help restore a sense of safety and security for a district’s students, teachers, staff, and families, and that address specific needs of those individuals directly affected by tragic events. Such activities include mental health services for staff and students, and overtime pay for teachers, counselors, and security staff, and may take place over the summer in the form of additional summer programming. The Department’s Office of Safe and Supportive Schools (OSSS) contacted OACSD soon after the Nov. 30, 2021, incident to offer support. OSSS maintained communication with OACSD in the months following the incident to explore how Project SERV funds could best support the district and to provide technical assistance throughout the grant application process. The Department’s Readiness and Emergency Management for Schools Technical Assistance Center (REMS) builds the preparedness capacity (including prevention, protection, mitigation, response, and recovery efforts) of schools, school districts, colleges, and their community partners at the local, state, and federal levels; and serves as the primary source of information for schools, school districts, and colleges for emergencies. REMS has developed a variety of resources and trainings designed to offer schools a way to prevent and reduce targeted violence. The National Center on Safe and Supportive Learning Environments offers information and technical assistance focused on improving school climate and conditions for learning. Earlier this month, President Biden signed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act , which provides vital funding to address the youth mental health crisis in this country, including the trauma experienced by the survivors of gun violence.

20-Jul-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-invests-summer-learning-and-enrichment-programs-help-students-catch,FACT SHEET: Biden-Harris Administration Invests in Summer Learning and Enrichment Programs to Help Students Catch Up,"Summer learning and enrichment programs can play a critical role in student success. From providing students opportunities to catch up academically from what they may have missed during the pandemic to providing channels for students to engage with their peers, friends, and caring adults, summer programs across the country are helping students recover and thrive. President Biden has invested significantly in expanding summer programs for students and families across the nation, because he knows it is an essential ingredient in student recovery and success. Through President Biden’s American Rescue Plan (ARP), states and districts received $122 billion to help schools reopen and help students catch up academically and access mental health supports, including by increasing summer programming. As a result, all 50 states, Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico, are investing in summer learning and enrichment offerings, providing more opportunities for students – especially those disproportionately impacted by the pandemic – to benefit academically and socially from these programs. Further elevating the importance of high-quality summer learning programs, President Biden has called on schools to use American Rescue Plan funds to provide high-quality summer learning programs – as well as tutoring and afterschool programs – at the scale needed to support, on average, an additional four months of learning gains in reading and math. Starting today, First Lady Jill Biden and Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona embark on a tour across the country to amplify that call and highlight how the Biden-Harris Administration is helping students catch up academically through summer learning programs supported by the American Rescue Plan. Summer learning and enrichment programming is among the top strategies school districts are using to address missed instruction – and the American Rescue Plan is funding it. President Biden’s American Rescue Plan provided states and districts with $122 billion to help schools reopen and help students recover academically and access the mental health supports they need. States were also required to set aside over $1 billion in funding to invest in summer programs, because summer is an important time for students to reengage with their peers and teachers, catch up academically from missed instruction, and get the social, emotional, and mental health supports they need. Local school districts plan to spend $27 billion of American Rescue Plan funds on academic recovery. According to a June analysis by Future Ed, school districts across the country plan to spend $27 billion on academic recovery, second only to investments in staffing to help students recover from the pandemic and thrive. The American Rescue Plan requires districts to spend 20% of their ARP Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) funds on academic recovery, but according to the analysis, districts are planning to spend more than the required percentage – at least 25% – to help more students catch up academically. Districts are also planning to spend an additional 23% of their ARP funds on staffing – which will play a critical role in helping students recover academically and access the supports they need. Summer learning is among the top strategies school districts are using to provide additional academic instruction. The Future Ed analysis also found that summer learning and afterschool programs make up nearly a quarter of the academic recovery investments. Its analysis projects"
19-Jul-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/new-guidance-helps-schools-support-students-disabilities-and-avoid-discriminatory-use-discipline,New Guidance Helps Schools Support Students with Disabilities and Avoid Discriminatory Use of Discipline,"New guidance released today from the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) and Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS) helps public elementary and secondary schools fulfill their responsibilities to meet the needs of students with disabilities and avoid the discriminatory use of student discipline. These newly released resources are the most comprehensive guidance on the civil rights of students with disabilities concerning student discipline and build on the Department’s continued efforts to support students and schools through pandemic recovery. ""All students deserve to have their rights protected, and schools deserve greater clarity on how they can avoid the discriminatory use of discipline, "" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""Too often, students with disabilities face harsh and exclusionary disciplinary action at school. The guidance we’re releasing today will help ensure that students with disabilities are treated fairly and have access to supports and services to meet their needs – including their disability-based behavior. We also expect that districts utilize the federal American Rescue Plan dollars to build capacity, provide professional learning opportunities for educators and school leaders, and hire additional staff. These resources will also help schools live up to their legal obligations, support an equitable recovery for all our students, and make sure that students with disabilities get the behavioral supports and special education services they need to thrive. "" The new resources reflect the concern, particularly in light of the prevalence of student mental health issues associated with the pandemic, that some students with disabilities are not receiving the supports and services necessary to address their educational needs, including their disability-based behavior. The guidance makes clear that schools do not need to choose between complying with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504) and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and keeping their school community – including students and staff – safe. The new resources include: Supporting Students with Disabilities and Avoiding the Discriminatory Use of Student Discipline under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and an accompanying Fact Sheet . Questions and Answers Addressing the Needs of Children with Disabilities and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act's (IDEA's) Discipline Provisions . Positive, Proactive Approaches to Supporting the Needs of Children with Disabilities: A Guide for Stakeholders . And, A letter from Secretary Cardona to our nation's educators, school leaders, parents, and students about the importance of supporting the needs of students with disabilities. In developing today’s guidance and resources, the Department drew from experience with enforcing and administering federal laws relating to students with disabilities, including Section 504 and the IDEA. The Department also considered information shared by members of the public in response to the June 2021 Request for Information Regarding the Nondiscriminatory Administration of School Discipline. Section 504 prohibits recipients of federal financial assistance from discriminating based on disability, and the IDEA guarantees that children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education (FAPE). FAPE emphasizes special education and related services designed to the needs of children with disabilities and prepare them for further education and employment services and independent living. Supporting Students and Avoiding the Discriminatory Use of Discipline under Section 504 Supporting Students with Disabilities and Avoiding the Discriminatory Use of Student Discipline under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 explains that Section 504 requires schools to provide behavioral supports and services to students with disabilities who need them in order to receive a FAPE. ""Today’s crucial guidance outlines how schools can effectively support and respond to behavior that is based on a student’s disability and could lead to student discipline, in addition to explaining schools' civil rights responsibilities related to disability when administering student discipline"" said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon. ""We will continue to vigorously enforce federal civil rights laws to ensure that all students have equal access to educational opportunities. "" The new guidance makes clear that providing the individualized services and supports required by Section 504 can help prevent or reduce disability-based behaviors that might otherwise lead to student discipline. Additionally, the guidance: Outlines how Section 504’s requirements to provide a FAPE apply to long-term disciplinary sanctions, such as out-of-school suspensions and expulsions. Explains Section 504’s general nondiscrimination requirements, in the context of discipline, which applies to school staff and to the conduct of everyone with whom the school has a contractual or other arrangement, such as security staff and school police. Makes clear that Section 504 requires schools to provide reasonable modifications to policies, practices, and procedures when necessary to avoid discrimination. Section 504 does not prohibit a school from responding to emergency circumstances, such as contacting law enforcement or crisis intervention specialists, or from taking appropriate, nondiscriminatory steps to maintain safety and support students in learning how to be accountable for the impact of their actions on others. Supporting the Needs of Children with Disabilities and IDEA’s Discipline Provisions Questions and Answers Addressing the Needs of Children with Disabilities and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act's (IDEA's) Discipline Provisions and Positive, Proactive Approaches to Supporting the Needs of Children with Disabilities: A Guide for Stakeholders expand upon the 2016 Dear Colleague Letter that included data demonstrating that many children with disabilities, particularly Black children with disabilities, were subjected to high rates of disciplinary removals (such as suspensions and expulsions). Today’s resources underscore that children can experience academic success with an appropriately developed and effectively implemented individualized education program (IEP). IDEA includes specific provisions to address situations in which the behavior of a child with a disability impedes the child’s learning, the learning of others, or violates a school’s code of student conduct. Importantly, as part of the obligation to provide FAPE, in the case of a child whose behavior impedes the child’s learning or that of others, the IEP Team must consider – and include in the IEP – the use of positive behavioral interventions and supports, and other strategies, to address that behavior. ""These resources are intended to assist state educational agencies (SEAs) with supporting local educational agencies (LEAs) and schools in addressing the needs of children with disabilities and equitably and appropriately implementing IDEA, "" said Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services Katy Neas. ""These documents can assist students and families in understanding their rights under IDEA and provide SEAs, LEAs, and educators resources to fulfill their obligations to appropriately meet the needs of children with disabilities. Together, we can reduce the use of exclusionary discipline for children with disabilities and ensure every child has access to an educational environment that is nondiscriminatory, supportive, positive, and safe for all.

The Initiative will help communities utilize American Rescue Plan funds alongside other state and local funds to ensure that every child who wants a spot in a high-quality out-of-school time (OST) program has one. This announcement coincides with National Summer Learning Week. ""Quality out-of-school time programs have always supported students' academic, social, and emotional growth, but as we recover from the pandemic, these opportunities have never mattered more,"" said Secretary Miguel Cardona. ""We need bold action, especially for low-income students and students of color who have historically struggled to access quality afterschool programs and rich summer learning experiences. This new partnership cements the Department of Education's commitment to ensuring that more students have access to meaningful, enriching out-of-school programming, not just some of the day, but all day, all year round."" The U.S. Department of Education is announcing a public-private partnership with five coordinating organizations: the Afterschool Alliance, The National Comprehensive Center, the National League of Cities, The National Summer Learning Association, and AASA, the School Superintendents Association who will work with more than 20 allied organizations to ensure that students have access to these critical learning and development opportunities year-round. The Initiative will encourage and support schools, districts, local elected officials, local government agencies, community-based organizations, states, and others connected to out-of-school time efforts to take up ED’s call to action on universal access, and to encourage the utilization of American Rescue Plan resources in addition to other federal, state, and local resources to support access to out-of-school time as an evidence-based strategy to support student recovery from lost instructional time during the pandemic. The National partners will provide coordinated support by organizing the technical assistance offerings in one centralized, readily available location to navigate for those who are not familiar with particular interventions or programs. Secretary Cardona will make the announcement in opening remarks at an Engage Every Student event today at the U.S. Department of Education. This will be followed by pre-recorded remarks by U.S. Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh and panels that include educational leaders from various partner organizations. Following the program, students from high schools and colleges from across the country, will participate in the event and in an ice cream social. The event will conclude with closing remarks from U.S. Deputy Secretary of Education Cindy Marten. A livestream of the event can be found here . ""At the Department of Labor, we are committed to providing young people with workforce opportunities that put them on the road to success. I am proud of programs such as Workforce Pathways for Youth, as well as the Department of Education’s Engage Every Student Initiative, that expand summer jobs, career exploration, apprenticeships, and so much more. I am grateful for the partnerships—in and out of government—that make this work possible,"" said U.S. Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh. This announcement builds on the more than two decades of work to build and grow the 21st Century Community Learning Center Initiative that began in 1997. Now through the American Rescue Plan funds, schools and districts are further able to expand access to out-of-school time programs that support student learning and have lasting, positive impacts on youth development. Today, the Department is also announcing new resources to support out-of-school time including: A $3-4 million dollar contract that will be awarded in FY2023 to provide best practices in program implementation for summer and out-of-school time. A new tool from the Institute of Education Sciences to support states, districts or programs in building and using evidence to implement afterschool and summer learning programs. This tool is part of IES’ Evidence-based Practices for Renewal and Recovery , which curates evidence, tools, and other materials from a wide range of sources—showcasing the use of evidence-based practices in this period of recovery and renewal to improve outcomes for all learners, especially those that education systems have historically underserved. Importantly, this initiative centers on elevating and expanding quality out-of-school time programs. Quality out-of-school time programs are well-planned and well-implemented and center opportunities for enrichment and social engagement alongside academic achievement, helping students build connections to their peers and in their schools.

The grants will assist students who attend 244 colleges and universities and provides resources to help these institutions recover from the impacts of the pandemic. The American Rescue Plan, signed by President Biden in March 2021, provided almost $40 billion in relief funds to colleges and universities, directly helping thousands of students impacted by the pandemic. The grants have been awarded to public and private non-profit colleges and universities that have the greatest unmet needs, including community colleges and rural institutions that serve a high percentage of diverse student populations and low-income students, and those that have experienced enrollment declines since the start of the pandemic, among other categories. Of the funds awarded today, almost 90 percent will go toward Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs), community colleges, rural institutions, and institutions serving large populations of low-income students. The majority of institutions are also required to distribute roughly half of all grant funds directly to students with the greatest need, which helps provide additional support for housing, tuition support, addressing food insecurity, and other basic needs. ""The institutions that serve our highest-need students were not only hit hard by the pandemic, but in many cases have also struggled with chronic underinvestment and funding inequities,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""This funding from the American Rescue Plan will help HBCUs, MSIs, community colleges, and other inclusive institutions better support their students, from investing in campus mental health, to providing financial relief, to meeting housing, transportation, and child care needs. When we invest in stronger supports for our students, we help remove barriers to their success so that they can stay on track with their studies, complete their degrees, and ultimately, build rewarding careers."" As part of the announcement, Secretary Miguel Cardona, First Lady Jill Biden, and American Rescue Plan Coordinator Gene Sperling will join leadership from the Community College of Philadelphia, Coahoma Community College, and Southwestern Michigan College for a press call to highlight the positive impacts these grants have had on their students and institutions. These colleges have spent funds reducing or eliminating tuition, eliminating outstanding student balances, addressing food insecurity by supporting a food pantry, creating a zero-cost textbook program, and covering costs of evidence-based practices to monitor and suppress the spread of Covid-19. The Biden-Harris Administration has made unprecedented investments through ARP in many of our nation’s historic or under-resourced institutions that educate students whose communities were most acutely affected by the pandemic. These investments include more than $10 billion to community colleges, over $2.6 billion to HBCUs, approximately $190 million to TCUs, and more than $13 billion to MSIs such as Hispanic-Serving Institutions and Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institutions. ARP funds more than doubled the higher education grants that were made available under previous pandemic relief bills. The Biden-Harris Administration remains committed to ensuring recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Today’s announcement highlights the Administration’s commitment to supporting our nation’s most under-resourced institutions in preventing, preparing for, and responding to the pandemic. In addition to funds providing emergency financial aid to students, institutional funds can be used to provide basic needs support, expand mental healthcare, create retention programs, and monitor and suppress the spread of Covid-19 among other initiatives designed to respond to the pandemic.

12-Jul-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/education-department-announces-68-million-grants-support-students-through-full-service-community-schools,Education Department Announces $68 Million in Grants to Support Students Through Full-Service Community Schools,"Today, the U.S. Department of Education released a Notice Inviting Applications for the Full-Service Community Schools (FSCS) grant program that provides academic support and strengthens connections among schools, parents and families, and their surrounding communities. This program aligns with the priorities and vision set forth by the Biden-Harris Administration and U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona in support of high-quality educational opportunities for all students. Full-service community schools play an important role in providing academic supports, integrated health and social services, and engagement opportunities to students while also creating stronger connections between families, communities, and their local public schools. These priorities align with the Biden-Harris Administration’s work to scale evidence-based approaches to support students’ academic, social, emotional, and physical well-being. President Biden requested Congress increase funding for the FSCS Program to $468 million in his fiscal year 2023 budget. ""When we invest in Full-Service Community Schools, we invest in the success of students, the well-being of families, and the strength of entire communities,"" said Secretary Miguel Cardona. ""These grants will help community schools provide quality wraparound services to students and their families, from access to health care and nutritional assistance, to tutoring and enrichment opportunities, to mental health supports and violence prevention programs. For low-income rural and urban communities hit hard by the pandemic, Full-Service Community Schools will help us meet the holistic needs of students, drive our recovery, and pave the way to a more equitable future."" The Department released the Notice of Final Priorities , definitions, and requirements for the FSCS competitive grant program as well as the Notice Inviting Applications . The program will award $68 million to support community schools across the country. Through this commitment, the Department will help spur the planning and capacity-building, development, implementation, operation, and coordination of effective services for children and families, particularly in urban and rural areas with high rates of poverty. The Full-Service Community Schools Program requires grantees to provide a continuum of coordinated supports to students that include social, health, nutrition, and mental health services and supports. The new program priorities emphasize quality implementation of the four pillars of community schools: integrated student supports that address out-of-school barriers to learning through partnerships with social and health service agencies and providers; expanded and enriched learning time and opportunities; active family and community engagement; and collabortive leadership and practices. Additionally, three priorities were included to assist in scaling programs from their capacity-building or developmental phase to district and statewide phases. Recognizing the impact of school and community safety on learning, the Department is also interested in applications that are coordinating across multiple agencies and organizations to address community violence prevention and intervention.

11-Jul-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/statement-us-secretary-education-miguel-cardona-bipartisan-safer-communities-act,Statement from U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona on the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act,"U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona issued the below statement following a White House event commemorating the passage of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act: “The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act is an important step toward addressing years of inaction and indifference in response to heartbreaking gun violence in our schools and communities. At the U.S. Department of Education, we will work diligently to invest more than $2 billion provided under this law to improve mental health supports for students and expand access to school-based health services. We also will assist states and districts in using these resources to invest in evidence-based practices that support safe schools. And thanks to months of conversations already underway between my team and our colleagues at the Department of Health and Human Services, the Biden-Harris Administration has a head start on efforts to break down barriers faced by school-based health providers in delivering mental health supports and services to students in need. Educators, families, students, and communities should be full partners in the implementation of this bill. While this legislation won’t stop every act of gun violence in our country, it provides more tools to toughen background checks, prevent needless tragedies, and save lives. I thank the countless students, families, and educators who continue to stand together to call for change, and commend those in Congress with the courage to answer President Biden’s call for action. Now it’s time to get to work.”"
6-Jul-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/education-department-releases-proposed-regulations-expand-and-improve-targeted-relief-programs,Education Department Releases Proposed Regulations to Expand and Improve Targeted Relief Programs,"Today, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) released proposed regulations that would expand and improve the major student loan discharge programs authorized by the Higher Education Act. The regulations propose to alleviate student loan debt burdens for borrowers whose schools closed or lied to them, who are totally and permanently disabled, and for public service workers who have met their commitments under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program. The regulations also propose stopping many instances of interest capitalization, which occur when unpaid interest is added to a borrower’s principal balance, increasing the total amount they owe. Finally, the regulations propose to give borrowers their day in court if they have disputes with their colleges. Today’s proposals build upon the work the Biden-Harris Administration has already done to improve the student loan program, make college more affordable, and deliver tens of billions of dollars in relief to over one million student loan borrowers across the country. “We are committed to fixing a broken system. If a borrower qualifies for student loan relief, it shouldn’t take mountains of paperwork or a law degree to obtain it,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “Student loan benefits also should not be so hard to get that borrowers never actually benefit from them. The Biden-Harris Administration is determined to build a more accessible, affordable, and accountable student loan system. These proposed regulations will protect borrowers and save them time, money, and frustration, and will hold their colleges responsible for wrongdoing.” This regulatory package is part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s continued commitment to making student loan programs work, including delivering targeted relief to eligible borrowers and ensuring they have an affordable and effective path out of debt. The Administration’s efforts to date have resulted in the approval of nearly $26 billion for more than 1.3 million federal student loan borrowers, more than any other Administration in history. When finalized, these proposed regulations would establish lasting improvements to federal student loan programs that address concerns the Department has heard from borrowers and experts throughout the regulatory process. “We’ve heard from borrowers who have faced roadblocks when attempting to pursue the loan relief they’ve earned or are entitled to,” said James Kvaal, Under Secretary of Education. “Whether it is for closed school discharges, borrower defense claims, PSLF, or relief after a total and permanent disability, borrowers have had to navigate narrow rules and a needlessly complicated system. What’s worse, borrowers whose schools lied to them can’t pursue litigation because restrictive and unfair arbitration requirements and class action bans were foisted on them by their colleges. Borrowers should not have to jump through hoops to get the relief they deserve. The regulations we’ve proposed today would remove many of those barriers and help create a federal student loan system that works better for borrowers.” The proposed regulations will be published in the coming days and the public is invited to comment on the proposed regulations for 30 days. The Department aims to finalize these rules by November 1 of this year, meaning they will take effect no later than July 1, 2023. The rules propose needed and critical improvements to the student loan system including: Borrower defense to repayment and arbitration The proposed regulations would create a fair path for borrowers to receive a discharge if their colleges lied to or took advantage of them. This includes allowing for group claims, eliminating overly strict limits on when borrowers can file a claim, expanding the type of misconduct that can lead to an approved claim to include aggressive and deceptive recruitment practices, and ensuring borrowers receive timely decisions about their claims. To curb predatory behavior by colleges, the Department proposes a strong process for recouping the costs of such discharges from the college, running for at least six years following the borrower’s last date of attendance at the school. The Department also proposes ensuring that borrowers whose schools take advantage of them be allowed their day in court, by prohibiting colleges from requiring borrowers to sign mandatory pre-dispute arbitration agreements or class-action waivers. Additional transparency into arbitration proceedings that do occur will help the Department investigate possible wrongdoing. PSLF The Department proposes to make it easier for borrowers working in public service to gain progress toward forgiveness. Specifically, the Department proposes allowing more payments to qualify for PSLF including partial, lump sum, and late payments, and allowing certain kinds of deferments and forbearances (such as those for Peace Corps and AmeriCorps service, National Guard duty, and military service) to count toward PSLF. The Department also proposes to ensure the rules work better for non-tenured instructors whose colleges need to calculate their full-time employment. It also seeks comments on how best to consider the eligibility for PSLF of doctors providing services at nonprofit hospitals in states that prohibit their direct employment by that hospital and employees of for-profit early education programs that are licensed and regulated. The Department also proposes to create a formal reconsideration process in the regulations for borrowers whose applications are denied. These proposed regulatory changes would build on parts of the limited PSLF waiver that the Department announced in October 2021. That waiver allows borrowers to count all their payments toward PSLF, provides for an automatic reconsideration process for borrowers whose payments or applications were previously denied, and provides for some automatic application of credit towards forgiveness. However, not all of the limited PSLF waiver provisions are included in the proposed regulations due to statutory restrictions. Borrowers seeking to count their payments on Federal Family Education Loans toward forgiveness should apply for PSLF before October 31, 2022. Interest capitalization The Department proposes to protect borrowers from seeing their balances balloon by removing instances of interest capitalization wherever it is not required by statute. Interest capitalization occurs when accrued interest is added to the principal balance of the loan, so that future interest accrues on a higher amount. The Department proposes to eliminate capitalization when a borrower enters repayment, exits forbearance, defaults on a student loan, and exits most of the income-driven repayment plans. These changes will help borrowers who struggle to repay their loans. Total and permanent disability discharges The proposed regulations would help more borrowers who are totally and permanently disabled receive and keep the discharge they are entitled to under the law. The proposed regulations would allow for a broader set of disability statuses recognized by the Social Security Administration (SSA) to qualify for discharge, eliminate the three-year income-monitoring period for borrowers who receive discharges based upon a determination by a physician or SSA, and widen the types of documentation and signatures borrowers may submit to demonstrate they are eligible for relief. The Department is particularly concerned that the income monitoring requirements have caused far too many borrowers to lose their discharges even though they still have low incomes. Closed school discharges In recent years, the Department has seen a significant number of college closures, and often these schools leave borrowers holding debt but no degree. Many of those borrowers default on their loans after the closure. The proposed regulations provide automatic discharges to any borrower who was enrolled within 180 days prior to the closure and who didn’t complete their education at the school or via an approved teach-out agreement at another school within one year after the closure of their original school. False certification The Department proposes to streamline the rules for when a college falsely certifies a borrower’s eligibility for student loans when, in fact, the student was ineligible. These proposed rules would provide these borrowers with an easier path to a discharge. These improvements include expanding allowable documentation and clarifying the applicable dates for a discharge. The Department also proposes to allow for group false certification claims, so that similarly affected borrowers don’t need to individually apply for relief when sufficient evidence exists. An Equitable Agenda for an Education Beyond High School The proposed regulations released today are the latest action in the Department’s ongoing agenda to support a stronger, more equitable student aid system. The Department launched negotiations on affordability and student loan issues with a series of public hearings in June 2021. The negotiating committee, which was formed to develop proposed language, reached consensus on three of the issues being announced today: interest capitalization, total and permanent disability discharges, and false certification discharges. The negotiating committee also reached agreement on regulations governing a statutory change to make incarcerated individuals eligible to receive Pell Grants. Those regulations and the income-driven repayment changes negotiated by the committee will be released in a separate notice this summer. After negotiating on key issues to ensure a strong student loan safety net, the Department also formed a committee and negotiated critical issues related to ensuring accountability for colleges and programs that receive federal aid. Proposed regulations for two of those issues, the 90/10 rule and rules governing changes in ownership for colleges, will be released along with the rules surrounding Pell Grants for incarcerated individuals and income-driven repayment. The remainder of those issues, including the Department’s landmark gainful employment regulations that would require career training programs to meet minimum standards for their outcomes to retain eligibility for federal aid, will be released in early 2023. The proposed regulations released today are part of the Administration’s ongoing efforts to address challenges in the student loan system with long-term improvements. The Biden-Harris Administration has already approved nearly $26 billion in targeted student loan relief for more than 1.3 million borrowers through executive action. This includes: Approximately $8 billion through borrower defense; Nearly $9 billion to borrowers who are totally and permanently disabled; More than $8 billion to public servants through the PSLF program; and Over $1 billion in closed school discharges. The Department also recently announced steps to remedy long-standing problems in the income-driven repayment plans that will help tens of thousands of borrowers receive forgiveness through that program and through PSLF.

These actions will help meet President Biden’s call for more schools to invest in strategies to accelerate academic recovery using American Rescue Plan (ARP) funds and to galvanize more Americans to serve their communities by becoming tutors and mentors to help address the impact of missed instruction on our nation’s students. ""Now — more than ever — students need to feel supported, seen, heard, and understood by adults in their schools and communities,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""Today’s announcements and the launch of the National Partnership for Student Success will mean more students have a trusted adult in their corner, and more adults are prepared to address students’ academic, emotional, social, and mental health needs. Together, we can help all children make up for unfinished learning, recover from the pandemic, and prepare for future success – both inside and outside the classroom."" Today’s actions will build on the progress school communities made this year in helping students and families recover from the pandemic. To meet the President’s call to action, the Department is: Launching the National Partnership for Student Success and recruiting 250,000 new tutors and mentors. The U.S. Department of Education is joining forces with leading education, youth, and service organizations to launch the National Partnership for Student Success (NPSS), a new coalition that will support the expansion, launch and improvement of high-impact tutoring, mentoring and other programs to make up for lost instructional time, and support student mental health and overall wellbeing. The NPSS follows President Biden’s call for more tutors and mentors in the 2022 State of the Union Address to help students recover from the pandemic and thrive. The NPSS will bring together school districts, non-profit partners, and institutions of higher education to recruit, train, place, and support screened adults in critical high impact roles such as tutors, mentors, student success coaches, and more. Through the NPSS, individuals, schools and districts, community-based organizations, employers, and colleges and universities can sign up to support student recovery through volunteer opportunities, national service opportunities, mentoring programs, and work-study opportunities. The NPSS is run through collaboration between the U.S. Department of Education, AmeriCorps, and the Johns Hopkins Everyone Graduates Center. Expanding the Department’s Best Practices Clearinghouse to share best practices around academic and mental health recovery efforts. The Best Practices Clearinghouse will highlight and celebrate evidence-based and promising practices implemented by states, schools, and school districts using American Rescue Plan funds to support learning recovery, increased academic opportunities, and student mental health. The updated Best Practices Clearinghouse is the next phase of the Safer Schools and Campuses Best Practices Clearinghouse that the Department launched in Spring 2021, originally designed to share best practices around safely reopening schools, addressing inequities made worse by the pandemic, and providing summer learning and enrichment opportunities to help students get reconnected to their communities, peers, and educators. Empowering parents and school communities with knowledge about how their school is using and can use federal funds to provide the necessary academic and mental health supports. Last month, the Department launched the National Parents and Families Engagement Council to facilitate strong and effective relationships between schools and parents, families, and caregivers. Today, the Department put out a call to states and school communities to contribute to the revamped Best Practices Clearinghouse to ensure parents, educators, and families know how federal dollars are being spent. Additionally, to increase transparency and accountability, the Department updated an interactive map to make state and local plans for American Rescue Plan funds more accessible to families.

The new law also is part of a dangerous trend across the country, where we are seeing legislation targeting the LGBTQI+ community. I've spoken to parents and families in Florida numerous times, and they've consistently told me that this legislation doesn't represent them or what they want for their children, and that it put Florida students in danger of bullying and worse mental health outcomes. My commitment to students and families in Florida is the same as my commitment to all across this great country: The Biden-Harris administration will continue to fight for dignity, opportunity, and the protection of civil rights for every student and family.

Participants shared their personal experiences with the Secretary and with each other. Secretary Cardona listened and emphasized the importance of continuing to share these stories: “We need to hear your stories, your lived experiences. You’ve taken the challenges and you’ve turned them into helping others and I’m just so inspired by that. You’re making such a difference in the lives of the people you touch. Continue doing what you’re doing y les prometo que le vamos a echar ganas aquí también. We’re committed at the Department not only to listening, but to acting with what we’ve heard.” There are an estimated 200,000 DACA educators in our nation’s schools and classrooms who are a lifeline for our students. Since the implementation of the program, over 830,000 people have been able to live, study, and work without fear of deportation and continue to contribute billions in taxes each year. Alondra Garcia a bilingual educator in Milwaukee shared: “I’ve been educating my young students who are seven - eight years old about what undocumented and DACA means to ensure they’re aware about how undocumented people contribute to our communities. I think it’s so important to educate our communities and staff about what DACA is because so many people are not familiar with the program, given that it does not directly affect them.” Maria Almendra Rodriguez a school counselor and Professor at Mt. San Antonio College in Southern California said: “I’ve been able to use my own personal story and vulnerability to work with DACAmented students via one-on-one sessions to help them adapt their own narrative and confidence in sharing their unique personal experiences. Supporting students right from the beginning in developing, choosing and exploring careers is critical to their success.” Karen Reyes a special education teacher in Austin highlighted: “My experience as an undocumented educator has brought me a sense of understanding. My students might not know that they’re undocumented, but I work with a lot of parents, especially in special education. We are a team and they are a very important part of that team. And when they find out that I’m undocumented, that I’m on the same boat as them, it really does open the doors and really facilitates the relationships that are needed to ensure the success of their children.”"

OCR determined that the district violated Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and its implementing regulations by failing to respond promptly and effectively to repeated notice of ongoing sex-based harassment of a transgender student by another student, predicated on sex stereotyping. OCR found that the district failed to investigate known allegations that the other student had repeatedly harassed the student about her appearance, her voice, her body, her name, and her pronouns since the start of the 2017-2018 school year. The ongoing harassment the student experienced over the course of months left her feeling unsafe on campus. OCR also found that the district failed to respond promptly or effectively to notice in spring 2018 that this harassment was continuing, and that the district’s investigation of a 2018 incident involving alleged sex-based harassment of the student was neither adequate nor equitable. As a result of these failures, OCR determined that the district permitted the student to be subjected to a hostile environment based on sex that was sufficiently serious to deny or limit the student’s ability to participate in or benefit from the school’s program. The resolution agreement reached today commits the district to take the steps needed to ensure nondiscrimination on the basis of sex in all of its education programs and activities. ""Today’s resolution with the Tamalpais Union High School District addresses harassment visited on a transgender student based on unlawful sex stereotyping over the course of a school year,"" said Catherine E. Lhamon, Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights. ""This resolution will not only address discrimination against this one student but also ensure other students will not suffer the recurring harassment she experienced at school.""

23-Jun-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-releases-proposed-changes-title-ix-regulations-invites-public-comment,"The U.S. Department of Education Releases Proposed Changes to Title IX Regulations, Invites Public Comment","Today, in celebration of the 50th anniversary of Title IX – the landmark civil rights law that has opened doors for generations of women and girls – the U.S. Department of Education released for public comment proposed changes to the regulations that help elementary and secondary schools and colleges and universities implement this vital legislation. The proposed amendments will restore crucial protections for students who are victims of sexual harassment, assault, and sex-based discrimination – a critical safety net for survivors that was weakened under previous regulations. The proposed regulations will advance educational equity and opportunity for women and girls across the country to ensure that every student in America, from kindergarten through a doctorate degree, can achieve her dreams. ""Over the last 50 years, Title IX has paved the way for millions of girls and women to access equal opportunity in our nation's schools and has been instrumental in combating sexual assault and sexual violence in educational settings,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""As we celebrate the 50th Anniversary of this landmark law, our proposed changes will allow us to continue that progress and ensure all our nation's students – no matter where they live, who they are, or whom they love – can learn, grow, and thrive in school. We welcome public comment on these critical regulations so we can further the Biden-Harris Administration's mission of creating educational environments free from sex discrimination and sexual violence."" The proposed regulations will advance Title IX's goal of ensuring that no person experiences sex discrimination, sex-based harassment, or sexual violence in education. As the Supreme Court wrote in Bostock v. Clayton County , 140 S. Ct. 1731 (2020), it is ""impossible to discriminate against a person"" on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity without ""discriminating against that individual based on sex."" The regulations will require that all students receive appropriate supports in accessing all aspects of education. They will strengthen protections for LGBTQI+ students who face discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. And they will require that school procedures for complaints of sex discrimination, including sexual violence and other sex-based harassment, are fair to all involved. The proposed regulations also reaffirm the Department's core commitment to fundamental fairness for all parties, respect for freedom of speech and academic freedom, respect for complainants' autonomy, and clear legal obligations that enable robust enforcement of Title IX. The proposed regulations would: Clearly protect students and employees from all forms of sex discrimination. Provide full protection from sex-based harassment. Protect the right of parents and guardians to support their elementary and secondary school children. Require schools to take prompt and effective action to end any sex discrimination in their education programs or activities – and to prevent its recurrence and remedy its effects. Protect students and employees who are pregnant or have pregnancy-related conditions. Require schools to respond promptly to all complaints of sex discrimination with a fair and reliable process that includes trained, unbiased decisionmakers to evaluate the evidence. Require schools to provide supportive measures to students and employees affected by conduct that may constitute sex discrimination, including students who have brought complaints or been accused of sex-based harassment. Protect LGBTQI+ students from discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, and sex characteristics. Clarify and confirm protection from retaliation for students, employees, and others who exercise their Title IX rights. Improve the adaptability of the regulations' grievance procedure requirements so that all recipients can implement Title IX's promise of nondiscrimination fully and fairly in their educational environments. Ensure that schools share their nondiscrimination policies with all students, employees, and other participants in their education programs or activities. The Department will engage in a separate rulemaking to address Title IX's application to athletics. The Department's comprehensive review of its Title IX regulations began in March 2021, as directed by Executive Order 14021 – Guaranteeing an Educational Environment Free From Discrimination on the Basis of Sex, Including Sexual Orientation or Gender Identity. The Department has sought public input throughout that process. Over the last year, the Department has heard from a wide variety of stakeholders, including students, parents, and educators in elementary, secondary, and postsecondary schools, state government representatives, advocates, lawyers, researchers, and other stakeholders through the Title IX nationwide virtual public hearing in June 2021 convened by the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) and in numerous listening sessions and meetings. This input, together with careful review of federal case law and OCR's enforcement work under Title IX, highlighted the need to revise the current regulations to protect more fully against sex discrimination in all education programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance. ""The proposed regulations reflect the Department's commitment to give full effect to Title IX, ensuring that no person experiences sex discrimination in education, and that school procedures for addressing complaints of sex discrimination, including sexual violence and other forms of sex-based harassment, are clear, effective, and fair to all involved,"" said Catherine E. Lhamon, Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights. The Department's proposed Title IX regulations will be open for public comment for 60 days from the date of publication in the Federal Register. Additional information on the proposed rule, including a summary with background information and a fact sheet, is available here . The unofficial version of the proposed rule is available here ."

On June 23, 1972, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 was signed into law. Since then, the number of high school girls playing on their schools' athletic teams has increased from just 295,000 to more than 3.4 million in recent years. Today’s event was designed to inspire, educate, and empower athletes to advocate for the access and opportunities Title IX can and should provide. The event’s interactive stations featured soccer, running, basketball and STEM stations. The soccer station included Gaby Vincent, midfielder for the Washington Spirit, and the basketball drills were led by Howard University’s women’s and men’s basketball team. The STEM activities were led by TechBridge Girls and the Smithsonian Science Education Center. STEM activities included making sports drinks and learning how to bandage an injury. Throughout the field day, U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona, U.S. Deputy Secretary of Education Cindy Marten, and Assistant Secretary for the Office for Civil Rights Catherine Lhamon affirmed the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to advancing gender equity and equality by ensuring the Department takes all necessary actions protect the rights of all students. Secretary Cardona noted: “In no small part because of Title IX, our young women and girls can be anything you want to be. You can study anything you want to study. And you have the right to pursue your dreams. And that’s a good thing for young women and girls and young men and boys! The first 50 years of Title IX made our country more just and more equitable. Let’s work together to make sure the next 50 years are just as transformational!” After the opening remarks, an athlete panel was moderated by three-time Ice Hockey Olympic medalist Meghan Duggan and featured 29-time Paralympic swimming medalist Jessica Long and the most decorated Black athlete in Winter Olympics history Elana Meyers Taylor. Both athletes shared reflections about how Title IX helped pave the way for them to become celebrated Olympians. Vice President Kamala Harris joined the event by engaging with students while they participated in STEM activities and then she successfully made a basketball shot alongside young athletes. WSF President and three-time ice hockey medalist Meghan Duggan remarked: “Tomorrow marks the 50th anniversary of Title IX, a law that forever changed the face of sports, opening the doors for girls and women to have access and opportunity to play. Everyone here today is a benefactor of this law, including those of us on the stage. Fifty years ago, girls and women like us didn’t have the same opportunity to swim, play ice hockey, or bobsled. Title IX helped change that. We want to make sure Title IX stays strong! And we need the next generation – your generation – to help us do that.” “Because of Title IX, women are afforded equal access to areas that have traditionally been dominated by men, such as STEM and athletics. This has opened the door to innovations in these fields as well as women role models and mentors that young people can look up to as trailblazers and leaders of industry,” said Deputy Secretary Marten. “Without Title IX, there is a chance that many of the women in this room would not be standing here today, leading. For that reason, we must not take this for granted. Thanks to Title IX, it is your right to take up space, to be the best you can be, and to make a difference in your community and our nation.”"

This is a historic milestone in our nation’s recovery from the pandemic, and it will provide so many parents and families who have been waiting for this moment with more peace of mind about keeping their children safe and healthy. The Biden-Harris administration will take a whole-of-government approach to ensuring that every parent and caregiver who wants to secure a vaccine for their child is able to do so through pediatricians, primary care doctors, and other trusted healthcare providers, including community health centers and pharmacies. These vaccines are safe and will help save lives.”"

Since then, DACA has provided hundreds of thousands of people who grew up in the United States, living American lives and dreaming American dreams, with protection from deportation, access to work permits and education, and hope for a brighter future. Over the last ten years, Dreamers have thrived in our schools, contributed to our communities, and built successful careers in education, health care, the military and so much more. Yet congressional inaction has left a cloud of uncertainty and fear over Dreamers, their families, and thousands of undocumented youth throughout our nation. Today, I join President Biden in calling on Congress to take long overdue action, and pass bipartisan legislation that offers a path to citizenship for people who belong in this country, love this country, and call this country home.”"

OCR determined that the college violated both Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504) after investigating allegations that Salt Lake Community College encouraged a pregnant student to drop a course because she was pregnant, did not engage in an interactive process to provide her with academic adjustments or necessary services during her pregnancy, and did not excuse her pregnancy-related absences or allow her later to submit work following those absences. OCR found that the college violated Title IX and its implementing regulations by failing: (1) to respond promptly and equitably to the student’s complaint of pregnancy discrimination, (2) to engage in an interactive process with the student to determine the appropriate special services and/or academic adjustments to provide in light of her pregnancy, and (3) to excuse her absences related to pregnancy, provide her the opportunity to make up work missed due to these pregnancy-related absences, or provide her with alternatives to making up missed work at a later date. In addition, OCR found that the college violated Section 504 and its implementing regulations by failing to engage in an interactive process with the student and to consider whether her pregnancy caused a temporary disability requiring academic adjustments. “We look forward to working with Salt Lake Community College to promote a nondiscriminatory educational environment by ensuring pregnant students’ equal access to the college’s offerings,” said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon. “As we approach the 50th anniversary of Title IX next week, Salt Lake Community College’s commitments today take an important step to provide the equal access to education Congress has promised these 50 years. The resolution agreement will ensure the college’s compliance with Title IX, Section 504, and their implementing regulations as they apply to requests for academic adjustments based on pregnancy, pregnancy-related absences, and complaints of pregnancy discrimination. The college’s commitments in the voluntary resolution agreement include: Revising its non-discrimination notice and grievance procedures to comply with Title IX. Publishing information on its website for pregnant students about their Title IX rights and how to seek academic adjustments, special services, or excused absences. Training its Title IX coordinator, Disabilities Resource Center staff, and other school employees regarding Title IX ’s and Section 504’s protections for pregnant students and the academic adjustments and special services available to pregnant students. Completing and documenting its investigation of the student’s complaint of pregnancy discrimination. And, Taking other measures to remedy the discrimination against the student.

Families’ voices play a critical role in how the nation’s children are recovering from the pandemic. “Parents are a child’s first teachers, and there’s no one better equipped to work with schools and educators to identify what students need to recover,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “The National Parents and Families Engagement Council will serve as an important link between families and caregivers, education advocates and their school communities. The Council will help foster a collaborative environment where we can work together to serve the best interest of students and ensure they have the academic and mental health support they need to recover from the pandemic and thrive in the future.” The Council consists of parent, family, or caregiver representatives from national organizations that will work with the Department to identify constructive ways to help families engage at the local level. Organization representatives will reflect the diversity of the education system, including, but not limited to, families of students in public schools, charters, private schools, and homeschool. The Council will be a channel for parents and families to constructively participate in their children’s education by helping them understand the rights they have, create a feedback loop with schools to shape how American Rescue Plan (ARP) funds are deployed to meet students’ needs, and identify summer learning and enrichment opportunities for children in their communities. “Parents provide critical perspective, and they should always have a seat at the table whenever decisions are made that impact their children. And this is more important than ever in the effort to help students recover from the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Anna King, president of National Parent Teacher Association (PTA). “National PTA applauds the Department of Education for launching the National Parents and Families Engagement Council and providing a channel for parents’ voices to be heard and considered. This is essential to help make sure the needs of students are met coming out of the pandemic and ensure every child has everything they need to make their potential a reality.” “NAFSCE congratulates the Department of Education for establishing a National Parents and Families Engagement Council,” said Vito Borrello, executive director of the National Association for Family, School, and Community Engagement (NAFSCE). “This Council provides the opportunity to bring diverse parent voices together to inform the Department’s policies and programs, while also serving as a dissemination vehicle for engaging families across the country in equitable education policy.” At launch, Council members include: The Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates (COPAA) Fathers Incorporated Generations United Girls Inc. League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) Mocha Moms National Association for Family, School, and Community Engagement (NAFSCE) National Action Network National Military Family Association (NMFA) National Parent Teacher Association (PTA) National Parents Union (NPU) The National Center for Parent Leadership, Advocacy, and Community Empowerment (PLACE) United Parent Leaders Action Network (UPLAN) UnidosUS In the coming weeks, the Council will meet to discuss how their children are recovering; the different ways schools are providing academic, mental health and social and emotional support; and how they can best constructively engage with schools. In the coming months, the Department and the Council will hold local listening sessions with parents, families, principals, educators, and school community members to better understand the needs of students as they start the 2022-23 school year."
13-Jun-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-delivers-15-million-emergency-funds-support-uvalde-schools,U.S. Department of Education Delivers $1.5 Million in Emergency Funds to Support Uvalde Schools,"Today, the U.S. Department of Education furthered the Biden-Harris Administration’s whole-of-government response to the tragic mass shooting at Robb Elementary School by disbursing a $1.5 million School Emergency Response to Violence (Project SERV) grant to the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District (UCISD). The proactive release of grant funds reflects the extraordinary and immediate needs facing UCISD and follows Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona’s visit to the district on May 31 and June 1, 2022. Project SERV funds are authorized under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and may be used for activities that help restore a sense of safety and security for the district’s students, teachers, staff, and families, and that address specific needs of those individuals directly affected by the shooting. Such activities include mental health services for staff and students, and overtime pay for teachers, counselors, and security staff, and may take place over the summer in the form of additional summer programming. Secretary Cardona initiated the emergency funding through a letter to the district superintendent that outlines key assurances around the federal funding. In the days following the tragedy, Secretary Cardona and other Department staff communicated with UCISD leadership and their Texas Education Agency colleagues and pledged to support recovery efforts in the district and community with a range of technical assistance, including direct access to Department personnel and partners who have helped other communities respond to and recover from acts of school violence. “No community should have to experience a tragedy like this alone. While in Texas, I saw the Uvalde community come together in deep and meaningful ways to support one another and all the families who lost loved ones; and it is our turn to support them,” said Secretary Cardona. “In the hours and days since that tragic day, we have committed to providing the Uvalde community with every available resource they may require from the Department. Today’s release of these emergency funds is an initial step that will be followed by technical assistance and on-the-ground supports in the months and years to come.” The Department’s communication with UCISD acknowledges that the community’s needs and challenges in restoring the learning environment may change over time. Secretary Cardona committed that members of his team will provide direct support to the district in adjusting its Project SERV agreement to reflect these evolving needs. While funds may be used for a 12-month period, the Department stands ready to provide additional, longer-term assistance as requested. The Department’s Readiness and Emergency Management for Schools Center builds the preparedness capacity (including prevention, protection, mitigation, response, and recovery efforts) of schools, school districts, colleges, and their community partners at the local, state, and federal levels; and serve as the primary source of information for schools, school districts, and colleges for emergencies. The National Center on Safe and Supportive Learning Environments offers information and technical assistance focused on improving school climate and conditions for learning. For more information about the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitments to the Uvalde community, see the letter on the disbursed funds and Secretary Cardona’s statement immediately following the tragic events."

Currently enrolled at 56 of our nations HBCU's, the scholars were selected from a competitive pool of over 350 students. Applications also required the signature of their HBCU president or designated HBCU faculty, adding a level of prestige to this application process. ""The HBCU Scholars announced today have dedicated themselves to their learning and exemplify the talent that our nation's Historically Black Colleges and Universities have nurtured for generations,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""The Biden-Harris administration is committed to supporting these leaders and I cannot wait to learn from them while they serve as ambassadors for the White House Initiative and their institutions."" Over the course of an academic school year, HBCU Scholars will serve as ambassadors of the White House Initiative on HBCUs. They will be offered training and cross-university networking opportunities. Scholars will also have an opportunity to work on issues specifically related to the HBCU community and participate in national and regional events with professionals from a wide range of disciplines. “As an HBCU graduate I’m honored to announce our HBCU Scholars, our future leaders of tomorrow. At HBCU’s we are a family, we build each other up and we’re taught that we can do and be anything,"" said Dietra Trent, Executive Director of the White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence and Economic Opportunity through HBCU's. “I look forward to supporting the growth of our HBCU family through the Scholar Recognition Program.” A key feature of the HBCU Scholar Program is a partnership with NASA to foster innovation and opportunity for the cohorts. This partnership with NASA makes the Minority University Research and Education Project (MUREP) Innovation Tech Transfer Idea Competition (MITTIC), “Mini MITTIC” part of the HBCU Scholar Program. Through the Mini MITTIC program students will partner in developing ideas to commercialize technology derived from NASA intellectual property. Scholars will have the opportunity to present their IP ideas during the National HBCU Week Conference in September. “The goal with Mini MITTIC is to provide the HBCU Scholars with an authentic experience while ensuring they leave with the foundational tools to utilize NASA intellectual property to create their own business concept and participate in the full MITTIC competition,” said Misti Moore, NASA’s Johnson Space Center MUREP Lead & MITTIC Activity Manager. HBCU Scholars will also be invited to the 2022 HBCU Week National Annual Conference, on September 20-23 in Washington, D.C. During the conference, they will participate in sessions designed to engage a spirit of entrepreneurship, innovation, and personal and professional development. Most importantly, scholars will have opportunities to engage with one another and showcase their individual and collective talent. “As an HBCU Scholar I was able to connect with leaders and meet professionals from various sectors including government, the NFL and entertainment industry,” said Paige Blake, 2022 HBCU Scholar, Bowie State University. “The professional development skills I gained through the Scholar Program provided me with tools to navigate well beyond my academic career and I now proudly serve on the President’s Board of Advisors on HBCU's.” Program events are designed to enhance HBCU Scholars professional development and create post-graduation opportunities within non-profit, business, and federal agency partners to ensure that as a nation we remain globally competitive. More information about the 86 HBCU Scholars' activities will be provided in the coming months as they serve as ambassadors of the White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity through Historically Black Colleges and Universities. 2022 HBCU SCHOLAR COHORT ALABAMA Huntsville-Asia Jefferson attends Drake State Community and Technical College, Huntsville, AL Montgomery- Aylon Gipson attends Morehouse College, Atlanta, GA Montgomery- Da’Jon Stoudemire attends Stillman College, Tuscaloosa, AL Tuscaloosa- Chase Cameron attends Lane College, Jackson, TN ARKANSAS Conway- Marla McGhee attends North Carolina Central University, Durham, NC Little Rock- Jason Muka attends Philander Smith College, Little Rock, AR BAHAMAS Nassau- Jameliah Pinder attends Shaw University, Raleigh, NC CALIFORNIA Bellflower- Nahiem Banks attends Howard University, Washington, DC San Bernardino- Jordan Holt attends Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, AL DELAWARE Dover- Jessica Simmons attends Hampton University, Hampton, VA FLORIDA Miami- Myra Saunders attends Florida Memorial University, Miami, FL Orlando- Makira Burns attends Florida A&M University, Tallahassee, FL Pompano Beach- Ayana Emmanuel attends Alabama State University, Montgomery, AL Tallahassee- Khya Nelson attends Florida A&M University, Tallahassee, FL GEORGIA Athens- Malaya Moon attends Howard University, Washington, DC Atlanta- Nina Giddens attends Xavier University, New Orleans, LA Austell- Jennifer Vasquez attends Fort Valley State University, Fort Valley, GA Byron- Miykael Stith attends Fort Valley State University, Fort Valley, GA Glenwood- Andrea Holloway attends Alabama State University, Montgomery, AL Loganville- Pariyah E.

9-Jun-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/secretary-cardona-lays-out-vision-support-and-elevate-teaching-profession,Secretary Cardona Lays Out Vision to Support and Elevate the Teaching Profession,"Today, U.S Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona will lay out his vision for how the nation can support teachers across the country and elevate the teaching profession. During an address and fireside chat at the Bank Street College of New York, Secretary Cardona will discuss how the Department, states and districts, and higher education institutions can recruit, prepare, and retain great teachers and, in turn, improve our education system across the country. He also will highlight the work the Department has done to support teachers since the beginning of the Biden-Harris Administration and share his own experience and perspective as a former teacher, principal, and school administrator. In addition to Secretary Cardona’s visit, the Department is releasing a fact sheet on how American Rescue Plan (ARP) fund investments in our nation’s educators can be sustained for the long-term using other existing sources of federal funds. ""A great teacher in every classroom is one of the most important resources we can give our children to recover from this pandemic and thrive,"" said Secretary Cardona. ""Yet, even before the pandemic, many states and communities experienced shortages in qualified teachers, including in critical areas such as special education, bilingual education, career and technical education, and science, technology, engineering, and math education. The pandemic has only served to make these shortages worse—falling hardest on students in underserved communities. It’s not only our responsibility but our commitment at the Department of Education to encourage, invest in, and lift up teachers across America. The future of our country and our children’s futures depend on it."" Secretary Cardona’s vision will focus on three areas: Recruiting diverse, high-qualified teachers into the profession and investing in high-quality teacher pipeline programs Supporting educators’ professional development to ensure our nation’s students are receiving high-quality education to meet the demands of today’s economy Investing in strategies to retain high-quality educators and keep them in the profession long-term. The fact that in many states teachers do not earn a livable and competitive wage is a significant contributor to a weak pipeline and high attrition. In many states, teachers earn less than other professionals with similar qualifications. On average, teachers make about 20 percent less than other college-educated workers and make even less than that average in 25 states . In 38 states, the average teacher salary is so low that mid-career teachers who are the head of household for a family of four qualify for two or more government benefits based on income. President Biden and Secretary Cardona have called on states and districts to increase teacher salaries to help address teacher recruitment and retention. But in addition to increasing teacher salaries, our nation’s students are depending on federal, state, and local leaders to take bold actions to make sure they have access to diverse and talented educators who join, grow, and stay in the profession. Secretary Cardona laid out the following strategies that will continue to guide the Department of Education’s work to recruit, develop, and retain high-qualified teachers in the coming months and years: Investing in a strong and diverse teacher pipeline, including increasing access to affordable, comprehensive, evidence-based preparation programs, such as teacher residencies, Grow Your Own programs, including those that begin in high school, and apprenticeship programs Supporting teachers in earning initial or additional certification in high-demand areas such as special education and bilingual education or advanced certifications to better meet the needs of their students Helping teachers pay off their student loans, including through loan forgiveness and service scholarship programs Supporting teachers by providing them and students with the resources they need to succeed, including mentoring for early career teachers, high-quality curricular materials, and providing students with access to school counselors, social workers, nurses, mental health professionals, and other specialists Creating opportunities for teacher advancement and leadership, including participating in distributive leadership models, and serving as instructional coaches and mentors. To advance these efforts, the Department’s fiscal year 2023 budget request includes nearly $600 million in new funds—over funds included in the FY22 Omnibus—for a total of almost $3 billion—to recruit, support, and retain a talented, diverse workforce. These investments include $350 million to focus the Education Innovation and Research program on a new charge to improve teacher recruitment and retention; $132 million for Teacher Quality Partnerships to improve preparation for teachers (an additional $73 million); $20 million for the Hawkins Centers of Excellence to increase the number of diverse and talented teachers prepared at our Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Minority Serving Institutions, and Tribal Colleges and Universities (an additional $12 million); and $250 million for IDEA Part D to better prepare and support our special education teachers (an additional $155 million). Today’s announcement is part of an ongoing effort by the Department and the Biden-Harris Administration to invest in our nation’s teachers. Some of the Biden-Harris Administration’s first actions were to prioritize educators’ access to vaccinations and deliver unprecedented resources to our nation’s schools through the American Rescue Plan to help accelerate the reopening of schools for in-person learning and to support students’ academic recovery and mental health. As part of that effort, the Department has released guidance and fact sheets, hosted webinars for states and school districts, and partnered with the Departments of Treasury and Labor to encourage states and districts to use American Rescue Plan funds to support educator recruitment, retention, and well-being as part of a number of priorities ARP funds should be directed towards. Secretary Cardona also is calling on states, districts, and institutions of higher education to join in the effort of recruiting, investing in, and retaining diverse and talented educators by supporting the five strategies laid out above and in the fact sheet .

1-Jun-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/education-department-approves-58-billion-group-discharge-cancel-all-remaining-loans-560000-borrowers-who-attended-corinthian-colleges,"Education Department Approves $5.8 Billion Group Discharge to Cancel all Remaining Loans for 560,000 Borrowers who Attended Corinthian","Today, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) announced it will discharge all remaining federal student loans borrowed to attend any campus owned or operated by Corinthian Colleges Inc. (Corinthian) from its founding in 1995 through its closure in April 2015. This will result in 560,000 borrowers receiving $5.8 billion in full loan discharges. This includes borrowers who have not yet applied for a borrower defense discharge, who will have their Corinthian loans discharged without any additional action on their part. The action is the largest single loan discharge the Department has made in history. Providing this targeted relief is part of the Biden-Harris Administration's continued commitment to helping borrowers who are struggling the most by ensuring discharge programs provide borrowers the complete relief to which they are entitled. Today's action brings the total loan relief the Biden-Harris Administration has approved for borrowers to $25 billion since January 2021. The announcement today builds upon conclusions first reached by the Department of Education in 2015 that Corinthian engaged in widespread and pervasive misrepresentations related to a borrower's employment prospects, including guarantees they would find a job. Corinthian also made pervasive misstatements to prospective students about the ability to transfer credits and falsified their public job placement rates. Founded in 1995, Corinthian acquired several troubled private for-profit colleges across the country. At its peak in 2010, it enrolled more than 110,000 students at 105 campuses. Then-California Attorney General Kamala Harris' investigation into Corinthian played a key role in developing findings against the for-profit college chain and the Department's overall work to discharge the loans of borrowers who were harmed by its wrongdoing, a process that has helped cancel the loans of around 100,000 borrowers to date. ""As of today, every student deceived, defrauded, and driven into debt by Corinthian Colleges can rest assured that the Biden-Harris administration has their back and will discharge their federal student loans,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""For far too long, Corinthian engaged in the wholesale financial exploitation of students, misleading them into taking on more and more debt to pay for promises they would never keep. While our actions today will relieve Corinthian Colleges' victims of their burdens, the Department of Education is actively ramping up oversight to better protect today's students from tactics and make sure that for-profit institutions – and the corporations that own them – never again get away with such abuse."" Vice President Kamala Harris's History on Holding Corinthian Colleges Accountable In 2013, Vice President Kamala Harris sued Corinthian when she was attorney general of California, alleging that the company intentionally misrepresented to its students about job placement rates and was engaging in deceptive and false advertising and recruitment. Then Attorney General Harris' investigation and lawsuit triggered several other inquiries by the Department and other federal and state regulators as well as actions by the Department that ultimately resulted in Corinthian selling most of its campuses in 2014 and closing the remaining ones in 2015. In 2015, the Department and then-Attorney General Harris released comprehensive findings showing that Corinthian misrepresented job placement rates in programs across the country. Those were the basis of the first borrower defense approvals against Corinthian. It also led the Department to find that the company misrepresented to borrowers who attended its Everest, Heald College, or WyoTech campuses about their ability to find a job using their Corinthian degree. The Department also later found that Corinthian misrepresented students' ability to transfer credits over the same period at all Everest campuses, except the few that had regional accreditation, the WyoTech campus in Laramie, Wyoming, and for borrowers who enrolled in certain programs at Heald campuses in California. In 2016, then-Attorney General Harris and the state of California obtained a more than $1 billion judgment against Corinthian, in which the judge found that the company misrepresented job placement rates, its program offerings, whether students could transfer credits, among many other false or misleading actions. The Department will soon begin notifying students who attended Corinthian of this decision, with the actual discharges following in the months after. Borrowers will not have to take any actions to receive their discharges. The Department would like to thank the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, as well as the Offices of the Attorney General in California, Illinois, Massachusetts, Wisconsin, and 15 others who shared information that informed the Department's findings. The Department also acknowledges the extensive work done by many former Corinthian students to raise attention to the problems at the institution and the need for a process to grant relief for those harmed. Finally, the Department would also like to thank the Federal Student Aid Borrower Defense Group and the Administrative Actions and Appeals Service Group in the Department's Federal Student Aid office and the Department's Office of the General Counsel, for their work on the Corinthian findings. Continued Commitment to Targeted Relief Today's action is part of the Department's broader goals to ensure better implementation of the student loan programs to get students and borrowers the benefits to which they are entitled, including loan discharges. These goals also include enacting lasting policies to make loans more affordable and prevent a future debt crisis by holding colleges accountable for leaving students with mountains of debt and without good jobs. Including this group discharge, the Department has now approved $25 billion in loan forgiveness for 1.3 million borrowers. This includes: $7.9 billion for 690,000 borrowers whose institutions took advantage of them through discharges related to borrower defense and school closures. $7.3 billion for more than 127,000 borrowers through Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF). More than $8.5 billion in total and permanent disability discharges for more than 400,000 borrowers. The Department also recently announced fixes to long-standing problems in income-driven repayment that will help thousands of borrowers receive forgiveness through that program as well as 40,000 borrowers who receive PSLF. The Department is also working on new regulations that will permanently improve a variety of the existing student loan relief programs, significantly reduce monthly payments, and provide greater protections for students and taxpayers against unaffordable debts."

The report summarizes the latest data on education and includes changes in enrollment from fall of 2019 through fall of 2020, the first year of schooling during the COVID-19 pandemic. “ When I took office, only 46 percent of schools were open for in-person learning. Now, more than 99 percent of schools and colleges are open, and our institutions are beginning to heal. We know COVID-19 disrupted our schools and colleges , and this report serves as an important reminder of the work left to be done on the road to recovery. The Department’s urgency has shifted from getting institutions open to , now, keeping them open; providing the necessary academic, financial and mental health supports for students and families; and strengthening our K-12 and post-secondary education systems. Together— with educators, parents, and staff — we can help schools and colleges recover and thrive. “ Considering last week’s tragedy in Uvalde, Texas, this data also shines a light on a dark truth — the growing prevalence of gun violence in our schools. As I recently said to members of Congress, I am ashamed that we as a country are becoming desensitized to these horrific tragedies. As parents, leaders, and educators, protecting our children is more important than anything else. The time for thoughts and prayers alone is over. We need legislative action. We can do better, and we must do better.”"

As a parent, I am filled with grief for the families and students; concern that as our schools move past pandemic closures, the fear of shootings has become all too real once again; and anger at the lack of will by many to pass legislation that can protect our children. I pray our nation has not grown numb to the horrors that unfolded today at Robb Elementary School, when the lives of 18 precious children and a devoted educator were cut short.

""I spent the formative part of my career in a Connecticut elementary school. I will never forget the ripple effect of fear and heartbreak that spread among students and teachers in the aftermath of the horrific Sandy Hook shooting.

The district committed to take steps necessary to ensure that students with disabilities receive the free appropriate public education (FAPE) to which they are entitled without unnecessary restraint or seclusion or missed instruction. OCR’s investigation identified concerns that students who were repeatedly subjected to restraint or seclusion lost educational time and services, and that the district did not re-evaluate students who were repeatedly restrained or secluded to determine whether they should receive additional supports or compensatory services. The district’s agreement to change its practices with respect to the use of restraint or seclusion, and its commitment to examine and remedy prior instances where restraint and seclusion of its students may have denied them a FAPE, reflect the district’s willingness to address the civil rights of its students. “I thank Horry County Schools for its commitment to revise its practices and procedures regarding the use of restraint and seclusion to ensure that students with disabilities receive the education to which they are entitled,” said Catherine E. Lhamon, assistant secretary for civil rights. The district’s commitments to resolve the investigation include: Revising its procedures and guidance documents on the use of restraint or seclusion. Clarifying the roles and responsibilities of those involved in monitoring and oversight of the district’s use of restraint or seclusion. Modifying its recordkeeping system. Creating a plan to accurately report data to the Civil Rights Data Collection . Training staff on the district’s procedures and new recordkeeping system. Reviewing files of currently enrolled students who were restrained or secluded since the start of the 2017-2018 school year to determine, in part, whether any student requires compensatory education for educational services missed due to incidents of restraint or seclusion.

The summit will spotlight the essential partnership between schools and families to ensure effective implementation of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. The Department is also releasing new resources for schools, colleges, and communities to promote mental health and the social and emotional well-being of children and students. “Today’s summit is a testament to the strength and resilience of the disability community, a community that we know has faced unique challenges in the face of the pandemic,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “The Department stands ready to help educators, school and program staff, and families thoughtfully design learning experiences—and to ensure students with disabilities continue to have equal access to in-person instruction. May is also Mental Health Awareness Month, and today’s summit demonstrates the ongoing commitment of the Biden-Harris administration to protecting our students’ social-emotional well-being.” The Department's efforts today build on President Biden's Unity Agenda goal of transforming how Americans understand, access, and treat mental health. FAQs on the Disability-Related Rights of Student Veterans with Disabilities The Department’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR), in coordination with the Military Affairs Team , is issuing a new resource to address questions that student veterans with disabilities may have about their civil rights as college students. The FAQ highlights that the legal standards used to determine disability status under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, a federal civil rights law that protects students with disabilities from discrimination, are not the same as the standards used by the military and the U.S Department of Veteran Affairs. The FAQ also describes when veterans with disabilities are entitled to academic accommodations and how they may request them. Resources on Website Accessibility A new series of “how-to” videos on website accessibility covers topics including how people with disabilities use technology, applicable federal laws, and how to identify and remediate technological barriers that can interfere with the ability of parents and students with disabilities to participate in modern American education. OCR’s National Digital Accessibility Team has resolved over 1,000 digital accessibility cases since its formation just under three years ago, making educational institutions’ online programs, services, and activities more accessible to people with disabilities. The 20-part video series draws from that experience and was released in partnership with the ADA National Network. Digital Accessibility Compliance Reviews OCR will soon launch 100 new compliance reviews examining digital accessibility in elementary and secondary schools and districts, postsecondary institutions, state departments of education, libraries, and vocational rehabilitation services. Reviews will cover online learning, public-facing websites, and parent-resource and communications platforms to ensure compliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act. The American Rescue Plan included $3 billion to help states support infants, toddlers, children, and youth with disabilities. Another $40 billion was provided to colleges through Higher Education Emergency Relief Funds to provide emergency aid to students and meet urgent public health needs related to the pandemic, including providing evidence-based mental health supports. “The last few years have been especially tough on students—and students with disabilities, in particular, who’ve faced huge barriers and had their lives turned upside down,” said U.S. Sen. Patty Murray. “We owe it to every single student with a disability and every single student struggling with mental health challenges to get them the support they need in order to thrive inside and out of the classroom. That’s why I worked so hard to pass the American Rescue Plan and get students and schools the resources they need to get back in the classroom safely and get their learning back on track, and I’m glad Secretary Cardona is so focused on eliminating barriers for students with disabilities—and making sure all students can get the quality education they deserve.” Today’s sessions will include: Opening remarks from U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona.

The guidance will help colleges support students as they navigate mental health challenges exacerbated by the pandemic. It also includes specific examples of how colleges can use Higher Education Emergency Relief Funds (HEERF) to invest in evidence-based mental health supports for students and connect the campus community to providers and care. The guidance highlights leading colleges already using HEERF funds for these efforts. The Department's efforts build on President Biden's Unity Agenda goal of transforming how Americans understand, access, and treat mental health and is being released during Mental Health Awareness Month. ""If there is one thing I've heard while speaking with college students throughout the nation, it's been the need for greater mental health supports on campus,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""We must make sure our colleges and universities have the tools and resources to help students, faculty, and staff heal from the grief, trauma, and anxiety they endured amid the pandemic. Today's guidance will equip higher education leaders with promising strategies for how they can use American Rescue Plan dollars to connect students to the services they need and to better support mental health and wellness throughout their campus communities."" Later today, Secretary Cardona will highlight the guidance and discuss how federal funds, including support from the American Rescue Plan, can play a critical role in addressing mental health during a virtual roundtable with students at the University of California, Riverside. The university used federal pandemic relief funds to provide immediate crisis support and teletherapy to students and expanded wellness resources for staff. College students, faculty, and staff have been particularly impacted as losses from COVID-19 and disruptions in the learning environment have led to increased anxiety and depression. According to a Fall 2021 survey of college presidents conducted by the American Council on Education, nearly 75 percent rated student mental health as a pressing issue. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicates that 63 percent of 18-24-year-olds have reported anxiety or depression due to the COVID-19 pandemic, while 25 percent have had suicidal thoughts. The American Rescue Plan provided nearly $40 billion for colleges and universities through HEERF, in addition to $36 billion provided under previous relief packages. This funding has helped colleges – particularly community colleges and institutions enrolling students from underserved groups – meet urgent public health needs related to the pandemic. Examples of how colleges can use HEERF to offer mental health supports include: Strengthening mental health resources : Telehealth: Lac Courte Oreilles Ojibwe College in Wisconsin – a tribal college – partners with a mental health platform to allow all students and faculty on-demand, 24/7 access to counselors. In-person professionals: Sinclair Community College in Ohio hired a social worker to provide case management to students. Connecting students to care : Gatekeeper training/suicide prevention training: Davidson-Davie Community College in North Carolina provided gatekeeper trainings and materials to over 30 faculty and staff. Call/Text hotline: State University of New York at Albany runs a student peer phone hotline to allow students to call with mental health concerns or to talk. Creating long-lasting support : Suicide Prevention Coordinating Committee: North Carolina Central University – a historically black university – created a suicide prevention coordinating committee to develop on-campus resources and a suicide response plan. Today's guidance provides examples of how institutions can continue offering mental health supports to students, faculty, and staff through existing HEERF funds. Initial investments in high-impact mental health projects can be made now, with ongoing support of successful programs from philanthropic efforts, local partnerships, or other funding sources. The Biden-Harris Administration remains committed to ensuring recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Today's announcement reflects the Administration's pledge to provide resources and support to institutions and their communities. Last October, the Department also released Supporting Child and Student Social, Emotional, Behavioral and Mental Health , a resource for schools, colleges and communities to promote mental health and the social and emotional well-being of children and students. Additionally, in January the Department announced $198 million in American Rescue Plan funds to support students' basic needs and provided guidance on how colleges could use federal funds to bolster mental health counseling programs. A copy of today's published mental health guidance can be found here . For more information on HEERF under the American Rescue Plan, please visit https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ope/arp.html .

11-May-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/education-department-announces-161-students-be-honored-2022-us-presidential-scholars,Education Department Announces 161 Students to be Honored as 2022 U.S. Presidential Scholars,"U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona today announced the 58 th class of U.S. Presidential Scholars, recognizing 161 high school seniors for their accomplishments in academics, the arts, and career and technical education fields. ""Our 2022 Presidential Scholars represent the best of America, and remind us that when empowered by education, there are no limits to what our young people can achieve,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""Today, I join President Biden to celebrate a class of scholars whose pursuit of knowledge, generosity of spirit, and exceptional talents bring our nation tremendous pride. Throughout one of the most trying periods in our nation's history and amid our recovery from the pandemic, our students have once again demonstrated their strength and that they have so much to contribute to our country. Thanks to them, I know America's future is bright."" The White House Commission on Presidential Scholars selects scholars annually based on their academic success, artistic and technical excellence, essays, school evaluations and transcripts, as well as a demonstrated commitment to community service and leadership. Of the 3.7 million students expected to graduate from high school this year, more than 5,000 candidates qualified for the 2022 awards determined by outstanding performance on the College Board SAT or ACT exams or through nominations made by chief state school officers, other partner recognition organizations and YoungArts , the National Foundation for the Advancement of Artists. As directed by Presidential Executive Order, the 2022 U.S. Presidential Scholars are comprised of one young man and one young woman from each state, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, and U.S. families living abroad, as well as 15 chosen at-large, 20 scholars in the arts and 20 scholars in career and technical education. Created in 1964, the U.S. Presidential Scholars Program has honored over 7,900 of the nation's top-performing students. The program was expanded in 1979 to recognize students who demonstrate exceptional talent in the visual, literary and performing arts. In 2015, the program was again extended to recognize students who demonstrate ability and accomplishment in career and technical education fields. The Presidential Scholars Class of 2022 will be recognized for their outstanding achievement this summer with an online recognition program.

6-May-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-announces-intent-strengthen-and-protect-rights-students-disabilities-amending-regulations-implementing-section-504,U.S. Department of Education Announces Intent to Strengthen and Protect Rights for Students with Disabilities by Amending Regulations Implementing Section 504,"Forty-five years after publication of the regulations implementing Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the landmark disability civil rights law, the U.S. Department of Education announced plans to gather public input on possible amendments to those regulations in order to strengthen and protect the rights of students with disabilities. Section 504 prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in public and private programs and activities that receive federal financial assistance, including schools and postsecondary institutions. The Department's Office for Civil Rights will solicit public comments to help decide how best to improve current regulations to assist America's students with disabilities. May is Mental Health Awareness Month and, as part of the President's Unity Agenda, President Biden announced a strategy to address our nation's mental health crisis. The work that OCR will do this month to listen to and solicit public input regarding improvements to the Department's disability rights regulations will include input from those people with disabilities who also have mental health needs and their advocates. ""While the world has undergone enormous changes since 1977, the Department's Section 504 regulations have remained, with few exceptions, unaltered,"" said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon. ""As we observe the 45th anniversary of these important regulations this month, it is time to start the process of updating them. Just as in 1977, the voices of people with disabilities must be heard and incorporated as we engage in that work."" In April 1977, hundreds of people with disabilities and their supporters held protests at several of the regional offices of the Department of Education's predecessor agency demanding that the agency approve the long-delayed non-discrimination regulations implementing Section 504 to protect the civil rights of people with disabilities. The protest in the Department's San Francisco office lasted nearly a month, until the Secretary signed the regulations without change on April 28, 1977. They were formally published on May 9, 1977. The Department's Section 504 regulations were the first issued by the federal government that addressed the treatment of people with disabilities through a civil rights framework, rather than through solely a medical or vocational framework. In the years that followed, these regulations served as a model for the regulations of other federal agencies and were the foundation for many of the provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. For more than four decades, OCR has worked to eliminate disability discrimination in schools—including public pre-K through high schools, as well as postsecondary schools—by investigating complaints alleging violations of the regulations, conducting proactive investigations, issuing policy guidance, and providing technical assistance. On April 28, the Department announced a resolution agreement with the second-largest school district in the country, Los Angeles Unified School District, requiring it to take steps necessary to ensure that students with disabilities receive educational services, including compensatory services, during and resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of the development of the proposed amendments to the Section 504 regulations, the Department is soliciting public input. Interested parties may go to www2.ed.gov/policy/rights/reg/ocr/ to submit comments. The Department will also hold listening sessions in the coming months. Any comments received may be made available to the public, so commenters should avoid including any personal information that they want to keep confidential. In addition, the Department intends to rely on prior feedback received in response to an earlier Request for Information regarding the nondiscriminatory administration of school discipline, and other information, to decide what changes would be most appropriate to include in a notice of proposed rulemaking. The Department and OCR are committed to fulfilling Congress' promises in Section 504 and to advancing progress in partnership with people with disabilities and the full educational community."
28-Apr-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/office-civil-rights-reaches-resolution-agreement-nations-second-largest-school-district-los-angeles-unified-meet-needs-students-disabilities-during-covid-19-pandemic,"Office for Civil Rights Reaches Resolution Agreement with Nation’s Second Largest School District, Los Angeles Unified, to Meet Needs of Students with Disabilities during COVID-19 Pandemic","The U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) today resolved an investigation of the Los Angeles Unified School District in California with an agreement requiring it to take steps necessary to ensure that students with disabilities receive educational services, including compensatory services, during and resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. OCR investigated the district’s provision during the pandemic of the free appropriate public education (FAPE) to which federal civil rights law entitles students with disabilities. OCR’s investigation found that the district failed to provide services identified in students’ Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) and Section 504 plans during remote learning. For example, OCR found that during remote learning, the district: Limited the services provided to students with disabilities based on considerations other than the students’ individual educational needs. Failed to accurately or sufficiently track services provided to students with disabilities. Directed district service providers to include attempts to communicate with students and parents—including emails and phone calls—as the provision of services, documenting such on students’ service records. Informed staff that the district was not responsible for providing compensatory education to students with disabilities who did not receive FAPE during the COVID-19 school closure period because the district was not at fault for the closure. And, Failed to develop and implement a plan adequate to remedy the instances in which students with disabilities were not provided a FAPE during remote learning. The district agreed to resolve these violations by creating and implementing a comprehensive plan to address the compensatory education needs of students with disabilities due to the COVID-19 pandemic. “Today’s resolution will ensure that the more than 66,000 Los Angeles Unified students with disabilities will receive the equal access to education to which federal civil rights law entitles them, including compensatory education for any services the district did not provide during the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon. “I am deeply grateful for the district’s commitment now to meet the needs of its students with disabilities.” Through implementation of the resolution agreement the district will: Develop and implement a plan to appropriately assess and provide compensatory education to students with disabilities who did not receive a FAPE during the COVID-19 pandemic. Designate a plan administrator to implement the plan for assessment of compensatory education. Convene IEP and Section 504 teams to determine whether students were not provided the regular or special education and related aids and services designed to meet their individual needs during remote learning and determine compensatory education. Track and report to OCR the implementation of the plan for compensatory education. And, Conduct outreach to parents, guardians, students, and other stakeholders to publicize the plan for compensatory education and the role of the plan administrator The Department of Education made it a top priority since the beginning of the Biden Administration to reopen schools quickly and safely, and ensure all students, including students with disabilities, had equal access to high-quality education during the COVID pandemic. While the Department made clear that students learn best in-person and that states and districts should be using the $130 billion in American Rescue Plan Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) funds to bring students back to in-person learning, it also underscored the importance of supporting students with disabilities and other communities disproportionately impacted during the shift to remote learning. As part of these efforts, OCR earlier this year released a fact sheet on the obligation to provide compensatory services to remedy educational or other deficits that result from students with disabilities not receiving evaluations or services to which they were entitled during the COVID-19 pandemic. Likewise, the Department’s Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services released guidance that addresses the requirement to provide compensatory services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). In addition, the Department’s Office of Elementary and Secondary Education in December published a resource focused on allowable uses of funding under ESSER and GEER (the Governor’s Emergency Education Relief fund) to prevent, prepare for, and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. The FAQ specifically highlights: (1) providing educational and related services under Section 504, including, but not limited to, providing additional instruction and services to students with disabilities, often referred to as compensatory services, to make up for any skills that might have been lost if it is individually determined that the student was unable to receive a FAPE as a result of school closure or other COVID disruption; and (2) supporting students with disabilities under the IDEA, including by eliminating evaluation backlogs and providing support and direct services, such as technical assistance, personnel preparation, and professional development and training. Under the American Rescue Plan ESSER fund, LA Unified School District received over $2.5 billion in funds to support the safe and sustained reopening of schools and recovery efforts. The letter to Los Angeles Unified School District is available here , and the resolution agreement is available here ."
28-Apr-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/education-department-approves-238-million-group-discharge-28000-marinello-schools-beauty-borrowers-based-borrower-defense-findings,"Education Department Approves $238 Million Group Discharge for 28,000 Marinello Schools of Beauty Borrowers Based on Borrower Defense Findings","Today, the Department of Education announced it will deliver relief to tens of thousands of borrowers harmed by pervasive and widespread misconduct at Marinello Schools of Beauty. Borrowers who enrolled in the schools from 2009 through its closure in February 2016 will receive loan discharges based on borrower defense findings. These 28,000 borrowers will receive loan discharges totaling approximately $238 million. This group discharge will provide relief to borrowers who enrolled at Marinello during this period, including those who have not yet applied for a borrower defense discharge. While the Department continues its work to review borrower defense claims, it is also bringing on four key hires in the Federal Student Aid (FSA) Office of Enforcement with significant federal, congressional, and state oversight experience. “Marinello preyed on students who dreamed of careers in the beauty industry, misled them about the quality of their programs, and left them buried in unaffordable debt they could not repay,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “Today’s announcement will streamline access to debt relief for thousands of borrowers caught up in Marinello’s lies. At the Department of Education, we will continue to strengthen oversight and enforcement for colleges and career schools that engaged in misconduct and uphold the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to helping students who have been harmed.” This Marinello group discharge reflects the Department’s findings that the school engaged in pervasive and widespread misconduct that negatively affected all borrowers who enrolled at Marinello during the covered time period. These findings led the Department to approve individual borrower defense claims last summer. This group discharge will facilitate relief to additional borrowers harmed by Marinello’s actions, including many who have not yet applied for borrower defense. It is the first group discharge for defrauded borrowers to be approved since 2017, after the prior administration did not approve any group claims or new findings. Today’s actions bring the total amount of approved relief based on borrower defense findings during the Biden-Harris Administration to approximately $2.1 billion for 132,000 borrowers. To date, the Department had approved approximately 300 borrower defense claims at Marinello under findings reached last July that Marinello made widespread, substantial misrepresentations about the instruction that would be offered at its campuses across the country. The Department found that the schools failed to train students in key elements of a cosmetology program, such as how to cut hair. It also found that Marinello left students without instructors for weeks or months at a time as part of a pattern of failing to provide the education it promised. As a result, students would have found it extremely difficult to pass necessary state licensing tests and receive the promised return on their educational investment. Not only did Marinello fail to teach its students, class-action lawsuits filed in Nevada and California alleged that the school used salons as profit centers and exploited students as a source of unpaid labor. The Department has continued to analyze the evidence related to Marinello and concluded that the misconduct was so widespread across all the school’s campuses over a period of years that all borrowers who attended between 2009 and the schools’ closures in 2016 are entitled to full student loan. The Department’s Marinello findings stem primarily from the agency’s investigative work that began in 2015 and that resulted in the Department removing the school from the federal student aid programs. At all times relevant to the findings, Marinello was owned by B&H Education Inc. (B&H), which was a Delaware corporation. The leaders of B&H included Rashed Elyas as president, Mike Flecker as chief financial officer, and Nancy Alpough as financial aid administrator. Department records also identify the following individuals as board members at some point during the period of these borrower defense findings: Nagui Elyas, Erik Brooks, Bob Pan, Tomer Yosef-Or, Brent Stone, James Goodman, Daniel Neuwirth, Anna Keeling, James Rich, Frank Lincoln, and Gerald Taylor. The Department will soon begin notifying students who attended Marinello of their approvals for discharge, with discharges following in the months after. Borrowers will not have to take any additional actions to receive their discharges. New Hires in the Office of Enforcement Holding schools accountable is a priority for the Biden-Harris Administration, and FSA has made four key new hires to bolster its Enforcement Office’s leadership team. Dawn Bilodeau has joined FSA as the Enforcement Office’s senior advisor for policies and oversight after more than 20 years at the Department of Defense, which included roles as the senior advisor to the assistant secretary of defense for readiness and the director of Defense Voluntary Education Programs. Dawn twice received the Secretary of Defense Medal for Exceptional Civilian Service, and in 2020, she received the Council of College and Military Educators President’s Award. Christopher J. Madaio joins FSA as the Enforcement Office’s director of investigations. Christopher joins FSA from Veterans Education Success, where he served as the vice president for legal affairs. Prior to that, Christopher served for nearly six years as an assistant attorney general in the Consumer Protection Division of Maryland’s Office of the Attorney General, where he led multi-state investigations into large institutions of higher education and secured significant relief for students victimized by misconduct. Brad Middleton will join FSA as the Enforcement Office’s senior advisor for strategy. For the last 14 years, Brad has served on the staff of U.S. Sen. Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, including serving as his education policy director since 2013. During his time in the Senate, Brad has focused on institutional accountability and providing student loan debt relief for defrauded borrowers. Nina Schichor joins FSA as the Enforcement Office’s director of borrower defense following nearly five years at the National Labor Relations Board and seven years at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). Most recently, Nina served as senior litigation counsel in the CFPB’s Office of Enforcement, where she led teams to conduct investigations into student-related businesses and obtained substantial relief for students harmed by violations of federal consumer financial law. Continued commitment to targeted relief Including today’s actions, the Department has now approved more than $18.5 billion in loan discharges for more than 750,000 borrowers. This includes: $6.8 billion in for more than 113,000 borrowers through Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF). More than $8.5 billion in total and permanent disability discharges for more than 400,000 borrowers. Last week the Department also announced fixes to long-standing problems in income-driven repayment that will help thousands of borrowers receive forgiveness through that program as well as 40,000 borrowers receive PSLF. The Department is also working on new regulations that will improve a variety of the existing student loan relief programs and provide greater protections for students and taxpayers."

The announcements highlight how the American Rescue Plan has funded efforts to help students recover academically through summer learning and enrichment, and enhanced educational and mental health supports in districts across the country; how philanthropic partners are investing additional resources to help American Rescue Plan dollars stretch even further; and how the Department is leveraging over $160 million of its own grant funding to propel academic and mental health recovery for K-12 students across the country. The announcements will be made at the Department’s American Rescue Plan Summit, “From Recovery to Thriving,” broadcast on Department of Education channels at 5 p.m. ET, Wednesday, April 27, 2022, and held in partnership with the National Public Education Support Fund. “As we move beyond reopening, the Biden-Harris Administration and the Department of Education will remain laser-focused on helping students recover academically from the pandemic and access the academic, mental health, and other supports they need to thrive,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “We are already seeing the impact the American Rescue Plan is having on schools, students, families, and educators—from increased access to academic and mental health supports to expanded summer learning and enrichment programs funded by federal pandemic relief funds. With additional investments from the Department’s grant programs and the philanthropic community, we can scale our recovery efforts, make ARP dollars have an even greater impact, and ensure every student—no matter their background, family income, or zip code—has the academic and mental health supports they need to succeed. In states and districts across the country, American Rescue Plan funds are having a direct impact on student, family, and educators’ recovery.” ARP provided $130 billion in funding to states and districts across the country to help K-12 schools reopen during the pandemic and recover. The Department acted swiftly to release these funds to states and has called on states to act with the same urgency to ensure ARP dollars are reaching districts and classrooms to meet the immediate needs of students, families, educators, and communities. All states are now in compliance with the requirement to release the first two-thirds of funds to districts by the one-year deadline since ARP was passed. It is more important than ever that these funds are used to help students recover from the pandemic. ARP required that at least 5% of state funds and 20% of district funds be used to invest in evidence-based practices that address lost instructional time and at least 1% be used by states and districts to support afterschool programs, and at least 1% be used to support summer learning and enrichment programs. Consistent with President Biden’s Unity Agenda announced in his State of the Union address, the Department also has strongly encouraged schools and school districts to use ARP funds to support the health and well-being of students and educators by hiring more mental health professionals and school counselors, and has called on states, districts, and higher education institutions to use ARP funds to help address the educator labor shortage by investing ARP funds in educator pipeline programs. All three of these priorities will be discussed, and examples of districts using ARP funds for these efforts will be highlighted at the Department’s Summit on Wednesday evening. Today’s announcements leading into the ARP Recovery Summit include: 2022 Summer Learning and Enrichment Opportunities, and Technical Assistance Funded by the American Rescue Plan During the Summit, the Department will highlight commitments from national organizations, cities, community-based organizations, and school districts to expand summer learning and enrichment opportunities for summer 2022, funded by the American Rescue Plan. Commitments include: New grant funding to match district investments of ARP funds to support camp-school partnership programs . The American Camp Association (ACA) and the National Summer Learning Association (NSLA) are launching a new camp-school partnership program to create 10 new summer learning programs, in collaboration with 10 public school districts, for low-income students as they prepare for the next school year. The camps will receive $25,000 grants and ask schools to match the camp financial contribution using their ARP funds. ACA and NSLA will provide camps and school districts with coaching, training, planning, convening, and assessment support. New tools to help families identify summer learning and enrichment opportunities for their children. NSLA is launching an updated DiscoverSummer.org and a $3 million public service announcement (PSA) campaign to encourage families to identify summer learning and enrichment opportunities in their communities. The new and updated site will include over 30,000 summer learning and enrichment programs in a searchable database, many of which have been funded or expanded from American Rescue Plan funds. Technical assistance to help states, districts, and communities leverage ARP resources to support summer programming in 2022 and beyond. The National League of Cities is partnering with the Afterschool Alliance to produce an interactive map , highlighting how districts and municipalities are investing in afterschool and summer programming using various ARP funding streams, so communities can see which cities are making investments in summer programming using ARP funds as well as previous rounds of federal pandemic relief funds. The Afterschool Alliance also is providing strategic support to the 50 state afterschool networks and additional allies and partners. Through this support and with the unprecedented resources from ARP, these efforts allow for at least $2.75 billion in ARP funds directed to quality afterschool and summer learning programs run by local school districts and their CBO partners to help address the equity and opportunity gaps. Nationally, FutureEd at Georgetown University projects that school districts will spend $7.5 billion on summer learning and afterschool programs. Highlighting examples of multi-million dollar ARP investments to expanded summer learning and enrichment offerings in 2022. During and following the ARP Recovery Summit, the Department will highlight examples of cities and districts using ARP funds to expand summer learning offerings this year, including Baltimore, Maryland, allocating nearly $9 million in ARP funds for summer youth employment programs; Columbus, Ohio, allocating over $15 million for summer youth engagement and anti-violence efforts; Madison, Wisconsin, allocating over $1 million in ARP funds to expand their youth employment program; and Washington, DC, allocating $2 million in ARP funds to expand academic and recreational camps for DC youth. A broader list of summer programs fueled by ARP resources can be found on the Department’s website . In early 2021, the Department recognized that states, districts, and their community partners needed support as they waded through the vast amount of information available to support summer learning and enrichment. To address this need, the Department and the National Comprehensive Center hosted the Summer Learning and Enrichment Collaborative (SLEC), a series of virtual learning opportunities during the summer of 2021 for states, school districts, community partners, and other stakeholders to discuss and share promising practices for planning and implementing summer experiences for all students and student groups, especially those who have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. More than 20 national partners contributed their time and expertise to build out the programming and supports, and the SLEC engaged more than 1,300 individuals, including representation from 49 state education agencies, across eight virtual events. Today’s announcements build off that groundwork that the Summer Learning and Enrichment Collaborative laid over the past year. Nearly $60 Million in Philanthropic Efforts to Scale Impact of American Rescue Plan Funds During the Summit, the Department also will highlight existing and new investments from the philanthropic community to scale the impact of recovery efforts, particularly focused on accelerating academic recovery and providing mental health supports to students. Philanthropic efforts also will help extend the impact of the American Rescue Plan by providing financial support for schools and districts to invest in programs beyond the three years in which American Rescue Plan funds must be spent. These ongoing philanthropic efforts include: $17 million investment from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for high-impact tutoring. The Gates Foundation is investing $17 million over the next four years (2022-2025) to foster learning acceleration through high-impact tutoring, building out tools and resources so state and district leaders can more easily identify, select, and implement evidence-based tutoring programs. $14.4 million in grants from the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation throughout 2022 to support afterschool across the country . Funding priorities include $7.5 million to support the 50 State Afterschool Network to ensure effective implementation of ARP funds; nearly $2 million to support increased capacity for statewide afterschool networks to reach out to local districts that need help implementing afterschool programs using ARP funds; over $2 million to support Mizzen, an innovative online tool that delivers high-quality content for afterschool programming; and $2.4 million to support the Afterschool Alliance, among other priorities. $10 million investment from the Raikes Foundation to support organizations aimed at accelerating learning and expanding access to mental health supports. Raikes is investing to support the BELE Network, the Resource Equity Funders Collaborative focused on addressing inequities made worse by the pandemic, the Science of Learning and Development Alliance, and other organizations helping school districts to see, understand, and deploy resources to meet the unique needs of all students. Over $9 million investment from the Stuart Foundation to support summer learning, learning recovery, educator workforce, and mental health initiatives. The Stuart Foundation has committed over $9 million to organizations that provide technical assistance to school districts in effectively utilizing ARP funds, implement and support the development of new community schools, and invest in student, family and community engagement to ensure students have the academic, summer, and mental health supports they need to recover. $9 million investment from Overdeck Family Foundation to accelerate students’ academic recovery and address the teacher shortage. The Foundation invested over $7 million in grants to organizations to help students recover academically from the pandemic and $2 million in grants to help increase teacher retention efforts by scaling programs that are successful in retaining effective teachers, promote teacher diversity, and differentiate teacher roles. $4.25 million investment from the William + Flora Hewlett Foundation to provide support and technical assistance to districts on how to effectively use ARP funds and sustain recovery efforts beyond the life of ARP. The Hewlett Foundation plans to invest $1.25 million to help districts plan on how to use ARP funds, over $2 million to stand up an Improvement Network focused on recovery and evaluating the impact of various recovery strategies, and $1 million to provide tools to districts to help them analyze and implement effective recovery strategies, among other investments. $240,000 investment from the W. Clement and Jessie V. Stone Foundation to support projects to address the impacts of the pandemic on children, students and educators, and address inequities made worse by the pandemic. The Stone Foundation is investing tens of thousands of dollars in efforts to address the teacher shortage through bonuses and scholarships, improve access to mental health services for young men and boys of color, and create pathways for early childhood educators to access degrees and higher wages. The Department will invest an additional $160 million through the Education Innovation and Research Grant Program to assist with the impact of the pandemic on students and schools. In addition to helping states and districts use American Rescue Plan funds to help students recover academically and access the mental health support they need, the Department also will focus this year’s Education Innovation and Research (EIR) program on projects that develop, implement, replicate, and scaleup strategies to support learning recovery and student well-being related to the impact of COVID-19, including projects that address accelerated learning. Authorized under the Every Student Succeeds Act, the EIR program encourages field-initiated innovations that improve student achievement and attainment for underserved students. The Department will open its application process for the EIR program, providing $160 million in funding for five-year grants, prioritizing those that generate and support innovations that will help overcome the challenges to student opportunity and success exacerbated by the pandemic. Under Secretary Cardona’s leadership, the Department will fund approximately 15 to 35 projects, giving priority to projects that develop, implement, replicate, or scaleup strategies that support learning recovery and student well-being related to the impact of the pandemic, including accelerated learning. Projects that also increase student access to student-centered and project-based learning and advanced coursework also will be prioritized, as well as projects that close gaps in educational opportunities, projects that increase student access to Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM), and projects that support student social and emotional well-being.

The Department has invited 73 colleges and universities to participate in the third round of the Second Chance Pell Experiment, an initiative first launched by the Obama-Biden Administration to expand access to Federal Pell Grants for incarcerated individuals enrolled in participating programs. The expansion will bring the total number of schools able to participate in the Second Chance Pell Experiment to 200. The Department is also announcing changes to policies to help incarcerated individuals with defaulted loans, including affirming that incarcerated individuals qualify for a “fresh start,” which returns borrowers with defaulted loans to repayment in good standing and allows them to access programs like the Second Chance Pell Experiment. The Department will also allow incarcerated individuals to consolidate their loans to help them exit default in the long term. U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona and Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Amy Solomon will recognize today’s announcements by visiting DC Central Kitchen in Washington D.C. where they will have a conversation with formerly incarcerated individuals who participated in education while incarcerated. “Access to high-quality postsecondary education is essential to incarcerated individuals, but for far too long, people in prison were left out,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “The expansion of Second Chance Pell and these new pathways out of default are critical steps for incarcerated individuals to be able to access educational opportunities that will provide second chances to build a future.” The Second Chance Pell Experiment was first established in 2015 by the Obama-Biden Administration to provide Pell Grants to incarcerated individuals to allow them to participate in postsecondary education programs. To date, students have earned over 7,000 credentials , building new skills and improving their odds of success through the initiative. Today’s announcement of the expansion of 73 sites will mean that up to 200 programs will be able to participate in the program as the lead-up to the broader implementation of reinstatement of access to Pell Grants for incarcerated students starting on July 1, 2023. Selected colleges and universities will partner with federal and state penal institutions in almost all 50 states to enroll thousands of incarcerated students in educational and training programs. The vast majority of selected schools are public two- and public four-year institutions. Twenty-four of the newly selected educational institutions are HBCUs and minority-serving institutions. Selected schools may begin accessing Pell Grants as early as July 1, 2022. The Department’s announcements affirming that incarcerated individuals qualify for a “fresh start,” eliminating the impact of default on borrowers when the student loan payment pause ends, will also help more incarcerated individuals access the Second Chance Pell Experiment. Previously, incarcerated individuals interested in enrolling in the Second Chance Pell Experiment were twice as likely as the broader population to be turned away because they had defaulted loans. In addition to ensuring that incarcerated individuals benefit from the “fresh start,” the Department is also announcing a broader fix to ensure individuals have an opportunity to exit default and resume their educational journey in the long term. After Fresh Start is implemented, the Department will allow incarcerated individuals to consolidate loans to get out of default — an option available to everyone else and cut off for too long for incarcerated individuals. Providing education in prison is proven to reduce recidivism rates and is associated with higher employment rates, which will improve public safety and allow individuals to return home to their communities and contribute to society. Moreover, a 2018 study from the RAND Corporation, funded by the Department of Justice, found that incarcerated individuals who participated in correctional education were 48% less likely to return to prison within three years than incarcerated individuals who did not participate in any correctional education programs. RAND also estimated that for every dollar invested in correctional education programs, four to five dollars are saved on three-year re-incarceration costs. In December 2020, lawmakers expanded access to Pell Grants once again to include students who are incarcerated, as long as they are enrolled in prison education programs that are approved by their state corrections departments or the Federal Bureau of Prisons and that meet other requirements. The expansion of the Second Chance Pell Experiment will allow for opportunities to study the best practices for implementing the reinstatement of Pell Grant eligibility for incarcerated students, and will expand the geographic range of the programs. Expanding the experiment will also allow for a wider variety of postsecondary education programs that serve a more diverse population. The Department intends to then fully implement the legislative changes to allow eligible students in college-in-prison programs to access Federal Pell Grants beginning on July 1, 2023.

19-Apr-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/department-education-announces-actions-fix-longstanding-failures-student-loan-programs,Department of Education Announces Actions to Fix Longstanding Failures in the Student Loan Programs,"Today, the Department of Education announced steps that will bring borrowers closer to public service loan and income-driven repayment (IDR) forgiveness by addressing historical failures in the administration of the federal student loan programs. Federal Student Aid (FSA) estimates that these changes will result in immediate debt cancellation for at least 40,000 borrowers under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Program. Several thousand borrowers with older loans will also receive forgiveness through IDR. More than 3.6 million borrowers will also receive at least three years of additional credit toward IDR forgiveness. “Student loans were never meant to be a life sentence, but it’s certainly felt that way for borrowers locked out of debt relief they’re eligible for,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “Today, the Department of Education will begin to remedy years of administrative failures that effectively denied the promise of loan forgiveness to certain borrowers enrolled in IDR plans. These actions once again demonstrate the Biden-Harris administration’s commitment to delivering meaningful debt relief and ensuring federal student loan programs are administered fairly and effectively.” These actions are part of the Department’s commitment to address historical failures in the administration of the federal student loan program and support student loan borrowers through the pandemic. They also help address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on borrowers with lower incomes and high debt loads. Today’s steps will help restore the promise of IDR plans by ensuring that borrowers have an affordable and effective path out of debt. Beyond the immediate corrective actions announced today that will provide relief to borrowers harmed in the past, FSA will take action to ensure that borrowers receive these benefits in the future. Below are the actions being taken today. Ending “Forbearance Steering” Department regulations require that borrowers who are facing difficulty making their loan payments get clear and accurate information from servicers about their options for staying out of delinquency, including IDR plans, and the financial consequences of choosing short-term options like forbearance. However, FSA reviews suggest that loan servicers placed borrowers into forbearance in violation of Department rules, even when their monthly payment under an IDR plan could have been as low as zero dollars. These findings are consistent with concerns raised by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and state attorneys general. A borrower advised to choose an IDR plan instead of forbearance can get a reduced payment, stay in good standing, and make progress toward loan forgiveness. A borrower advised to choose forbearance – particularly long-term consecutive or serial uses of forbearance – can see their loan balance and monthly payments grow due to interest capitalization and lead to delinquency or default. The Department will address forbearance steering by: Conducting a One-Time Account Adjustment to Count Certain Long-Term Forbearances toward IDR and PSLF Forgiveness Borrowers steered or inappropriately placed into long-term forbearances miss out on critical progress toward IDR and PSLF forgiveness; this can set them back years. The Department’s regulations and servicer contracts have safeguards, including a 12-month limit for any single use of forbearance, and a 36-month cumulative limit on discretionary forbearance. A review of past forbearance use shows that long-term use of forbearance was remarkably widespread. More than 13% of all Direct Loan borrowers between July 2009 and March 2020 have used forbearance for at least 36 months cumulatively. These changes will be applied automatically to borrowers’ accounts later this year. To mitigate the harms of inappropriate steering into long-term forbearance, FSA will conduct a one-time account adjustment that will count forbearances of more than 12 months consecutive and more than 36 months cumulative toward forgiveness under IDR and PSLF. Borrowers who were steered into shorter-term forbearances will be able to seek account review by filing a complaint with the FSA Ombudsman at StudentAid.gov/feedback . Increasing Oversight of Servicers’ Forbearance Use FSA will target forbearance steering by restricting servicers’ ability to enroll borrowers in forbearance by text or email, conducting an external review of patterns of forbearance use and servicers’ practices to identify other potential changes to address steering, and working in partnership with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to do regular audits of forbearance use. This will build upon other FSA efforts to improve oversight of loan servicing activities, including stronger accountability provisions in servicing contracts , renewing partnerships with federal and state regulators and clarifying its position on federal preemption of state oversight of loan servicing. FSA will begin implementing these changes immediately, but borrowers may not see the effect in their accounts until the last quarter of 2022. Tracking Progress Toward IDR Forgiveness IDR plans offer substantially lower monthly payments for most borrowers. Borrowers on most plans are entitled to forgiveness after 20 years of payments and depend on FSA and its servicers to accurately track their progress toward relief. However, the Department’s review of IDR payment-tracking procedures has revealed significant flaws that suggest borrowers are missing out on progress toward IDR forgiveness. The Department is committed to fixing this problem swiftly and permanently. Secretary Cardona has directed FSA to: Conduct a One-Time Revision of IDR Payments to Address Past Inaccuracies To fully address past issues with IDR payment counting, FSA will do a one-time revision of IDR-qualifying payments for all Direct Student Loans and federally-managed Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFEL) loans. Any months in which borrowers made payments will count toward IDR, regardless of repayment plan. Payments made prior to consolidation on consolidated loans will also count. This fix is necessary to correct for data problems and past implementation inaccuracies. Any borrower who has made the required number of payments for IDR forgiveness based on this payment-count revision will receive loan cancellation automatically. Additionally, FSA will count months spent in deferment prior to 2013 toward IDR forgiveness (with the exception of in-school deferment) for this same population of borrowers to address concerns that, prior to that date, its data cannot distinguish IDR-eligible deferments from other deferments. Permanently Fix IDR Payment Counting by Reforming FSA's IDR Tracking Borrowers should be able to rely on FSA and its loan servicers to keep accurate records of their progress toward forgiveness through IDR plans. FSA will issue new guidance to student loan servicers to ensure accurate and uniform payment counting practices, and it will track payment counts in its own modernized data systems. In 2023, FSA will begin displaying IDR payment counts on StudentAid.gov so borrowers can view their progress after logging into their accounts. In addition, the Department plans to revise the terms of IDR through rulemaking to further simplify payment counting by allowing more loan statuses to count toward IDR forgiveness, including certain types of deferments and forbearances. FSA will begin implementing these changes immediately, but borrowers may not see the effect in their accounts until the last quarter of 2022. Tackling Student Debt From Day One, the Biden-Harris Administration has been committed to making student loan relief programs work for everyone, including by addressing failures that deny borrowers the benefits they earned. Efforts to revise IDR regulations will produce substantially more affordable monthly payments for millions of borrowers. Today’s actions complement steps the Administration has already taken within its first year to cancel more than $17 billion in debt for 725,000 borrowers in addition to extending the student loan payment pause, saving 41 million borrowers billions of dollars in payments each month. The Department has now approved approximately: $6.8 billion for more than 113,000 public servants through improvements to PSLF; $7.8 billion for more than 400,000 borrowers who have a total and permanent disability; $1.2 billion for borrowers who attended ITT Technical Institutes before it closed; and Nearly $2 billion to 105,000 borrowers who were defrauded by their school. To make college more affordable for current and future students, President Biden has called for and Congress has included in bipartisan legislation a $400 increase in the maximum Federal Pell Grant—the largest increase in the maximum award in over a decade. To protect students and taxpayers from predatory or low-value colleges, the Department has also restored the FSA Office of Enforcement and started efforts to strengthen key rules including borrower defense to repayment and gainful employment."

The Department’s summit will convene educators, parents and families, philanthropists, government officials, and students to discuss the ways the American Rescue Plan investments are making a difference this school year and beyond and highlight best practices communities should adopt as leaders, educators, and families work together to address the pandemic’s impact on our students. The virtual summit, From Recovery to Thriving: How the American Rescue Plan is Supporting America’s Students, will occur Wednesday, April 27, in the afternoon. The Department, in partnership with the National Public Education Support Fund , will bring together education leaders, advocates and philanthropic partners to discuss how to help students and schools recover from the pandemic. “Thanks to American Rescue Plan funds, schools are open for in-person learning, but that is just the beginning” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “By working together, leveraging partnerships between the public and private sectors that put students first, we can meet this moment and make sure our school communities have the supports they need fueled by the American Rescue Plan. As we recover from the pandemic, we are seeing states and schools using federal dollars to provide additional mental health and academic resources, education advocates working together to strengthen those efforts, and educators collaborating with parents, families, and school communities to ensure transparency and accountability as they deliver much-needed supports. The summit will provide an opportunity for schools, educators, parents, families, students, advocates, government officials, and more to convene, share best practices, and learn about the ways these funds are making a real difference.” The opening panel and subsequent learning sessions will create opportunities to support school districts and states in utilizing their federal funds to deepen and scale strategies to address learning recovery, mental health support, and labor shortages during and beyond the three years of American Rescue Plan funding so students can recover and thrive in the future. Additional panels will convene conversations focused on the needs facing schools across the country and collaborative efforts to address them.

14-Apr-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/department-education-releases-equity-action-plan-part-biden-harris-administrations-efforts-advance-racial-equity-and-support-underserved-communities,Department of Education Releases Equity Action Plan as Part of Biden-Harris Administration's Efforts to Advance Racial Equity and Support Underserved Communities,"Today, the U.S. Department of Education released its inaugural equity action plan as part of the Biden-Harris Administration's continued commitment to advancing racial equity and support for underserved communities through the federal government. This plan aligns with President Biden's executive order, Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government . As the Department works to help schools, communities, students, educators, and families recover from the pandemic and rebuild stronger than before March 2020, advancing equity and closing gaps made worse by the pandemic remain a core priority. U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona underscored this priority earlier this year when he laid out his vision for education in America . The Department's equity action plan builds on current processes already in place and implements new strategies to ensure the advancement of equity as it works to promote student achievement and ensure the nation's education system meets the demands of today's global economy. ""Education has the power to bring the American Dream within reach of every individual, lift communities, draw people together, drive our economy, and meet our nation's vast potential,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""We need to keep the focus on transforming our education system so it trulyexpands opportunity for all students, no matter their race, background, zip code, age, or family's income.Together, we must take bold action to ensure our nation's schools are defined not by disparities, but by equity and excellence, especially as we recover from the pandemic and reemerge stronger than before."" To deal with both ongoing recovery efforts from the pandemic and begin to remedy long-standing disparities that underserved students and communities face in achieving equal education opportunities, the Department is announcing a series of plans to incorporate equity throughout its operations and mission to meet the needs of every learner. These additional efforts by the Department include: Prioritizing access to and completion of an education beyond high school. Postsecondary attainment continues to be inequitably available for traditionally underserved populations as accessibility, affordability, and equitable funding across institutions remain barriers to earning a postsecondary degree or certificate. To improve access and affordability, the Department will review and improve its model used to verify financial aid applicants. The Department also intends to undertake a comprehensive approach to provide for equitable funding by: investing in Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Tribally Controlled Colleges and Universities,and minority-serving institutions such as Hispanic-Serving Institutions, Predominantly Black Institutions, and Asian American Pacific Islander Serving Institutions, community colleges, and other under-resourced public institutions; supporting institutions, systems, and states to raise completion rates for underserved students; and sponsoring a new vision of college excellence that makes inclusivity a marker of prestige. Ensuring equitable impact of American Rescue Plan's $130 billion in funding for K-12 students. Certain student groups have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic, including but not limited to students from low-income backgrounds, students with disabilities, multilingual learners, students experiencing homelessness, and migratory students. The Department is committed to the American Rescue Plan's (ARP) intended purpose of helping schools and communities recover from the pandemic. The Department will also continue to support State Educational Agencies (SEA) and Local Educational Entities (LEA) in meeting and enforcing the requirements of the ARPElementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund's first of its kind Maintenance of Equity requirement, which ensures that SEAs and LEAs do not disproportionately reduce per-pupil funding to districts and schools and that SEAs do not cut funding at all for the highest poverty districts. Investing in resources to help advance civil rights. Advancing equity rests on the presumption of equal opportunities and protection under the law. The Department's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) made the historic decision to collect data from the 2020-21 and 2021-22 school years, marking the first time OCR has conducted civil rights data collection from all public schools two school years in a row instead of every other year. The additional collection will allow the Department to identify inequities in educational opportunities as the country continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on students' academic, social, and emotional development. Advancing equity in contracting and procurement. Minority owned small businesses receive about 20 percent of total agency procurement actions, but they receive significantly fewer overall dollars. In response, the Department is identifying opportunities to award higher dollar actions to minority owned small businesses, consistent with the authorizing statute and regulations governing minority owned small business contract awards. Additionally, the Department will work with its Senior Executive Service (SES) to ensure executive performance plans address progress towards our achievement of the small business contracting goals. Advancing equity in grant process strategies. The Department pursues its mission by funding programs that will improve access to high-quality educational opportunities and programs that pursue innovations in teaching and learning with a focus on underserved students. Each year the Department convenes panels of external education professionals and practitioners to serve as peer reviewers. To advance equity in the grants process, the Department will expand its outreach efforts to attract the broadest possible pool of reviewers. These actions build on work the Department has initiated throughout the first year of the Biden-Harris Administration to deliver on equity and racial justice. Some components already put forth by the Department include: Supporting America's education system through the COVID-19 pandemic. The Department distributed unprecedented resources to states, districts, K-12 schools, and postsecondary institutions, including funding, guidance, and technical assistance to help educators meet the needs of all students, especially those disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. Supporting Schools with High-Poverty Rates to Address Opportunity and Achievement Gaps. Title I helps schools provide students in low-income communities the learning opportunities and supports they need to succeed, and addresses long-standing funding disparities between under-resourced schools – which disproportionately serve students of color – and their wealthier counterparts. The Department continues to administer these funds that serve 25 million students in nearly 90 percent of school districts across the nation. President Biden's FY23 budget proposal calls for $36.5 billion for Title I, more than doubling the program's funding compared to the 2021 enacted level. Within the requested Title I funding, it would provide resources for SEAs to voluntarily establish commissions to identify and create plans to address inequities in their education funding systems and gaps in access to educational opportunity, and funding for similar reviews at the district level. Investing in Educator Recruitment and Retention. As states, districts, and schools are working hard to address the impact of COVID-19 on students' social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs, many of them are facing significant challenges in attracting and retaining teachers. Research shows that existing educator shortages disproportionately impact students of color, students from low-income backgrounds, students with disabilities, and, often, rural communities. The Department continues to take action to support and invest in the teaching profession and address the teacher shortage many schools and districts across the country face. Supporting higher education with pandemic relief funding. The Department distributed $40 billion through the American Rescue Plan to more than 5,000 colleges and universities to help students access a high-quality education and the academic, emotional, and financial supports needed to thrive and safely return to on-campus, in-person instruction and activities. ARP provided more than $16 billion to our nation's HBCUs, Tribally Controlled Colleges and Universities and minority-serving institutions. Advancing equity through Title IX. The Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights launched a comprehensive review of its existing regulations and other actions related to Title IX, which prohibits sex discrimination in education programs and activities that receive federal funding. Supporting learners with disabilities. The Department invested more than $3 billion in ARP funds to support children with disabilities who were disproportionately impacted by the pandemic and its disruptions to in-person learning. Supporting student loan borrowers. The Department has redoubled its efforts to support student loan borrowers, many of whom have struggled with unemployment, reduced work hours, and other financial stressors brought on by the pandemic. The Department's initial efforts to provide targeted loan relief have already led to the approval of $17 billion in student loan cancellation for more than 700,000 borrowers, including $1.5 billion to borrowers who have been taken advantage of by their institutions, $7.8 billion for over 400,000 borrowers who have a total and permanent disability, and $1.26 billion to over 100,000 borrowers who attended the now-defunct ITT Technical Institute. In October 2021, the Department also revamped the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program, which allows borrowers to study for and work in jobs that may be lower-paying without being overly burdened by student loan debt, announcing changes to the program to allow borrowers to receive credit for past periods of repayment on loans that may not otherwise qualify for PSLF. Focusing on equity as a priority of the administration. The Secretary's Supplemental Priorities, which became effective on January 10, 2022, contain six priorities of the administration, with the second priority focusing on Promoting Equity in Student Access to Educational Resources and Opportunities. The priority enables program offices within the Department to focus strategic plans, competitions and projects in ways that promote educational equity and adequacy in resources and opportunity for underserved students. The detailed action plan can be found here . Following the release of the Department's plan, the Department will host a listening session on May 17, 2022 which will be led by senior agency officials to hear feedback on the equity action plan. More details on the listening session to come."
7-Apr-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/education-department-continues-push-invest-highly-effective-educators-and-address-teacher-shortage,Education Department Continues Push to Invest in Highly Effective Educators and Address Teacher Shortage,"The U.S. Department of Education is continuing to take action to support and invest in the teaching profession and address the teacher shortage many schools and districts across the country face. The Supporting Effective Educator Development (SEED) grant program is now accepting applications for efforts that increase the pipeline of highly effective educators. The SEED program will award $65 million to support the implementation of evidence-based practices that prepare, develop, or enhance the skills of educators. These grants also will enable recipients to develop, expand, and evaluate practices that can serve as models that can be sustained, replicated, and scaled. This program is part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s broader commitment to supporting targeted efforts that will provide comprehensive, high-quality pathways into the profession, such as residency and Grow Your Own programs, and evidence-based professional development all focused on building and supporting a more diverse educator pipeline and combating the teacher shortage nationally. “We know that in order to improve education across the country and meet our students where they are, we must invest in teacher professional learning, recruitment, and retention. This past year, we heard from our educators, parents, and leaders that investing in teachers is investing in students. We are ready to act on that!” said Secretary Cardona. “This grant competition will support institutions of higher education, national nonprofits, and other eligible partners that provide teachers and school leaders with effective strategies for building inclusive, unbiased, and safe learning environments that support the academic, social, and emotional needs of every student. Building an education system that is the best in the world requires an investment in our dedicated teachers.” As states, districts, and schools are working hard to address the impact of COVID-19 on students’ social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs, many of them are facing significant challenges in attracting and retaining teachers. Preexisting teacher shortages in critical areas such as special education; multilingual education; science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM); career and technical education; and early childhood education have only been further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic—directly impeding student access to educational opportunity. The SEED program fosters the use of rigorous evidence-based practices in selecting and implementing strategies and interventions that support educators’ development across the continuum of their careers. Support for educator preparation programs and high-quality professional development are vital to ensure that all students have access to well-prepared and qualified teachers, principals, and other school leaders. These programs invest in educators who are effective and likely to stay in the profession. Research shows that existing educator shortages disproportionately impact students of color, students from low-income backgrounds, students with disabilities, and, often, rural communities. Coinciding with today’s announcement, this afternoon the Department is hosting a webinar focused on “Strengthening Partnerships Between States, School Districts, and Higher Education to Increase the Number of Teacher Candidates Prepared to Enter the Classroom and Provide Immediate Support to Schools.” During the webinar, Education Department representatives will discuss Secretary Cardona’s recent call to action for states, institutions of higher education, and school districts to commit to using American Rescue Plan and other federal relief funds to help address teacher shortages. Representatives also will share how federal relief funds and opportunities through the U.S. Department of Labor can and are being used to address teacher shortages and provide support to schools by establishing or scaling up teaching residency and apprenticeship programs. To join today’s webinar, please register here . A Zoom link will be provided after registration. The Department recognizes the value of supporting educators and is committed to providing resources and opportunities that uplift the educator workforce.

The FY 2022 SEED grant competition will close on June 3, 2022."
6-Apr-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-extends-student-loan-pause-through-august-31,Biden-Harris Administration Extends Student Loan Pause Through August 31,"Today, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) announced an extension of the pause on student loan repayment, interest, and collections through August 31, 2022. While the economy continues to improve and COVID cases continue to decline, President Biden has made clear the continuing need to respond to the pandemic and its economic consequences, as well as to allow for the responsible phase-down of pandemic relief. The extension will provide additional time for borrowers to plan for the resumption of payments, reducing the risk of delinquency and defaults after restart. During the extension, the Department will continue to assess the financial impacts of the pandemic on student loan borrowers and to prepare to transition borrowers smoothly back into repayment. This includes allowing all borrowers with paused loans to receive a “fresh start” on repayment by eliminating the impact of delinquency and default and allowing them to reenter repayment in good standing. The Department will also continue to provide loan relief, including to borrowers who have been defrauded by their institutions and those eligible for relief through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. FSA will establish new partnerships to ensure that borrowers working in public service are automatically credited with progress toward forgiveness, eliminating paperwork that prevents many borrowers from getting help. FSA will also continue to transfer loans to servicers committed to working under new, stronger accountability rules. “The Department of Education is committed to ensuring that student loan borrowers have a smooth transition back to repayment,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “This additional extension will allow borrowers to gain more financial security as the economy continues to improve and as the nation continues to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. It remains a top priority for the Biden-Harris Administration to support students, families, and borrowers – especially those disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. During the pause, we will continue our preparations to give borrowers a fresh start and to ensure that all borrowers have access to repayment plans that meet their financial situations and needs.” More information about the payment pause and supports for borrowers can be found at StudentAid.gov . Today’s action is one in a series of steps the Biden-Harris Administration has taken to support students and borrowers, make an education beyond high school more affordable, and improve student loan servicing. In just over one year, the Department has provided over $17 billion in targeted loan relief to over 700,000 borrowers. Actions within that include: Revamping the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program in October, which has already allowed the Department to identify more than 100,000 borrowers eligible for $6.4 billion in loan relief. As part of that effort, the Department implemented a Limited PSLF Waiver to count all prior payments made by student borrowers toward PSLF, regardless of the loan program. Borrowers who are working in public service but have not yet applied for PSLF should do so before October 31, 2022, and can find out more at StudentAid.gov/PSLF. Providing $7.8 billion in relief for more than 400,000 borrowers who have a total and permanent disability. Approving $2 billion in borrower defense claims to approximately 107,000 borrowers, including extending full relief to approved claims and approving new types of claims. Providing $1.26 billion in closed school discharges to 107,000 borrowers who attended the now-defunct ITT Technical Institute. Helping 30,000 small business owners with student loans seeking help from the Paycheck Protection Program."
5-Apr-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-educations-office-civil-rights-announces-resolution-sexual-harassment-investigation-chino-valley-unified-school-district-california,U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights Announces Resolution of Sexual Harassment Investigation of Chino Valley Unified School District in California,"The U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) today announced the resolution of a sexual harassment investigation of the Chino Valley Unified School District in San Bernardino County, California. OCR determined that the district violated Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and its implementing regulations by failing to provide an effective response to notice of sexual harassment among members of a school athletics team in fall 2017. The office found that some team members subjected their fellow teammates to sexual harassment on the team bus, in the locker and weight rooms, and in the Athletics Physical Education classroom that was sufficiently serious so as to limit their ability to access the athletics program. OCR further found that this harassment created a hostile educational environment for team members who reported they were disgusted and shocked by the harassment, avoided the locker room and the team’s social media to avoid such harassment, sought counseling, and feared becoming the targets of harassment and considered leaving the school and team. The harassing conduct included videotaped assaults of teammates, students forcibly physically overpowering other students and sharing photos of their genitals among the team and on social media and placing their genitals on and near other students’ faces and bodies. Evidence reflected that the student harassers directed other students not to say anything about what happened to avoid getting in trouble. The response from school staff, including coaches, to these incidents was not reasonably calculated to end the harassing conduct or prevent its recurrence. Likewise, the district's response following investigations reflected an inability to address adequately the conduct and a failure to consider interim supportive measures to protect student athletes from sexual harassment. The resolution agreement commits the district to necessary steps to ensure nondiscrimination in its schools. “I thank Chino Valley Unified School District for its commitment now to ensure that its athletics program and other school activities will be free from sexual harassment, and to take steps necessary to support students subject to past harassment in school,” said Catherine E. Lhamon, assistant secretary for civil rights. The district’s commitments to resolve the investigation include: Contacting all former athletes from the school’s fall 2017 team and offering counseling services or reimbursement for such services received to address the effects of the district’s failure to address known sexual harassment on the team. Conducting a climate survey for the school’s athletics team. Training district and school administrators and interscholastic coaching staff about their responsibilities for responding effectively to sexual harassment. Conducting ongoing Title IX education for student athletes in the district’s athletics program to ensure that they know how to recognize and report sexual harassment. And, Reporting to OCR about the district’s training and responses to complaints of sexual harassment through the end of the 2022-2023 school year. April is Sexual Assault Awareness Month. OCR is committed to ensuring nondiscrimination in schools, including with respect to sexual assault. The letter to Chino Valley Unified School District is available here and the resolution agreement is available here ."
31-Mar-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/secretary-cardona-rep-soto-join-roundtable-lgbtqi-students-and-families-florida-transgender-day-visibility,"Secretary Cardona, Rep. Soto Join Roundtable with LGBTQI+ Students and Families from Florida on Transgender Day of Visibility","Today, U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona and Florida Congressman Darren Soto met with Floridian LGBTQI+ students and families on Transgender Day of Visibility and participated in a closed press, roundtable discussion to hear about the impact that recent anti-LGBTQI+ legislation has on them, and their communities and school experiences. Throughout the roundtable, Secretary Cardona and Rep. Soto affirmed the Biden-Harris Administration's support for the LGBTQI+ community, shared mental health and other resources available from the federal government, and heard from students and families about stress and fear recent anti-LGBTQI+ legislation has caused for them. ""On Transgender Day of Visibility and every day, the Biden-Harris administration is proud of our nation's transgender students and educators,"" said Secretary Cardona. ""It's essential for schools to be welcoming environments for teaching and learning. And it's vital for teachers and school staff to know, see, and support their transgender students, along with all students. Transgender students should have every opportunity to thrive in school. We know while many transgender students experience valuable support at school, many others face significant challenges because of hostility directed at them by others. This includes a growing number of state laws that bully and intimidate LGBTQI+ students and their families. To transgender students everywhere, I want you to know that we see you, we hear you, we recognize what is happening, and we're here to support you."" ""On this Transgender Day of Visibility, it was an honor to host Secretary Cardona at The Center in Orlando and listen to families affected by the 'Don't Say Gay' bill and other anti-LGBTQI+ legislation,"" said Rep. Soto. ""Though we are extremely disappointed in our governor for signing off on these harmful laws, I am hopeful that our community will prevail in the face of hatred and come back stronger than ever. I hope all LGBTQI+ students in Central Florida and across the nation know that they have allies in the highest levels of government who will stand up for them."" ""I don't understand why people, especially adults, are trying to erase my identity. It feels like I'm not even here. I just want to play on the sports team. I want to be who I am, and I want to be on a team with my friends. It's just not okay,"" said 10-year-old Dempsey Jara, a transgender girl who participated in the roundtable conversation. ""I'm here as a parent, and as a mother to a beautiful child and also as a public school teacher. This bill is not about indoctrinating children to become transgender. This is about pretending that LGBTQI+ students do not exist. They do exist, they're here. And for many of my students, the only safe space they have is my classroom. And this bill takes that away. I won't stand for it as a parent and I won't stand for it as a teacher,"" said Jaime Jara, who participated in the roundtable conversation. One by one, the students and families shared some of the concerns and fears they are facing as the threat of these bills becomes more apparent. Following Gov. DeSantis signing the Parental Rights in Education bill, Secretary Cardona shared this statement expressing the Biden Administration's support for LGBTQI+ students."
28-Mar-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/statement-secretary-education-miguel-cardona-newly-signed-florida-state-legislation,Statement by Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona on Newly Signed Florida State Legislation,"U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona today issued the following statement in response to the Florida Legislature's Parental Rights in Education bill being signed into law: “By signing this bill, Gov. DeSantis has chosen to target some of Florida’s most vulnerable students and families, all while under the guise of 'parents' rights.' Make no mistake: this is a part of a disturbing and dangerous trend across the country of legislation targeting LGBTQI+ students, educators, and individuals. This comes at a time when we know lesbian, gay, bisexual, and questioning students are three to four times more likely than non-LGBTQI+ students to report experiencing persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and even self harm – not because of who they are but because of the hostility directed at them. I’ve spoken to parents and families in Florida and they’ve consistently told me that this legislation doesn’t represent them or what they stand for. Instead of telling some students or families it’s not okay to be who they are, our Department is fighting for dignity and opportunity for every student and family. We will continue to prioritize getting billions of dollars of American Rescue Plan funds into schools and classrooms across the country to support the mental health and academic needs of students, educators, and families. And, we will be monitoring this law upon implementation to evaluate whether it violates federal civil rights law. As always, any student who believes they are experiencing discrimination, including harassment, at school or any parent who is concerned that about their child experiencing discrimination can file a complaint with our Office for Civil Rights.”"
28-Mar-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/statement-secretary-education-miguel-cardona-presidents-fiscal-year-2023-budget,Statement by Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona on the President’s Fiscal Year 2023 Budget,"The Biden-Harris Administration today submitted to Congress the President's Budget for fiscal year 2023. The President's Budget details his vision to expand on the historic progress our country has made over the last year and deliver the agenda he laid out in his State of the Union address—to build a better America, reduce the deficit, reduce costs for families, and grow the economy from the bottom up and middle out. ""Federal budgets are an expression of values. This proposal reflects the Biden-Harris Administration's deep belief in the importance of education and the success and wellbeing of our nation's students. It's my hope that Congress answers the President's call for continued investments that help our schools hire and support more teachers, school counselors, and other personnel who can nurture the social, emotional, and academic development and mental well-being of our children and youth in this critical time and beyond."" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""Across the country, we must focus our efforts on recovery. That means ensuring all students—especially those from underserved communities and those most impacted by the pandemic—receive the resources they need to thrive. Importantly, this budget also invests in access to affordable higher education and the creation of stronger pathways that meet the demands of our workforce and connect students to well-paying jobs and fulfilling careers."" The budget will help lay a stronger foundation for shared growth and prosperity for generations to come and make critical investments in core areas that align with Secretary Cardona's vision for education in America . At the U.S. Department of Education, the budget would: Support students through pandemic response and recovery . Disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic continue to take a toll on the physical and mental health of students, educators, and school staff. Recognizing the profound connection between physical health, mental health, and student's social and emotional well-being, and academic success, among other investments, the budget includes a $1 billion investment to increase the number of counselors, nurses, school psychologists, social workers, and other health professionals in schools, and a $468 million investment in Full-Service Community Schools and partnerships to provide integrated student supports. Provide Historic Investments in Schools with High-Poverty Rates to Boldly Address Opportunity and Achievement Gaps. To advance the goal of providing a high-quality education to every student, the budget includes $36.5 billion for Title I, including $20.5 billion in discretionary funding and $16 billion in mandatory funding, more than doubling the program's funding compared to the 2021 enacted level. Title I helps schools provide students in low-income communities the learning opportunities and supports they need to succeed. This substantial new support for the program, which serves 25 million students in nearly 90 percent of school districts across the nation, would be a major step toward fulfilling the President's commitment to addressing long-standing funding disparities between under-resourced schools – which disproportionately serve students of color – and their wealthier counterparts. The request includes a set-aside to support voluntary state and local efforts to identify gaps in educational resources and opportunities and a path forward to advance equity in student opportunities and outcomes. Increase Support for Children with Disabilities. To ensure that children and youth with disabilities receive the services and support they need to thrive in school and graduate ready for college or career, the budget provides $16.3 billion for IDEA Grants to states, a $3.3 billion increase over the 2021 enacted level – the largest two-year increase ever for the program. The increased funds would support special education and related services for approximately 7.4 million students in grades Pre-K through 12. The budget also doubles funding to $932 million for IDEA Part C grants, which support early intervention services for infants and families with disabilities that have a proven record of improving academic and developmental outcomes. The increased funding would support states in implementing critical reforms to expand their enrollment of underserved children, including children of color, children from low-income families, and children living in rural areas. The budget also more than doubles funding to $250 million for IDEA Personnel Preparation grants to support a pipeline of special educators at a time when the majority of states are experiencing a shortage of special educators. Invest in Educator Recruitment and Retention . While the education sector has faced shortages in critical staffing areas for decades, which disproportionately impact students of color and students from low-income backgrounds, the COVID-19 pandemic and tight labor market has made shortages worse, negatively impacting the education students receive and falling hardest on students in underserved communities. In addition to comprehensive investments across several programs to support a diverse and well-prepared pipeline of educators, the budget includes $514 million for the Education Innovation and Research program, of which the Department would target $350 million towards identifying and scaling models that improve recruitment and retention of staff in education, including models that would improve resources and support for educators, and provide teacher access to leadership opportunities that improve teacher retention and expand the impact of great teachers within and beyond their classrooms. Reimagine the High School to Postsecondary Education Transition. Reimagining traditional educational pathways to improve equitable opportunities is a critical component of the President's vision to increase successful outcomes for all students. The budget provides a new $200 million investment in Career-Connected High Schools, an initiative that would support competitive grants to partnerships of local educational agencies, institutions of higher education – including community colleges – and employers, to support early enrollment in postsecondary and career-connected coursework; work-based learning opportunities; and academic and career-connected instruction across the last two years of high school and the first two years of postsecondary education. Make Historic Investments in College Affordability. To increase equitable and affordable access to an education beyond high school, the budget would increase the maximum Pell Grant by $2,175 over the 2021-2022 award year, through a combination of discretionary and mandatory funding, helping an estimated 6.7 million students from low- and middle-income backgrounds overcome financial barriers. This historic increase is a significant step in the budget's comprehensive proposal to double the maximum Pell Grant by 2029. In addition to these critical investments, the Administration continues to support expanding federal student aid, including Pell Grant eligibility, to Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients, commonly known as DREAMers. Increase Equitable Funding for HBCUs, TCCUs, and MSIs to Support More Inclusive Higher Education. The budget would enhance institutional capacity at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Tribally Controlled Colleges and Universities (TCCUs), Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs), and low-resourced institutions, including community colleges, by providing an increase of $752 million over the 2021 enacted level. This funding includes a $450 million initiative to expand research and development infrastructure at four-year HBCUs, TCCUs, and MSIs. Increase Support for Civil Rights Enforcement. The budget provides $161 million to the Department's Office for Civil Rights, a 23 percent increase compared to the 2021 enacted level. This additional funding would ensure that the Department has the capacity to protect equal access to education through the enforcement of civil rights laws, such as Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. The budget makes these smart investments while also reducing deficits and improving our country's long-term fiscal outlook.

Today's announcement builds on President Biden's call in the State of the Union encouraging leaders to use American Rescue Plan funds to address this critical challenge schools and districts across the country are facing. The call to action coincides with Secretary Cardona's participation in the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching's Summit on Improvement in Education in San Diego. ""I have always known that a well-prepared, well-supported, well-compensated, and diverse educator workforce is the foundation for student success. Educator vacancies and other staff shortages represent a real challenge as our schools work to recover, falling hardest on students of color, students in rural communities, students from low-income backgrounds, students with disabilities, and multilingual learners. That's why I'm proud that the American Rescue Plan has equipped states, school districts, and colleges and universities that prepare our educators with unprecedented financial resources to help overcome this challenge,"" said Secretary Cardona. ""Today, I am calling on states, districts, and institutions of higher education to use ARP funds to address the teacher shortage and increase the number of teacher candidates prepared to enter the teaching profession. My team will continue to advise state and local leaders on how they can seize this moment; put COVID relief dollars to work in our schools; and achieve a lasting, equitable recovery for our students."" To coincide with the Secretary's call to action, the Department released a fact sheet providing concrete examples of how states, districts, and schools are already taking up the call to use federal COVID dollars to strengthen the teacher pipeline, get more educators in the classroom, and accelerate student recovery. Districts and higher education institutions are partnering to create and expand residency programs, offer paraprofessional internships, get college students in the classroom more quickly, and more. Because of these partnerships, students across the country can spend more time working with qualified educators and addressing the academic impact of COVID-19. To view the Department of Education fact sheet, click HERE . Secretary Cardona, a former teacher himself, is calling on school and state leaders to work together to level-up the teacher pipeline and get more qualified adults in the classroom immediately across the country. In order to accelerate student recovery, he is urging states and schools to use funds provided by the American Rescue Plan and other federal COVID-19 relief funds to scale up educator preparation programs (EPPs) at institutions of higher education and look for dynamic and innovative ways to provide hands-on learning for prospective teachers or paraprofessionals in a classroom environment. In his speech, Secretary Cardona will issue a call to action with clear deliverables for states, districts, and institutions of higher education. Using Higher Education Emergency Relief Funds ( HEERF ), Governor's Emergency Education Relief ( GEER ), and Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief ( ESSER ) funds these groups can create bold and innovative paths to the teaching profession. To increase the number of teacher candidates prepared to enter the profession in the fall and beyond, Secretary Cardona is calling on states to commit to: Establish teaching as a Registered Apprenticeship. The U.S. Department of Labor has approved standards that create an easy pathway for states to establish and use apprenticeship funding to support teaching residencies, allowing teacher apprentices to earn a good wage while learning the skills – on-the-job and through higher education partners and their integrated coursework – necessary to provide a quality education to our nation's students. Registered Apprenticeship is an effective ""earn and learn"" model with a long history of establishing career pathways in various industries by providing structured, paid on-the-job learning experiences combined with job-related technical instruction with a mentor that leads to a nationally recognized credential. To learn more about Registered Apprenticeships , visit apprenticeship.gov . Invest in evidence-based teacher residency programs. States can provide grant funding to increase the number of partnerships between and districts that support teaching residencies. Establish or expand loan forgiveness or service scholarship programs. These programs can also include a commitment to teach in a high-need area for a minimum number of years. Increase teacher compensation. Provide a competitive and livable wage, including increasing starting salaries and salary caps for teachers. To increase the number of teacher candidates prepared to enter the profession in the fall and beyond, Secretary Cardona is calling on districts to commit to: Increase the number of partnerships between EPPs and districts that support teaching residencies and schools. Teacher residents, as part of their clinical experience, can serve in schools as substitutes, paraprofessionals, or tutors as their academic schedules allow and as they complete requirements for teacher certification. Increase the availability of qualified teacher residents to support educators, students, and staff. Districts can partner with institutions of higher education to provide additional supports to educators and students through the use of teaching candidates. To increase the number of teacher candidates prepared to enter the profession in the fall and beyond, Secretary Cardona is calling on institutions of higher education and EPPs to commit to: Increase the number of teaching residency programs and program capacity. Teacher residents, as part of their clinical experiences, can serve in schools as substitute teachers, paraprofessionals, or tutors as their academic schedules allow and as they complete requirements for teacher certification. An institution could use its HEERF institutional funds to expand its teacher training programs in response to the pandemic through such measures as hiring additional faculty and staff; providing stipends, scholarships, or other students aid; and creating additional course offerings. Work with states to establish teaching as a Registered Apprenticeship. The U.S. Department of Labor has approved standards that create an easy pathway for states to establish and use apprenticeship funding to support teaching residencies. As previously described, Registered Apprenticeship is an effective ""earn and learn"" model with a long history of establishing career pathways in various industries by providing structured, paid on-the-job learning experiences combined with job-related technical instruction with a mentor that leads to a nationally recognized credential. To learn more about Registered Apprenticeships , visit apprenticeship.gov . Establish or expand loan forgiveness or service scholarship programs. These programs can also include a commitment to teach in a high need area for a minimum number of years."

Cardona and U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier Becerra today reaffirmed their commitment to children and youth by launching a joint-department effort to expand school-based health services, ensuring children have the health services and supports necessary to build resilience and thrive. The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged the health and wellbeing of the Nation's children and youth further exacerbated preexisting inequities. Throughout the country, childcare centers, schools, after-school programs, and recreational activities closed, disconnecting nearly 60 million children and youth from essential resources and supports. Many families faced job loss, economic hardship, and food insecurity, profoundly affecting child health and wellbeing. The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to supporting our Nation's children, and empowering them and their communities to help them thrive. This is why the HHS and the ED have joined together to provide additional technical assistance, resources and support to schools that will provide guidance on the federal funding available for school-based physical and behavioral health services, including how Medicaid can support the delivery of these services; help reduce federal administrative burden for states and localities, including local educational agencies, and barriers to the provision of school-based physical and behavioral health services; and improve and strengthen access to physical and behavioral health services. ""Our nation's children have been particularly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including significant impacts on their mental health,"" the Secretaries said. ""Youth reports of psychological distress have doubled since the pandemic began, with 25 percent reporting depressive symptoms and 20 percent reporting anxiety symptoms... Children and youth with intellectual or developmental disabilities and those with prior childhood trauma are at particular risk for pandemic-related mental health challenges, as are those who have faced previous discrimination in the health care system, including children and youth of color, immigrant children, children with disabilities, and those who are LGBTQ+."" ""While the pandemic's long-term impacts on children and youth are not fully understood, working together to build resilience in children, youth, and families can promote equity and support recovery efforts,"" the Secretaries continued. ""We will elevate opportunities under the American Rescue Plan funding along with existing federal resources to build a lasting and sustainable health care infrastructure for our children and youth. We welcome and encourage your engagement, questions, and partnership on any of the resources we have published. Our joint effort will build on progress made, as both Departments work together to make accessible, quality health services in schools a reality for all children and youth."" As part of this effort, ED and HHS will be co-hosting a webinar for next Wednesday, March 30 at 3 p.m. ET that will highlight successful models of health center service delivery in schools, as well as approaches, needs, and opportunities to support partnerships between schools and health centers.

23-Mar-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-announces-steps-hold-institutions-accountable-taxpayer-losses-0,U.S. Department of Education Announces Steps to Hold Institutions Accountable for Taxpayer Losses,"The U.S. Department of Education (Department) today announced updated steps to ensure that companies that own institutions are held responsible for funds owed to the federal government, including liabilities arising from closed school loan discharges and borrower defense to repayment claims. This will ensure that even if a school closes, the Department can recover funds from entities that had a direct or indirect ownership interest in the school instead of leaving the bill to taxpayers. These new procedures will protect taxpayers, students, and borrowers through incentivizing better performance by the schools and allowing the Department to recover liabilities from corporate owners. “If a company owns, controls, or profits from a college, it should also be on the hook if the institution fails students,” said Under Secretary of Education James Kvaal. “Today’s steps will ensure taxpayers aren’t held liable for colleges that fail their students or close their doors, especially without the opportunity for students to finish their courses of study.” Under this policy, any organization or entity with at least a 50 percent interest in a non-public college that meets certain other conditions will generally join that institution’s leadership in signing the school’s Program Participation Agreement (PPA). The additional signature will be required in cases where the institution has not met financial responsibility requirements, where the school is provisionally certified to participate in the federal financial aid programs, and for schools with significant liabilities for borrower defense or other findings, among other circumstances. This approach will also apply when a group of related owners together hold at least a 50 percent interest. Private colleges will be required to obtain the additional signature(s) when their PPAs are recertified or when undergoing a change in ownership. ""Too often the Department has seen those who reap the rewards of colleges' actions when things go well leave us holding the bag when things go badly,” said Richard Cordray, head of Federal Student Aid. “We will be vigilant in our oversight and enforcement of this new policy. The additional signature(s) will ensure that sole or controlling entities—and not just their defunct institutions—are held responsible for losses to taxpayers when institutions close. These signatures will help to avoid the substantial losses taxpayers have shouldered when colleges close. College closures have left many students academically stranded, often bearing debt for an education they were unable to complete or that did not live up to the school’s promises. The Biden-Harris Administration is also taking steps to ensure that students are better protected in the event of school closures. Since the start of the Administration, the Department has granted $3.2 billion in closed school and borrower defense discharges to borrowers who attended ITT Technical Institute, Corinthian Colleges, and other institutions. In February 2022, the Department announced the first approved borrower defense claims against an open institution, DeVry University, and it will seek to recoup the costs of the discharges from DeVry. Through these and other actions the Department has approved over $17 billion in targeted loan debt for more than 700,000 borrowers. The Department is also engaged in rulemaking on a variety of issues related to affordability and student loans, including proposals to expand access to closed school discharge and borrower defense, and on institutional and programmatic eligibility. Additionally, the Department reestablished the Office of Enforcement within Federal Student Aid to investigate and take action against institutions that pose widespread risks to students and taxpayers.

During today’s conversation, Secretary Cardona told the leaders: “We have the opportunity to ensure our nation moves closer to realizing its highest ideals as a place where anyone—no matter their background or circumstance—can make of their lives whatever they dream. Faith-based communities are critical partners in our efforts to rebuild and recover from the pandemic. Now is our moment to provide every student with the support and resources they need to thrive, and to ensure that education truly becomes the great equalizer. The task before us is not only to improve our education system from where it was before the pandemic, but also to take bold and unapologetic action to elevate it to lead the world.” The roundtable included leaders who shared reflections about hearing the call to lead their communities during the pandemic and continuing to answer that call by supporting children and communities during recovery. Secretary Cardona credited the faith leaders for bringing hope and healing where needed. Faith leaders discussed the importance of diversity, uplifting student voices and the challenges of mental health for students, educators, and the community. The group also talked about ways to disrupt hate, especially geared towards children, educators, and schools. One leader noted, “We must find the place to be exemplars of diversity and decency.” Several participants also shared insights about the conversation: “The Interfaith Center of New York welcomes Secretary Cardona to New York and commends his outreach to faith leaders of different traditions who share a common commitment to the flourishing of youth and young adults in a post-pandemic world,” said Rev. Dr. Chloe Breyer of the Interfaith Center of New York. “Members of our community have gone through so much over the last two years,” said Pastor Gilford Monrose, faith advisor and executive director of the Office of Faith-Based and Community Partnerships in New York. “We are glad to have the opportunity to speak with the U.S. Secretary of Education about some of the hardships we’ve faced and ways the faith leaders can partner with the Department to ensure a cohesive and successful recovery.” February 2022 marked one year since President Biden signed the Executive Order on the Establishment of the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships. The Department of Education’s Center for Faith-based and Neighborhood Partnerships works alongside the White House office to build partnerships that promote student achievement and equitable outcomes."

Throughout his more than 35 years of experience as a higher education leader, Dr. Paydar has championed equitable and affordable access to postsecondary education. He also has placed an important focus on diversifying the higher education workforce. Dr. Paydar has deep experience on the ground leading institutions of higher education, including serving as vice chancellor and dean of Indiana University–Purdue University Columbus for three years and chancellor of Indiana University East for five years. And for the last 10 years, Dr. Paydar has served at Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis in the roles of executive vice chancellor and chief academic officer as well as the university’s fifth chancellor. I’m confident that Dr. Paydar will advance our efforts at the Department of Education and throughout the Biden-Harris administration to provide students of all ages, backgrounds, and abilities with more inclusive, affordable postsecondary learning opportunities, whether they be college degrees or career and technical programs. I have no doubt Dr. Paydar will be an asset to the Department and hope for his swift confirmation so he can join us in this critical work.” About Nasser Paydar Dr. Nasser H. Paydar is chancellor emeritus of Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) and executive vice president of Indiana University (IU). An IU faculty member for more than 36 years, he has held various administrative and executive leadership positions at the university. Paydar joined IUPUI in 1985 as an assistant professor of mechanical engineering. From 1989 to 2003, he held a number of positions in the school, including chair of the Department of Mechanical Engineering, associate dean for graduate programs, associate dean for academic programs, and executive associate dean.

18-Mar-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/education-department-launches-historic-real-pay-real-jobs-initiative-people-disabilities,Education Department Launches Historic Real Pay for Real Jobs Initiative for People with Disabilities,"Today, the U.S. Department of Education’s Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) released the notice inviting applications for the Subminimum Wage to Competitive Integrated Employment (SWTCIE) demonstration project, aimed at increasing access for people with disabilities to jobs that pay good wages. The SWTCIE project is the largest discretionary grant administered by RSA, with $167 million available to State Vocational Rehabilitation agencies and their partners. “Economic security should be available to all Americans,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “Providing individuals with disabilities with a high-quality education and the services that they need to thrive will result in real pay for real jobs, empowering them and leading to greater social and economic inclusion.” SWTCIE is a step toward ending practices that have allowed some employers to pay less than the federal minimum wage to people with disabilities. The new grant program will sponsor innovative approaches that allow people with disabilities to successfully secure jobs working alongside their non-disabled peers while earning the same pay. “More than 30 years after the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act, far too many people with disabilities continue to be denied equal opportunity,” said U.S. Rep. Robert C. “Bobby” Scott of Virginia, chairman of the House Committee on Education and Labor. “The subminimum wage for workers with disabilities is a relic of a time when people with disabilities were viewed as unable to work and lacked federal protections. It is long past time that we help phase out the subminimum wage for people with disabilities and expand access to fulfilling employment and economic self-sufficiency. We must continue working to ensure every American can succeed and earn a fair wage.” To help eliminate subminimum wage employment, this competition will award grants to as many as 18 State Vocational Rehabilitation agencies and their partners that will create employment opportunities for individuals with disabilities. The jobs will be in critical need areas, including home and community-based services, the arts, or transportation and related industries. In addition, applicants may submit proposals in other areas that will transition individuals from subminimum wage employment to competitive integrated employment. “Some workers with disabilities spend decades earning a subminimum wage without the opportunity to gain new skills or move to a job that pays a higher wage. Today, the Department of Education took an important step to end this discriminatory practice,” said U.S. Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania. “I applaud Secretary Cardona for his leadership and I will keep fighting to ensure all workers with disabilities are paid at least minimum wage and have the opportunity to succeed in the workplace.” The SWTCIE project advances a key Biden-Harris Administration goal – strengthening the economic security of Americans with disabilities. This funding opportunity aligns existing and emerging employment opportunities with the needs of employers and the public infrastructure. Most notably, activities will ensure people with disabilities are earning real pay for real jobs. The Department's Rehabilitation Services Administration web page provides additional information about vocational rehabilitation opportunities for people with disabilities. The Notice Inviting Applications is available for public inspection at the Federal Register . The Federal Register will publish the official version of the notice on Monday, March 21. The deadline for submissions is June 21, 2022."

Levine, M.D., assistant secretary for health at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, held a virtual roundtable with LGBTQI+ students and families from Florida, hosted by the White House Office of Public Engagement. Throughout the roundtable, Secretary Cardona and Admiral Levine affirmed the Biden-Harris Administration’s support for the LGBTQI+ community, shared mental health resources available from the federal government, and heard from students and families about the impact recent anti-LGBTQ legislation has on their communities and school experiences. “The Department and the Biden-Harris Administration stands with LGBTQI+ students and families in Florida and across the country. Laws around the country, including in Florida, have targeted and sought to bully some of our most vulnerable students and families, and create division in our schools,” said Secretary Cardona. “My message to you is that this Administration won’t stand for bullying or discrimination of any kind, and we will use our authorities to protect, support, and provide opportunities for LGBTQI+ students and all students.” “We need to support LGBTQI+ youth, their parents and families to help them achieve the good health and quality care they deserve,” said Admiral Levine. “Our communities have a champion in President Biden. The President supports equality and works to ensure everyone is represented. And that gives people a voice, a chance to effect change, to help people understand the diverse needs of our nation.” One by one, the students and families shared some of the concerns and fears they are facing as the threat of these bills becomes more apparent and resources that local, state, and federal leaders can provide to support the LGBTQI+ community and students across the country. Shortly after the Florida Legislature passed the Parental Rights in Education bill, Secretary Cardona criticized leaders in Florida for prioritizing hateful bills that hurt some of the students most in need.

16-Mar-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-announces-action-support-hbcu-response-bomb-threats,U.S. Department of Education Announces Action to Support HBCU Response to Bomb Threats,"Today, Vice President Kamala Harris and the U.S. Department of Education (Department) announced that Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) that have recently experienced a bomb threat resulting in a disruption to the campus learning environment, are eligible to apply for grant funds under the Project School Emergency Response to Violence (Project SERV) program. Project SERV provides short-term immediate funding for local educational agencies (LEAs) and institutions of higher education (IHEs) that have experienced a violent or traumatic incident to assist in restoring a safe environment conducive to learning. “The recent bomb threats experienced by HBCUs have shaken students and fractured their sense of safety and belonging, which are critical to their academic success and wellbeing,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “We, at the Department of Education, recognize how these threats evoke a painful history of violence against Black Americans in this country that is especially traumatizing to HBCU students, faculty, and staff. Today’s announcement will improve access to Project SERV grants for HBCUs as these institutions work to address students’ mental health needs, shore up campus security, and restore learning environments so that they can get back to doing what they do best—educating the next generation of great leaders.” The Department will work with HBCUs that have received recent bomb threats to determine if Project SERV can help with immediate needs, such as targeted mental health resources or enhanced security to restore the learning environment on their campuses. Funding for Project SERV is limited, and awards typically range from $50,000 to $150,000 per school. ""The bomb threats against HBCUs, particularly concentrated in Black History Month, constitute a uniquely traumatic event, given the history of bombings as a tactic to intimidate and provoke fear in Black Americans during the long struggle for civil rights in the 20th century,” said Dietra Trent, Executive Director of the White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence and Economic Opportunity through Historically Black Colleges and Universities. “In this context, even the threat of bombings at HBCUs can have a deep and unsettling impact on students, faculty, and staff that significantly disrupts the learning environment. Our HBCUs are pillars of strength and resiliency, and we will continue working to promote policies and practices that fortify that strength and advance educational equity, excellence, and economic opportunity through these institutions.” The Biden-Harris Administration is taking a whole-of-government approach to ensuring the safety and well-being of students, staff and faculty, and addressing these repeated threats to HBCU campuses. Following the first reports of the threats, Secretary Cardona and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas hosted a briefing with more than 40 presidents of HBCUs from across the nation to share information about grant programs, training resources, and other tools available to HBCUs to strengthen campus safety and security. Biden-Harris Administration leaders have also recently visited HBCU campuses, hearing firsthand about the need to modernize and update their operations, including campus safety and security, and the need for more resources to help bolster mental health services due to increased apprehension across the campus community. In addition to today’s announcement, the Department will provide HBCUs with a compendium of the resources that are available across the Federal government. These other resources can help with long-term improvements to campus mental health programs, campus safety and emergency management planning and response. An HBCU that experienced a recent bomb threat may receive more information about the opportunity for support under Project SERV by emailing project.serv@ed.gov ."

This includes $17.5 billion for the Title I program as a down payment on President Biden’s commitment to bridge funding and equity gaps in our education system, target resources to schools with a high percentage of students from low-income backgrounds, and improve educational outcomes for students. The bipartisan package makes important strides to meet the needs of the whole child, to support effective teaching and learning, and to strengthen the pipeline for underrepresented teachers. This bipartisan move also helps make college more affordable by increasing the maximum Pell Grant by $400, which is a down payment on the President’s call to double Pell, and will help more students pursue a college education and gain the skills to secure their futures. At the Department of Education, we’ll continue building on the strong foundation set forth through this funding to support the success of all students.”"

We also delivered tens of billions of dollars to begin closing longstanding equity gaps in higher education and help our colleges and universities invest in COVID-19 testing and campus safety, keep tuitions stable, and provide financially struggling students with direct assistance to stay enrolled. Today, the Department is advising state and local leaders on how they can continue leveraging American Rescue Plan funds to establish new summer and afterschool programs; grow and strengthen a talented and diverse educator workforce; and invest in tutors, counselors, and other school staff who can lessen the burden on teachers and help tend to our children's social, emotional, and mental health needs. From kindergarten to high school to college and careers, our North Star remains clear: a robust and equitable recovery that ensures every student is able to succeed and pursue their dreams."" The White House also issued a fact sheet to celebrate the impact ARP funds are having in classrooms. Featuring highlights from across the country, the fact sheet outlines how ARP dollars helped schools safely re-open and are addressing the academic and mental health needs of students.

With today's announcement of updated CDC guidance, we can continue to keep schools safely open while allowing for educators and parents to get back to focusing on what is most important: our students' futures. Moving forward, districts should continue to work with local health experts, parents, and educators to identify what works best for their communities and consider the appropriate mitigation strategies needed to keep students and staff safe. This work – in addition to the critical work of helping students catch up academically and providing emotional and mental health supports– can and should be done using American Rescue Plan funds. As we move forward into a new phase of recovery, the Department remains committed to our school communities and providing the guidance and resources they need to be successful.""

As schools help students address lost instructional time, high-quality CTE programs can be a powerful tool to boost school engagement and on-time graduation. ""As our nation recovers from the pandemic, we must ensure today's students are ready to meet tomorrow's needs. Investments in Career and Technical Education – programs that are proven to successfully reengage students and prepare them for in-demand, good paying jobs – are key to that goal,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""Expanded pathways from high school to the workforce can help students gain the skills and earn the credentials needed for high-growth jobs, including those that don't require a four-year college degree."" The American Rescue Plan Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund (ARP ESSER) has provided nearly $122 billion to states and school districts to invest in K-12 schools and meet the urgent needs of schools and students as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The new fact sheet highlights examples of how states are using relief funds for CTE programs in high schools as part of their work to help students and communities recover and create opportunities for students to pursue higher education and successful careers. Students who complete a sequence of CTE courses in high school are more likely to graduate on time and enroll in postsecondary education. Course sequences can include opportunities to participate in work-based learning and to earn postsecondary credit or industry-recognized credentials in high school. Earlier this year, Secretary Cardona highlighted the importance of making higher education more inclusive and affordable as he laid out his vision and priorities for education in America. He also stressed that students should have pathways through higher education that lead to successful careers. To achieve that, he called for reimagining the connection among p-12, higher education, and the workforce.

24-Feb-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/education-department-announces-35-million-competition-improve-teacher-quality,Education Department Announces $35 Million Competition to Improve Teacher Quality,"Today, the U.S. Department of Education is posting a Notice Inviting Applications for the Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) program , which will award $35 million to bolster teacher preparation programs at the undergraduate or ""fifth-year"" level (Pre-Baccalaureate Models), as well as teaching residency programs for individuals new to teaching that integrate relevant academic content and meaningful clinical experience (Residency Models). ""Across the country, we must continue the necessary work of developing a strong, diverse educator workforce for today and tomorrow,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""High-quality educator preparation programs and teacher residencies are integral to this effort. Effective programs have positive effects on teacher candidates—including boosting the likelihood that they will remain in the profession—and they increase the impact that great teachers have on student learning."" In keeping with Secretary Cardona's priorities , this competition also includes four competitive priorities focused on educator diversity; student social, emotional, and academic needs; and student equitable access to opportunities and resources. Research shows that high-quality residency models like those in the TQP program can expand the pool of well-prepared applicants entering the teaching profession, promote diversity of the workforce, and bring a wide range of experiences into the classroom to support students. In addition, the close partnership between school districts and colleges required by the TQP program ensures that preparation programs are closely aligned with practice. The Biden-Harris Administration believes that support for high-quality residency programs is a critical part of ensuring that all students have access to well-prepared and qualified educators, as these programs produce teachers who are more effective and likely to stay in the profession than less comprehensive pathways. Applicants are also encouraged to apply for partnership grants for the establishment of Grow Your Own (GYO) Programs. The Biden-Harris Administration has called for more investment in high-quality teacher preparation, including GYO programs, to strengthen teacher pipelines and address shortages, and increase and support the growth of teachers. As with teaching residency programs, GYO programs can help address teacher shortages by increasing retention rates while also enhancing educator diversity. Additionally, the Leadership Program priority in the TQP program provides an opportunity for applicants to carry out an effective school leadership program that will prepare individuals for careers as superintendents, principals, early childhood education program directors, or other school leaders. The Department recognizes the value of supporting educators and is committed to the providing resources and opportunities that lift up the educator workforce.

23-Feb-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/wyomings-keeley-anderson-named-2022-recognizing-inspiring-school-employees-awardee,Wyoming’s Keeley Anderson Named 2022 'Recognizing Inspiring School Employees' Awardee,"U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona announced today the selection of Keeley Anderson, an intervention specialist at Newcastle Middle School in Newcastle, Wyoming, as the national 2022 Recognizing Inspiring School Employees ( RISE )awardee. Secretary Cardona notified her of the national recognition through surprise Zoom participation during an all-school assembly. This honor, established by Congress in 2019, spotlights education support professionals’ outstanding contributions to quality K-12 education in the United States. Officially called “classified school employees,” staff eligible for this recognition include paraprofessionals, clerical and administrative services, transportation services, food and nutrition services, custodial and maintenance services, security services, health and student services, technical services, and skilled trades professionals. They offer essential services to the school community and play a vital role in providing for the welfare, safety, and success of students. “I’m pleased to recognize Ms. Keeley Anderson as the 2022 Recognizing Inspiring School Employees Awardee for her work to enhance the lives and learning of students in her community,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “Education support professionals deserve appreciation today and every day. Especially amid the pandemic, their contributions to school communities have been extraordinary and have helped schools remain open for in-person learning. It's an honor for me to present Kelley with this well-deserved award.” “It is an honor to be able to recognize someone who is so dedicated to her school community,” said Gov. Mark Gordon. “Keeley’s tireless commitment to encourage students and her willingness to take on additional duties reflects the excellence of Wyoming’s school employees, whose actions have lasting positive impacts on students' lives.” “Keeley is a true inspiration, and I congratulate her for her commitment to the students in Newcastle, Wyoming,” said Brian Schroeder, State Superintendent of Public Instruction. “That she is able to connect with students in such a distinct and supportive way just goes to show why she has been nominated – and been awarded – this honor. She allows her students to succeed, and that in itself is a true testament of her character.” “Over the time I have been an educator, I have always been blessed with great team members,” said Weston County School District Superintendent Brad LaCroix. “Today we celebrate one of our incredibly talented teammates with a very well-deserved recognition.” “Keeley has a unique ability to connect with students and get them to see that she is on 'their side,'” said Newcastle Middle School Principal Tyler Barlett, who nominated Anderson for the award. “She helps instill qualities like integrity and character while empowering students to advocate for themselves and learn how to solve their own problems. Ironically, it is when her students no longer need her that we know she has succeeded.” As an intervention specialist, Anderson prioritizes students who need additional support to be successful. She leads Newcastle Middle School’s in-school-suspension program and the school’s late academic start Wednesday programming. She pitches in as part of the district’s summer maintenance department and served as the head volleyball coach at Newcastle High School. Anderson became more indispensable to her community during the pandemic. During this time, in addition to all her usual duties, she became the key communicator and liaison for students who were placed in quarantine by public health orders, helping them to manage their work remotely and then to transition back to school. Events leading to Anderson’s selection began in April 2019 when Congress passed the Recognizing Achievement in Classified School Employees Act (Public Law 116-13), which states, “Prior to May 31 of each year… the Secretary shall select a classified school employee to receive the Recognizing Inspiring School Employees Award for the year.” For this second competition, the Education Department received 25 nominations from 15 states encompassing paraprofessional, clerical and administrative services, transportation services, food and nutrition services, custodial and maintenance services, security services, health and student services, technical services, and skilled trades professionals. Governors’ offices determined their state-specific process for selecting up to two nominees, and they will again be asked to submit nominees by Nov. 1, documenting excellence in the following areas: a) Work performance; b) School and community involvement; c) Leadership and commitment; d) Local support (from co-workers, school administrators, community members, etc., who speak to the nominee’s exemplary work); and e) Enhancement of classified school employees' image in the community and schools. More information can be found here , including how to submit nominations for the 2022-2023 cycle."
16-Feb-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/education-department-approves-415-million-borrower-defense-claims-including-former-devry-university-students,Education Department Approves $415 Million in Borrower Defense Claims Including for Former DeVry University Students,"Nearly 16,000 borrowers will receive $415 million in borrower defense to repayment discharges following the approval of four new findings and the continued review of claims. This includes approximately 1,800 former DeVry University (DeVry) students who will receive approximately $71.7 million in full borrower defense discharges after the U.S. Department of Education (Department) determined that the institution made widespread substantial misrepresentations about its job placement rates. These are the first approved borrower defense claims associated with a currently operating institution, and the Department will seek to recoup the cost of the discharges from DeVry. The Department anticipates that the number of approved claims related to DeVry will increase as it continues reviewing pending applications. In addition to the DeVry findings, the Department is announcing several other actions that will provide an additional approximately $343.7 million in borrower defense discharges to almost 14,000 borrowers. This includes new findings related to Westwood College and the nursing program at ITT Technical Institute, as well as recent findings about the criminal justice programs at Minnesota School of Business/Globe University and another $284.5 million in discharges to over 11,900 students who attended institutions such as Corinthian Colleges and Marinello Schools of Beauty whose applications were reviewed after earlier announcements of relief. “The Department remains committed to giving borrowers discharges when the evidence shows their college violated the law and standards,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “Students count on their colleges to be truthful. Unfortunately, today’s findings show too many instances in which students were misled into loans at institutions or programs that could not deliver what they’d promised.” Today’s actions bring the total amount of approved relief under borrower defense to repayment to approximately $2 billion for more than 107,000 borrowers. “When colleges and career schools put their own interests ahead of students, we will not look the other way,” said Federal Student Aid Chief Operating Officer Richard Cordray. “We are grateful to have strong enforcement and oversight partners, such as the Federal Trade Commission and attorneys general in Colorado, Illinois, and New Mexico. These offices provided key evidence that played a significant role in reaching the findings announced today. Moving forward, we intend to expand our collaboration with federal and state partners to serve students.” DeVry University After a review of voluminous amounts of evidence, the Department found that from 2008 to 2015 DeVry repeatedly misled prospective students across the country with claims that 90 percent of DeVry graduates who actively seek employment obtained jobs in their field of study within six months of graduation. This claim was the foundation of a national advertising campaign called, “We Major in Careers” to brand DeVry as a “Career Placement University” where it used the 90 percent placement statistic as the way to convince prospective students to enroll. In fact, the institution’s actual job placement rate was around 58 percent. The Department found that more than half of the jobs included in the claimed 90 percent placement rate were held by students who obtained them well before graduating from DeVry and often before they even enrolled. These jobs were not attributable to a DeVry education and their inclusion was contrary to the plain language of the 90 percent claim. Moreover, DeVry excluded from its calculation large numbers of graduates who were in fact actively looking for work simply because they did not conduct a search in the manner that the University’s Career Services department preferred. The Department also found that senior DeVry officials knew of the problems with the 90 percent statistic for years, in part due to concerns about its accuracy raised by alumni. In 2016, the FTC reached a $100 million settlement with DeVry around similar allegations. The Department also reached a settlement with DeVry related to older job placement rate statistics in 2015. The attorneys general of New York and Massachusetts also reached agreements with DeVry in 2017 to resolve allegations of misleading job placement rates. To date, the Department has identified approximately 1,800 borrowers who will be eligible for approximately $71.7 million in discharges because they relied upon DeVry’s misrepresentation in deciding to enroll. The number of approvals is anticipated to grow as the Department reviews outstanding claims from former DeVry students. All borrowers with approved claims will receive full relief. During this period of misrepresentation, DeVry was a publicly traded company owned by DeVry Education Group Inc., which was later renamed Adtalem Global Education. Senior leaders at DeVry during this time included Daniel Hamburger, who served as President and CEO from 2002 through 2016 and David Pauldine, who served as the executive vice president and/or president of DeVry University from 2005 through 2014. Adtalem sold DeVry in 2018. Westwood College Employment Prospects The Department has also found that from 2002 through its closure in 2015, Westwood College (Westwood) made widespread and substantial misrepresentations to students about their salary potential and likelihood of finding a job after graduating. Westwood made an “employment pledge” to students that they would find a job within six months of graduating or get help paying their bills, and admissions representatives made similar guarantees of employment. Westwood also claimed graduates would make salaries of $50,000 or more and had placement rates of 80 percent or higher. The Department has no evidence Westwood made good on its pledge. In fact, its job placement rates were grossly inflated, and its salary promises were based upon national federal data while actual Westwood graduates often made half or as little as one-fourth of those amounts. The Department will approve full discharges of approximately $53.1 million for approximately 1,600 borrowers who submitted claims covered by these findings. The Department is also in the process of identifying cases that were previously denied but could be reopened and approved based upon this additional evidence. This is the third finding against Westwood. In July 2021, the Department found that Westwood had also made widespread and substantial misrepresentations about the ability of students to transfer credits and that students in its criminal justice program in Illinois would be able to find jobs as police officers. Combined, the Department has now approved approximately 4,100 claims and approximately $130 million in discharges for students who attended Westwood. Westwood College was owned by Alta College, Inc. (Alta), which was located in Colorado. In 2002, Alta was acquired by Housatonic Partners, a private equity firm located in California and Massachusetts. Major executives at Alta included co-founder Kirk Riedinger and George Burnett. ITT Nursing The Department also found that, from July 2007 through its 2016 closure, ITT Technical Institute (ITT) misled prospective students about the programmatic accreditation of its associate degree in nursing program. ITT falsely told students that its nursing program had or would shortly obtain necessary programmatic accreditation that played a significant role in a student’s ability to get a nursing job. However, the school repeatedly failed to obtain programmatic accreditation for years as the accreditors found that ITT failed to meet standards for job placement and licensure pass rates, had insufficient physical and fiscal resources, and unqualified faculty. As a result, the Department will approve full discharges of approximately $3.1 million for approximately 130 students. This is the fourth finding against ITT Technical Institute following findings in 2021 that the school lied about employment prospects and the ability to transfer credits and a 2017 finding that ITT made false claims of guaranteed employment to California students. Combined, these findings have resulted in approximately $660 million in discharges for approximately 23,000 students. ITT was a publicly traded company during this time. Its senior leadership included Kevin Modany, who served as CEO and President of ITT until 2014 and Eugene Feichtner who served as President and CEO from August 2014 until 2016. Minnesota School of Business/Globe University The Department recently determined that borrowers who attended the criminal justice programs at the Minnesota School of Business (MSB) and/or Globe University (Globe) are entitled to full borrower defense discharges. The Minnesota Office of the Attorney General sued the schools, and, in September 2016, a Minnesota judge found that the schools committed fraud in telling students that the criminal justice programs at those schools would allow them to become a Minnesota police officer or parole/probation officer. However, those programs lacked the necessary accreditation and certifications making it impossible for graduates of those programs to obtain those positions with the state. As a result, the Department approved approximately $3 million in discharges for 270 students. The Department previously announced in January that it had approved discharges for 921 other students who have more than $23 million in outstanding loan balances. The Department has received $7 million as part of a 2021 bankruptcy settlement with the schools to help offset the cost of these discharges. Globe and MSB were owned by the Myhre family. Terry Myhre owned 50 percent of Globe and 80 percent of MSB. Jeff Myhre served as Chief Executive Officer, Terry Myhre served as President, and Kaye Myhre served as Vice President. Additional Approvals Once the Department reaches findings against an institution, it will continue to approve any applications it subsequently receives from borrowers who attended during the period of demonstrated misconduct and that raise allegations that are supported by the evidence we have reviewed. As part of those ongoing reviews, the Department has already identified another approximately $284.5 million in discharges for over 11,900 students who attended institutions such as Corinthian Colleges, where the Department previously issued findings. Continued Commitment to Targeted Relief Including today’s actions, the Department has now approved approximately $16 billion in loan discharges for more than 680,000 borrowers. This includes: Almost $5 billion for 70,000 borrowers through improvements to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. $7.8 billion for more than 400,000 borrowers who have a total and permanent disability. $1.2 billion for borrowers who previously attended ITT Technical Institutes before it closed. The Department is also working on new regulations that will improve borrower defense and other discharge programs and provide greater protections for students and taxpayers. This includes writing a new borrower defense regulation, proposing to re-establish a gainful employment regulation to hold career training programs accountable for unaffordable debt, and proposing to create financial triggers so that the Department has monetary protection against potential losses, including borrower defense liabilities."
15-Feb-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-invites-applicants-javits-gifted-and-talented-program,U.S. Department of Education Invites Applicants for Javits Gifted and Talented Program,"Today, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) released the FY 2022 notice inviting applications (NIA) for the Jacob K. Javits Gifted and Talented Students Education Program (Javits) . The program will award up to $6.6 million in new grants for five-year projects that support evidence-based research, demonstration projects, innovative strategies, and similar activities that enhance elementary and secondary schools' capacity to identify gifted and talented students and meet their unique educational needs. Supporting all students, including gifted and talented students, with accelerated learning opportunities is critical to addressing the impacts of lost instructional time and supporting positive academic outcomes for all children. Accelerated learning opportunities can help to ensure students excel and thrive. ""Expanding access to gifted and talented programs is one important way that we can ensure all students—particularly those who are underserved—have the opportunity to engage in rich, rigorous learning experiences that open doors for them to discover new passions and reach their potential,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""This work is perhaps more important now than ever before, when we must support students through our nation's continued recovery from the pandemic and boldly address opportunity gaps in our education system."" The Department strives to ensure that the educational needs of underserved children and youth, including those with disabilities who are gifted and talented, are met. Addressing and closing educational opportunity gaps in underserved communities—before and after the pandemic—are one of the top priorities of the Biden-Harris Administration. A major emphasis of the Javits program is to identify and serve students underrepresented in gifted and talented programs, to include the training of personnel in the identification and education of gifted and talented students and in the use, where appropriate, of gifted and talented services, materials, and methods, for all students. The FY 2022 Javits program competition focuses on students who are underserved and underrepresented in gifted and talented programs by including an absolute priority that applicants must address to be eligible for review. This year's application requires applicants to develop ""new information that assists schools in the identification of, and provision of services to, gifted and talented students (including economically disadvantaged individuals, individuals who are multilingual learners, and children with disabilities) who may not be identified and served through traditional assessment methods."" Eligible applicants include state educational agencies; local educational agencies, the Bureau of Indian Education; institutions of higher education; other public agencies; or other private agencies or organizations. Applications are due on April 4, 2022. Successful applicants will be selected through a competitive peer review process, and awards will be made by August 2022. A pre-application webinar will be held for potential applicants on Feb. 24, 2022, from 1 – 4 p.m. ET, via MS Teams. Information about the pre-application meeting will be posted here ."
7-Feb-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/new-updates-college-scorecard-make-tool-more-useful-students-and-families-data-about-college-costs-graduation-rates-and-post-college-earnings,"New Updates to College Scorecard Make Tool More Useful for Students and Families With Data About College Costs, Graduation Rates, and Post-College Earnings","Today, the U.S. Department of Education released updates to the College Scorecard that make the tool more useful for students and families weighing college options. The tool also includes new and updated information that may be beneficial to school counselors, college access providers, researchers, and other critical stakeholders. The Department has improved the College Scorecard interactive web tool, in addition to restoring several metrics that help students gauge how their prospective institution compares to other colleges across costs, graduation rates, post-college earnings, and other metrics. The changes reflect the Department's priority of supporting and encouraging inclusive, affordable postsecondary programs that provide strong career outcomes for students. U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona will highlight these new updates to the College Scorecard today, during the 2022 Community College National Legislative Summit, an event that brings together hundreds of community college leaders from across the country. ""For so many students and families, the college search process can be overwhelming. But easily accessible, high-quality information about higher education institutions can help students determine which college or university is the best fit for them,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""The updated and enhanced College Scorecard shines a spotlight on affordability, inclusivity, and outcomes, over exclusivity and colleges that leave students without good jobs and with mountains of debt. This update reflects the Biden-Harris administration's commitment to ensuring students remain at the heart of the Department's work."" Updates to the College Scorecard also include an annual refresh of the cumulative loan debt of student borrowers at both the institution-level and by field of study within each institution, as well as federal student loan repayment rates for the institution. For the first time since 2018, the Department is publishing—both in the data files and on the consumer site—institution-level earnings data, which provide an overall sense of the career outcomes for alumni of the institution. The Scorecard also includes additional information about graduates who are better off for having gone to the college, by showing the percentage of those earning more than the typical worker with only a high school diploma. College Scorecard data provide essential details for students and prospective students across all colleges, helping them to make informed decisions about their postsecondary education plans. The data also shine a spotlight on accessible colleges that are serving their students well, including by closing gaps in the completion rates among students of color compared with white students and by ensuring programs lead to positive career outcomes with manageable levels of debt. Examples include: University of Baltimore, a Predominantly Black Institution in Maryland, enrolls Black students as nearly half of its enrollment, charges much lower tuition than most four-year institutions, and saw median post-college earnings of more than $58,000. Valencia College, a community college in Florida, enrolls three in four of its undergraduate population as students of color and has narrowed its college completion rate gaps; today, 45% of white students and 41% of Hispanic students graduate from the program. The College Scorecard includes many other examples of institutions that are inclusive, often under-resourced, and are working to improve their students' outcomes. The College Scorecard builds on efforts by the Biden-Harris Administration to address barriers to college completion, particularly for students from low-income backgrounds and students of color, and increase accountability for institutions of higher education. Secretary Cardona discussed these efforts as part of his vision for education from early childhood education through higher education and career pathways, which he laid out earlier this year. These efforts include: Launching the Institutional and Programmatic Eligibility negotiated rulemaking committee to develop strong rules to ensure career training programs lead to valuable credentials for their graduates; Establishing an Office of Enforcement within the office of Federal Student Aid to identify and address major problems across institutions that pose widespread risks to students and taxpayers; Providing billions in federal COVID relief funding for institutions that serve high populations of students of color and students from low-income backgrounds; Cancelling more than $15 billion in student loan debt for 675,000 borrowers across the country; and Proposing expanded access through more funding for Pell Grants for students."

28-Jan-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-national-comprehensive-center-release-latest-tool-support-effective-use-american-rescue-plan-funds,"U.S Department of Education, National Comprehensive Center Release Latest Tool to Support Effective Use of American Rescue Plan Funds","Today, the U.S. Department of Education and its technical assistance partner the National Comprehensive Center released a new resource to help states share their progress deploying the $122 billion American Rescue Plan Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ARP ESSER) funds. These funds support safe in-person instruction, address the effects of lost instructional time due to COVID-19, and meet the social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs of students. The ARP Partnership, Assistance, Transformation, and Heightened Support (ARP PATHS) tool invites states to describe the strategies they are implementing that could serve as promising practices for other states and the nation in ensuring that ARP ESSER funds are used appropriately and effectively as intended by the law. ""Through ARP PATHS, states and districts will be able to more effectively and transparently communicate their efforts and share promising practices so that, across the country, we can do more of what works to ensure that our students, schools, and educators thrive,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ARP PATHS includes a number of considerations for states as they build capacity and communicate their work to districts and the public. The tool includes six sections that are based on the ARP ESSER state plan application that all states have submitted, and the Department has approved. For each section, states can indicate the implementation status, describe their states' progress, and outline promising practices or impact. These include topics such as implementing strategies to support safe in-person instruction, incorporating ongoing engagement with parents and other stakeholders, addressing learning loss, meeting urgent staffing needs, and ensuring transparency. ""Since the start of the pandemic, Democrats have worked to put our kids first—that's why we passed the American Rescue Plan to provide the schools the resources they need to stay open safely, provide mental health resources, and address learning loss to get our kids back on track after an incredibly tough two years,"" said Sen. Patty Murray, chair of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP). ""And as the Omicron surge continues, schools continue facing huge challenges—from buying masks to dealing with staff shortages—and it's key they use these resources quickly and carefully to meet their communities' urgent needs. I'm monitoring closely to make sure that happens, so I'm glad this new tool will boost transparency and help schools across the country share their progress and keep kids in school safely."" ""In response to biggest economic and health crisis our country has ever faced, President Biden and Congressional Democrats took decisive action through the American Rescue Plan to provide essential resources for K-12 schools to safely reopen and address the pandemic's impact on students' academic, mental health, social, and emotional needs,"" said Rep. Rosa Delauro, chair of the House Appropriations Committee. ""I applaud the courageous, essential efforts by educators, school leaders, and district leaders to use these flexible ARP funds to address these urgent challenges."" ""States and districts are making historic investments in educational systems using the ARP stimulus funds,"" said Allison Crean Davis, director of the National Comprehensive Center. ""The National Comprehensive Center, in our role partnering with educational leaders and organizations throughout the nation, is looking forward to working with the Department to build upon the ARP PATHS tool with associated resources and supports to help states understand how these investments are improving outcomes for school systems and our nation's students."" The Department is working with states to ensure proper and prompt allocation of federal dollars. As part of the American Rescue Plan Act, the Department required state and local education agencies to create plans for how they would spend their ARP ESSER funds. All states received the initial two-thirds of their allocations in March of last year. To ensure proper stakeholder engagement and planning, states received the remaining one-third of ARP ESSER funds after an individual state plan was approved. As of December 2021, all 50 states the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico received approval of their state plans and their full awards. Links to state and local education agency plans are available here . American Rescue Plan dollars are already being used across the country to address immediate needs, such as staff shortages, and supporting students' mental health, as well as long-term goals like hiring school counselors. The ARP PATHS tool will help elevate and track those efforts. Examples of ARP's impact include: The Vermont Agency of Education (AOE) is partnering with other statewide agencies to vaccinate all Vermonters, including eligible students. AOE will use $1 million in ARP ESSER funds to support a Vaccine Incentive Program that will make awards to schools that achieve a student vaccination rate of 85% or higher. Vermont has achieved a high rate of vaccination for eligible student populations by targeting vaccine clinics to school sites, a sustained interagency public information campaign, and through the leadership and support of school administrators and staff. As of Jan. 14, 75% of Vermont residents aged 12-17 had received at least one dose of vaccine. To build on this success, beginning in 2022, additional funds through the Vaccine Incentive Program will further encourage vaccination for all Vermont students. Wake County Schools in North Carolina provided $3,750 in bonuses for full-time employees to support keeping schools open. Gaston County Schools in North Carolina was able to secure a nurse for all of their 54 school locations. In past years, nurses split their time between two buildings. White Plains City Schools are using their ARP to invest in HVAC units, support the mental health of their teachers, and make sure student learning is not disrupted. Tennessee is using ARP ESSER funds to provide access to intensive, low-ratio tutoring over the next three years. When the program is fully operational, as many as 240,000 students will have access to 300-500 additional hours of targeted support through tutoring to address the lost instructional time from the pandemic. Using American Rescue Plan funds, Arkansas created the Arkansas Tutoring Corps, which includes recruitment, preparation, and support for candidates to become qualified tutors to provide instruction or intervention to meet the academic needs of at-risk learners or students most impacted by lost instructional time. The Arkansas Tutoring Corps project will enhance learning experiences of students impacted by lost instructional time as a result of the pandemic and address gaps in foundational skills in mathematics and literacy. Kearsarge Regional School District in New Hampshire is using ARP funds to install air conditioning in their middle school which will allow them to increase summer programing. Dayton, Ohio is using ARP ESSER funds to hire two times as many teachers in classrooms for grades 1-3 and pursue other interventions such as math specialists for grades 4-6 to help students catch up more quickly. ARP PATHS is part of the Department's overall strategy to support the successful implementation of federal pandemic recovery funds, including ongoing technical assistance; communications; guidance; reporting; formal monitoring, including targeted, comprehensive, and consolidated monitoring protocols; and outreach to parents, educators, and other stakeholders. The Department conducts ongoing monitoring of states, and states are required to approve ARP ESSER spending plans and monitor the use of funds of their school districts.

27-Jan-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/secretary-cardona-lays-out-vision-education-america,Secretary Cardona Lays Out Vision for Education in America,"In a major address at the Department of Education, U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona laid out his vision for continued recovery through the pandemic and his priorities for broader investments in America's education system to ensure all students can succeed and thrive. During the address, Secretary Cardona discussed key strategies the Department, schools, and colleges and universities must take to help students, educators, and school communities – from preschool through postsecondary education – continue to recover from the pandemic and address inequities that have long existed in our education system. ""Reopening schools—and keeping them open—while critical, is insufficient. Our hardest and most important work lies ahead,"" said Secretary Cardona in the address. ""Our students' success is at stake. Not just the students we serve today, but for those who have yet to be born. Our task is not only to improve our education system from where it was before the pandemic, but also to take bolder action to elevate it to lead the world."" During his remarks, Secretary Cardona underscored the work the Biden-Harris Administration has done to help nearly all schools reopen for in-person learning over the last year. When President Biden assumed office, just 46% of America's schools were open full-time in person. Today, 96% are open. Because of the American Rescue Plan, guidance from the Department of Education and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, expanded access to tests and testing resources, and the hard work of educators, families, district leaders, and school communities, America's students have returned to classrooms across the country. And while the Department continues to focus on keeping schools open, it is also focused on strategies to help students make up for lost instructional time, access the mental health supports they need, invest in our educators, and make improvements in our education system to address inequities that existed long before the pandemic. Secretary Cardona laid out how the American Rescue Plan is supporting these efforts now, and how additional investments in our education system can make even greater improvements in our schools and communities. The Secretary also discussed strategies to improve America's postsecondary education system, including creating stronger through-lines between P12 and higher education systems, making postsecondary education more affordable, and putting students and families first in all the Department of Education's work. Secretary Cardona laid out key actions in four priority areas that will guide the Department's work over the coming months and years: Support students through pandemic response and recovery. Engaging families as core partners to educators Addressing missed instruction through intensive tutoring, extended learning time, and other evidence-based practices Increasing access to social, emotional, and mental health supports for all students Encouraging every student to participate in at least one extracurricular activity Boldly address opportunity and achievement gaps. Increasing funding for Title I schools and for IDEA in order to close gaps in access to educational opportunity Providing every family the opportunity to start on a level playing field through free, universal pre-K and affordable high-quality child care Investing in, recruiting, and supporting the professional development of a diverse educator workforce, including special education teachers, paraprofessionals, and bilingual educators so education jobs are ones that people from all backgrounds want to pursue Challenging states and districts to fix broken systems that may perpetuate inequities in our schools Make higher education more inclusive and affordable. Providing targeted loan relief to student borrowers Holding colleges and universities accountable for taking advantage of borrowers Ensuring borrowers have loan payment options that reflect their economic circumstances Making long term improvements to programs like Public Service Loan Forgiveness and creating a strong Gainful Employment Rule so career programs aren't leaving students with mountains of debt and without good job opportunities Ensure pathways through higher education lead to successful careers. Reimagining the connection between p-12, higher education, and workforce Collaborating with the Department of Labor and Department of Commerce to invest in career preparation programs that meet the needs of today's economy Prioritizing grant programs that allow students to return to higher education or pursue career and technical education programs at any point in their lives and careers Investing in colleges and universities that serve underrepresented groups and increase access to and funding for programs like Pell Grants To view a transcript of Secretary Cardona's remarks, visit https://www.ed.gov/news/speeches/priorities-speech"
26-Jan-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-solicits-public-comments-project-prevent-grant-program,U.S. Department of Education Solicits Public Comments on the Project Prevent Grant Program,"As part of the Biden-Harris Administration's efforts to prevent and reduce gun crime and other forms of community violence, today the U.S. Department of Education released the Notice of Proposed Priorities, definition, and requirements for its Project Prevent discretionary grant program and launched the 30-day public comment period. The proposed priorities emphasize the importance and efficacy of a coordinated effort between schools and community-based organizations (e.g., local civic or community-service organizations, local faith-based organizations, or local foundations or non-profit organizations) to help prevent and reduce gun crime and other forms of community violence and mitigate the short- and long-term effects this violence has on students. The notice is intended to encourage effective implementation of community- and school-based strategies through proposed priorities that: Support local educational agencies (LEAs) in offering mental health services to students impacted by community violence; Support LEAs in the implementation of conflict management programs; and Support LEAs in implementing other community- and school-based strategies to help their students break cycles of generational violence and to mitigate the impacts of exposure to community violence. ""Supporting the healthy growth and development of our children, youth, and families takes the effort of whole communities working together. And when we leverage resources in both communities and in schools, students and families have the opportunity to receive a fuller spectrum of supports that can help them on a path to thriving lives,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""At the core of the Project Prevent program is a recognition that when our children, youth, and families succeed, our communities and our country succeed."" The President's FY22 budget calls for $10 million in new funding for the Project Prevent grant program to support community violence intervention strategies, complementing the Biden-Harris Administration's call for a historic $5 billion investment in community violence interventions. This $10 million Project Prevent grant request would expand the capacity of LEAs to implement community- and school-based strategies to help prevent gun crime and other community violence, and to mitigate the impacts of exposure to violence. Children and youth's exposure to community violence, whether as victims or witnesses, has long-term physical and emotional harms which can negatively impact educational and life outcomes. Programs facilitated in schools by counselors, mental health providers, and community leaders for students who have been exposed to or are at high risk of involvement in community violence have been shown to help students develop the social and emotional resiliency and skills to break cycles of generational violence and trauma. When properly implemented and consistently funded and coordinated with agencies, such as public health or public safety agencies where appropriate, the use of community-based strategies can identify those at the highest risk, coordinate individualized support and resources, support victims by providing pathways to healing and stability, and monitor and support long-term success for children and youth in their communities. The notice will be published in the Federal Register on Jan. 28, 2022 and will include information and directions to submit comments about these priorities, the definition, and requirement.

24-Jan-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/readout-secretaries-cardona-and-mayorkass-meeting-hbcu-presidents-international-day-education,Readout of Secretaries Cardona and Mayorkas's Meeting with HBCU Presidents on International Day of Education,"WASHINGTON – Today, on International Day of Education, Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona and Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas hosted a discussion with presidents of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) from across the nation to share information on grant programs, training resources, research opportunities, and other tools available to HBCUs to strengthen campus safety and security. The meeting was part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s ongoing commitment to ensure HBCUs have equitable access to the resources and support they need to effectively execute their critical missions. “To do their best learning, students must be able to focus on their education without fear or distraction. Acts of intimidation against HBCUs can’t and won’t be tolerated,” said Secretary Cardona . “I am pleased Secretary Mayorkas and his team at the Department of Homeland Security are focused on partnerships with HBCU leaders to equip them with the tools to protect their campuses, students, and communities.” “The Department of Homeland Security is eager to deepen our partnerships with HBCUs to protect students and faculty from an evolving range of threats, and to cultivate the next generation of remarkable talent, including by increasing access to careers in the federal government,” said Secretary Mayorkas . “I appreciated the opportunity to speak directly with more than 40 HBCU presidents who lead these tremendous institutions. Together, we will embrace the opportunities and address the challenges of our time.” During today’s meeting, the Department of Homeland Security also provided a briefing on the evolving threat landscape, including potential impacts on colleges and universities. The Department of Homeland Security does not have information indicating any specific, credible threats to campus safety. Leaders from DHS’s Office of Strategy, Policy and Plans, the Office of Intelligence & Analysis, and the Office of Partnerships & Engagement, and the Department of Education’s Office of the Secretary participated in today’s engagement."
21-Jan-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-departments-homeland-security-and-education-release-toolkit-federal-resources-help-rebuild-puerto-ricos-school-infrastructure,U.S. Departments of Homeland Security and Education Release Toolkit of Federal Resources to Help Rebuild Puerto Rico’s School Infrastructure,"Today, the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and the U.S. Department of Education released a toolkit outlining federal resources available to help Puerto Rico recover and rebuild safe, healthy, and modernized school facilities. The Departments of Energy and Labor, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency, also collaborated on the toolkit. The toolkit focuses on four key aspects to supplement ongoing recovery efforts in the education sector: planning and design, workforce readiness, contracting and procurement, and project review. In addition, the document includes a directory with technical assistance opportunities and information on other funding sources from federal partners. “As Puerto Rico continues to rebuild, recover, and reimagine a future of security and prosperity for all of its families, DHS will be there every step of the way,” said Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas. “I encourage officials to use the resources available to them through the federal government to build safe and resilient schools for teachers and students.” “All children deserve to have the opportunity to learn and thrive in safe and functioning educational facilities,” said FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell. “FEMA is proud to continue supporting Puerto Rico through this important phase of work.” “The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to supporting a full recovery in Puerto Rico grounded in dignity, equity, and respect,” said Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “Education is a critical component of full recovery, and access to first-class facilities is a first step in providing all students in Puerto Rico—the island of my roots—with the high-quality education they deserve.” This toolkit was generated by the White House Working Group on Puerto Rico , which was launched in July 2021 to provide Puerto Rico the resources and technical assistance it needs to recover and prosper. After multiple natural disasters, Puerto Rico has access to extensive recovery resources, including more than $2 billion in FEMA Public Assistance for school infrastructure related to recovery. Additionally, billions more in federal education and COVID-19 relief funds are available to assist with addressing and recovering from COVID-19. These funds may also include upgrades to school infrastructure, depending on the program. To date, FEMA has obligated over $25.9 billion towards response and recovery efforts in Puerto Rico. FEMA is helping rebuild large parts of the island and supporting the government of Puerto Rico’s plan to restore critical services systems and build capacity in a manner that is both fiscally sound and resilient against the impacts of future disasters. On Jan. 27, 2022, at 3pm ET/4pm AT, the White House will host a webinar where agencies will discuss the toolkit and resources it identifies. The webinar will be held on Zoom and requires advance registration .

Today, one year since the start of the Biden-Harris Administration, nearly all students are back in school and learning in person with caring teachers and alongside their peers. Across the country, schools are putting in place new programs and supports to address the impact of the pandemic on students’ learning and mental health. To achieve this goal, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) distributed unprecedented resources to states, districts, and K-12 schools, including funding, guidance, and technical assistance to help educators meet the needs of all students, especially those disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. The Department also distributed unprecedented resources to colleges and universities to help ensure students could access a high-quality education as well as the social, emotional, and mental health supports needed to earn their degrees and thrive. The Department also canceled $15 billion in loan debt for hundreds of thousands of students and borrowers, took action to advance equity in education, and made critical progress in creating educational environments free from discrimination or harm. The Department’s key 2021 accomplishments include: Helped reopen over 95% of America’s public schools for in-person learning full-time – up from 46% at the beginning of the Biden Administration. Due to historic investments in K-12 schools through the American Rescue Plan and using the full force of the Administration to get educators, staff, and students vaccinated throughout the year, 95% of public school elementary and middle schools were open, in-person full-time in early January 2022, compared to just 46% in January 2021. On top of these unprecedented investments, the Biden-Harris Administration made available $10 billion in American Rescue Plan funds specifically for states and districts to implement testing programs starting in March 2021. Earlier this month, the Administration also announced it is increasing the number of COVID-19 tests available for schools by 10 million per month to help schools safely remain open and implement screening testing and test-to-stay programs. Invested $122 billion in American Rescue Plan funds to help K-12 schools safely reopen, stay open, and address lost instructional time and students’ needs. The Department distributed unprecedented funding from the American Rescue Plan to help schools reopen safely and support students. As part of this work, the Department also developed guidance to help schools use these funds for their most pressing needs, including addressing students’ mental health, learning needs, and addressing staffing shortages that are impacting schools. Schools across the country, from Vermont to Hawaii, are hosting vaccination clinics. Many districts, like DeKalb County, Georgia, have improved ventilation. Washington Local Schools, in Ohio, hosted its first summer camp, for students in grades K-3, which included a focus on academics. Arkansas created the Arkansas Teaching Corps. New York City is hiring hundreds of school social workers. And Gaston County Schools, in North Carolina, used ARP ESSER funds to double nursing staff and secure a nurse for each of their 54 school locations, so that nurses no longer have to split their time between two buildings. Invested $40 billion in American Rescue Plan funds to over 5,000 institutions of higher education. The Department distributed emergency grants to over 5,000 colleges and universities to provide emergency financial aid to millions of students and ensure learning continued during the pandemic. Half of the funding awarded went directly to students in the form of financial aid to help them remain enrolled during the pandemic. As part of the American Rescue Plan, the Department also released over $3 billion in funding to Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribally Controlled Colleges and Universities, and Minority Serving Institutions to support students at historic and under-resourced institutions. A recent survey of college presidents conducted by the American Council of Education found that a majority strongly agreed that Higher Education Emergency Relief Funds enabled their institution to keep students enrolled who were at risk of dropping out due to pandemic-related factors. Invested more than $3 billion in American Rescue Plan funds to support children with disabilities. The pandemic and its disruptions to in-person learning had a disproportionate impact on students with disabilities. This funding within the American Rescue Plan is specifically aimed at helping more than 7.9 million infants, toddlers, and students served under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act recover from the pandemic and succeed in the classroom. Use of the funds include hiring additional special education personnel, upgrading technology in schools, procuring professional development for special educators and new educational materials for classrooms, supporting transportation for students with disabilities, and funding before and after-school programs. Released the Return to School Roadmap to help our schools return to in-person learning safely and successfully. The Department launched a nationwide campaign around returning to school in-person this fall and developed resources as part of the “ Return to School Roadmap ” that parents, educators, schools, and communities could use to build confidence and excitement around returning to school in-person. The Department launched a five-state bus tour – the Return to School Road Trip – to celebrate the return to school in fall 2021. And, the Department made available first-of-its-kind funding to keep school districts whole if they were penalized by their state for implementing proven mitigation strategies, like masking, to keep students and staff safe. Discharged $15 billion in federal student loans to over 675,000 borrowers. The Department has provided targeted relief to over 675,000 borrowers through executive action, including providing $1.5 billion to borrowers who have been taken advantage of by their institutions, $7 billion for over 400,000 borrowers who have a total and permanent disability, $1.26 billion to over 100,000 borrowers who attended the now-defunct ITT Technical Institute, and close to $5 billion to 70,000 borrowers through the revamped Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. Revamped the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program to restore its promise to our nation’s public service workers. In October, the Department announced changes to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program to allow borrowers to receive credit for past periods of repayment on loans that may not otherwise qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness. Prior to making changes to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, only 16,000 borrowers had ever received forgiveness through the program, in total. Today, this change has already helped more than 70,000 borrowers qualify for federal student loan forgiveness, totaling close to $5 billion in relief. The Department also communicated with hundreds of thousands of public service workers to let them know the minimum number of payments they would gain credit for towards loan forgiveness under these temporary changes. Issued guidance for supporting students’ mental health. As part of the Department’s effort to help schools reopen safely and address the impacts of the COVID pandemic, the Department released comprehensive guidance on how schools and higher education institutions can address students’ mental health needs , including through using American Rescue Plan funds. The Department encouraged districts and states to use American Rescue Plan funds to hire more mental health professionals, guidance counselors, and incorporate more social, emotional, and mental health resources into K-12 schools and institutions of higher education. Started a comprehensive review of Title IX and held the first-ever national public hearing on the topic. Issued a notification to the public that the Department interprets Title IX to cover sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination. The U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights issued a Notice of Interpretation explaining that it will fully enforce Title IX to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. The Department also started a comprehensive review of Title IX to implement President Biden’s Executive Orders guaranteeing educational environments free from discrimination and on preventing and combating discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation. Awarded or released $6.7 billion in additional pandemic relief and other grant funds to Puerto Rico. In June, U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona announced that the Puerto Rico Department of Education now has full access to all federal education pandemic relief funds earmarked for the Commonwealth and other education program grant dollars that were previously withheld. In partnership with schools, districts, and state leaders, the Department has made great strides in supporting the reopening of our nation’s schools and colleges, and helping students and teachers return safely to in-person learning. As 2022 begins, the Department remains committed to delivering necessary supports to our schools, students, and teachers, while continuing to advance President Biden’s vision of building our education system back better than before the COVID-19 pandemic."
20-Jan-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-takes-actions-support-students%E2%80%99-basic-needs-and-mitigate-spread-covid-19-colleges-and-universities,Biden-Harris Administration Takes Actions to Support Students’ Basic Needs and Mitigate the Spread of COVID-19 at Colleges and Universities,"Today, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) announced more resources for students and institutions to help reduce barriers to success in higher education, particularly those created and exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic—including the Omicron variant. Today’s announcements include: an additional $198 million in American Rescue Plan funds that will primarily support community colleges and other institutions with the greatest needs; new guidance on how colleges can use these new and existing federal funds to meet students’ basic needs such as housing and food security; and guidance on how colleges can use existing data to connect students to other federal benefits, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the Affordable Connectivity Program at the Federal Communications Commission. U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona and First Lady Jill Biden will highlight these new actions during a visit today to Bergen County Community College in New Jersey, which has used federal pandemic relief funds to support its students’ basic needs, including providing access to childcare on campus for student parents, discharging unpaid student balances so students can remain enrolled, and bolstering mental health counseling programs. “In speaking with students from across the country at all different types of higher education institutions, I have heard consistently that the pandemic has exacerbated challenges in meeting students’ basic needs, from housing, to food, to transportation, and more,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “We cannot let this be a barrier to student success, particularly for students who have contended with these issues for far too long. The resources we are announcing today will be critical to ensuring that students can persist and successfully complete their degree programs without having to worry about where their next meal will come from or whether they will be able to find childcare for their children.” The American Rescue Plan provided nearly $40 billion for colleges and universities through the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF). The American Rescue Plan has made historic investments in many of our nation’s historic or under-resourced institutions that educate students whose communities were most acutely affected by the pandemic. These investments include more than $10 billion to community colleges, more than $2.6 billion to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), approximately $190 million to Tribally Controlled Colleges and Universities (TCCUs), and more than $13 billion to Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs), such as Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) and Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institutions (AANAPISIs). This funding has been a necessary lifeline to aid colleges in meeting urgent public health needs to prevent and respond to the Coronavirus pandemic. According to a recent survey of college presidents conducted by the American Council on Education, nearly 90 percent of institutions used HEERF to purchase COVID-19 tests, conduct health screening, and meet other urgent health needs. Colleges have also used funds to support the continued enrollment and re-enrollment of students while expanding access to programs that lead to in-demand jobs. Examples of colleges using HEERF to prevent and respond to the Coronavirus: COVID-19 Mitigation : East Carolina University in North Carolina is using HEERF to cover the cost of a multi-layered approach toward COVID-19 mitigation including testing, contact tracing, and supplies such as personal protective equipment for students, faculty, and staff. Supporting Continued Enrollment and Re-enrollment : Santa Ana College in California created a campaign to re-engage students that stopped out or didn’t enroll. Staff called students and offered help with registration; connected students to support services including academic counseling and broadband support; and emergency aid from stimulus packages. Forgiving Institutional Debt : Grambling State University in Louisiana used HEERF grant funds to cancel $1.5 million in institutional debt (i.e., unpaid institutional balances) for students. Expanding Programs that Lead to In-Demand Jobs: Johnson County Community College in Kansas used HEERF aid to fund free or low-cost workforce programs for workers who lost their job as a result of the pandemic. Today’s announcements include: Providing access to $198 million in American Rescue Plan funding for students and institutions with the greatest unmet need The Department announced that it will be inviting applications next week for a $198 million grant opportunity under the Supplemental Support under American Rescue Plan (SSARP) program to support colleges and universities with the greatest unmet needs related to the COVID-19 pandemic. In awarding funds, the Department will prioritize community colleges and rural institutions of higher education (IHEs) that serve a high percentage of low-income students and have experienced enrollment declines since the start of the pandemic. Funds will be awarded in late spring. As institutions continue to address the immediate challenges brought on by the pandemic, the Department encourages eligible institutions to use SSARP funds toward 1) evidence-based practices to monitor and suppress Coronavirus, 2) strategies for addressing students’ basic needs, 3) support for students’ continued enrollment and re-enrollment, 4) forgiveness of institutional debts, and 5) the expansion of programs that lead to in-demand jobs. Providing new guidance to colleges and universities on using American Rescue Plan funds to meet students’ basic needs The Department published new guidance to further assist institutions seeking to provide students with the basic needs supports to persist academically and navigate challenges exacerbated by the pandemic. The guidance provides examples of how colleges and universities can use the institutional portion of their HEERF grants to make initial investments into basic needs supports for students and expand the reach of existing supports to help students navigate financial challenges because of the COVID-19 pandemic, including insecurity with housing, food, and childcare. The guidance also highlights leading colleges already using HEERF funds for these efforts, including Bergen County Community College which used HEERF funds to subsidize tuition for their on-campus Child Development Center to remove financial barriers to students’ education. Announcing $5 million in new grant funding toward addressing basic needs The Department is announcing nearly $5 million in grants that were awarded to six community colleges to develop new initiatives to address students’ basic needs. These institutions will implement programs to expand access to food, housing, and healthcare for the students on their campuses. All six award winners are both community colleges and Hispanic Serving Institutions: Montgomery College (MD), Los Angeles City College (CA), Rio Hondo College (CA), Hartnell Community College District (CA), McLennan County Junior College District (TX), and Passaic County Community College (NJ). Connecting students to other federal resources to address basic needs The Department is also sending a Dear Colleague Letter to all public and private higher education institutions informing them that they can use Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA®) data to communicate with students about other public benefits programs that they may be eligible for, such as SNAP and the Affordable Connectivity Program. The letter encourages colleges to coordinate with campus stakeholders, like student organizations, financial aid administrators, or student life groups, to inform their campus community of these benefits. These announcements will enable all institutions to continue to meet the needs of their students through new and existing HEERF funding and keep students on a pathway to graduation and success in the job market. For far too many students, the pandemic has meant missing classes, skipped meals, and housing insecurity, on top of the stress of navigating a novel pandemic and we are hopeful this will help institutions meet those students’ needs even better than they were before. These announcements also reflect the Department’s broader commitment to providing support, resources, and guidance to institutions, students, and communities throughout the pandemic. For more information on HEERF under the American Rescue Plan, please visit our website . The institutions identified are provided as examples and for information purposes only. The inclusion of these entities should not be construed as an endorsement by the U.S. Department of Education, or the federal government, of any product, service, or venture of the institution."

The district entered a voluntary resolution agreement to take steps necessary to ensure that students with disabilities receive the free appropriate public education (FAPE) to which they are entitled, including requiring the district to review its use of restraint and seclusion; assessing whether students with disabilities who were subjected to restraint and seclusion require additional remedies or services, including compensatory education; and developing new systems for documenting the use of restraint or seclusion. “Huron Valley Schools has agreed to take important steps to ensure that students with disabilities in its schools receive the free and appropriate public education to which federal law entitles them,” said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon. OCR reviewed Huron Valley Schools as part of a series of 24 compliance reviews initiated nationwide related to restraint and seclusion, which began in January 2019. OCR’s investigation indicated compliance concerns, including students who were repeatedly subjected to restraint and seclusion that resulted in lost educational time and services, indications that the district did not re-evaluate whether students who were repeatedly restrained and secluded should receive additional or different supports, and the absence of accurate and complete documentation of the use of restraint and seclusion The district’s voluntary agreement to change its practices with respect to the use of restraint and seclusion, and its commitment to examine and remedy prior instances where restraint and seclusion of its students may have denied them a FAPE, reflect the district’s willingness to address the civil rights of its students. The district made significant commitments in the agreement, including, for example: Assessing whether students with disabilities who were subjected to restraint and seclusion from September 2017 through January 2022 were denied a FAPE and require compensatory education. Implementing a policy regarding the appropriate use and documentation of restraint and seclusion. Implementing a monitoring program to assess the district’s use of restraint and seclusion on a monthly basis and developing a policy and forms for documenting and tracking the restraint and seclusion of district students. And, Providing training to staff on restraint and seclusion, the district’s documentation policy and forms, and the requirements of Section 504 and Title II.

18-Jan-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-announces-distribution-all-american-rescue-plan-esser-funds-and-approval-all-52-state-education-agency-plans,U.S. Department of Education Announces Distribution of All American Rescue Plan ESSER Funds and Approval of All 52 State Education Agency Plans,"Today, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) announced that every state education agency (SEA) received approval of their American Rescue Plan Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ARP ESSER) plan before the end of December 2021. As a result, the Department has distributed all $122 billion of ARP ESSER funds to all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. These funds are critical to helping states and local districts safely keep schools open for in-person learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, including responding to recent challenges arising from the Omicron variant. As of last week, with the help of ARP funds, about 96% of K-12 public schools were open for full-time, in-person instruction. The Department recently issued a new resource to state and local leaders stressing the importance of full-time, safe, in-person learning and how federal funds can be used to achieve that goal. Additionally, last week, the Administration announced the availability of millions of new tests each month to help schools safely remain open and implement screening testing and test-to-stay programs. “We reached an important milestone with all 50 states plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico establishing strong plans for the use of American Rescue Plan resources through the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “I am proud that, with the approval of these plans, states have 100% of their funds and robust plans to help schools remain open and help students thrive. We are urging states and school districts to deploy funds now to address the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the Omicron variant, on our school communities. We continue to encourage state and local education leaders to utilize funds for testing, personal protective equipment, and staff recruitment and retention. In areas where these funds are being deployed quickly, we are already seeing the positive impact that this infusion of federal support is having directly in schools and communities. We know what it takes to keep our schools open safely for in-person learning, and these funds will help us achieve that goal.” In March—less than two weeks after President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act into law—the Department distributed two-thirds of the ARP ESSER funds, totaling $81 billion, to 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia. In order to ensure states provided responsible and thoughtful plans for the funds, the remaining third of the funding for each state was made available once a state’s plan was approved. Today’s announcement means all $122 billion in ARP ESSER funding has been distributed to states, with the final plan approved on Dec. 30. Because the Department recognizes that successful use of federal pandemic recovery funds requires input from parents, educators, and other partners, it required that all states and school districts engage with a diverse range of community members as they developed their plans for spending ARP ESSER funds. These communities included students, parents and families, Tribes (if applicable), civil rights organizations (including disability rights organizations), school and district administrators, educators, and stakeholders representing the interests of children with disabilities, English learners, children experiencing homelessness, children and youth in foster care, migratory students, children who are incarcerated, and other underserved students. Throughout the pandemic, the Department has provided guidance and resources to address the ever-changing needs of schools and ensure an effective and efficient use of federal dollars. These efforts have reached thousands of stakeholders through webinars, virtual office hours, and stakeholder engagement sessions, providing guidance and answering questions on how to use ARP funds to address critical issues such as labor shortages, expanding access to vaccinations and implementing mitigation strategies making updates to school infrastructure and ventilation systems, Maintenance of Effort and Maintenance of Equity provisions of ARP ESSER, and supporting students experiencing homelessness and students with disabilities, among other topics. Fact sheets are available for each state’s ARP ESSER plan outlining how each state will use their funds. In addition, the Department’s website now includes links to school districts’ plans for the use of these funds, which each State Education Agency (SEA) is required to post for public transparency. Highlights from across the country demonstrate the efforts of SEAs and school districts to address the urgent needs of their schools with ventilation improvements, staff hiring and retention, mental health services, high-dosage tutoring programs, after-school and summer learning partnerships, and more. For example: Safely Reopening Schools and Sustaining Safe Operations: The Vermont Agency of Education (AOE) is partnering with other statewide agencies to vaccinate all Vermonters, including eligible students. AOE will use $1 million in ARP ESSER funds to support a Vaccine Incentive Program that will make awards to schools that achieve a student vaccination rate of 85% or higher. Vermont has achieved a high rate of vaccination for eligible student populations by targeting vaccine clinics to school sites, a sustained interagency public information campaign, and through the leadership and support of school administrators and staff. As of Jan. 14, 75% of people ages 12-17 had received at least one dose of vaccine. To build on this success, beginning in 2022, additional funds through the Vaccine Incentive Program will further encourage vaccination for all Vermont students. The Hawaii Department of Education (HIDOE) has worked with the state Department of Health and local healthcare providers to host vaccination clinics for staff, students, and school communities across the state. HIDOE has hosted 45 vaccination clinics since students became eligible for the vaccine. According to an analysis of ARP ESSER spending, Los Angeles Unified School District will use ARP ESSER funds to purchase 55,000 air scrubbers. Data, tracked by Burbio , show more than 40% of districts plan to spend ARP ESSER funds on HVAC improvements. Harnett School District in North Carolina is using ARP ESSER funds to construct additions to their school to reduce class size and increase instructional space for five schools. Addressing the Academic Impact of Lost Instructional Time: Using American Rescue Plan funds, Arkansas created the Arkansas Tutoring Corps, which includes recruitment, preparation, and support for candidates to become qualified tutors to provide instruction or intervention to meet the academic needs of at-risk learners or students most impacted by lost instructional time. The Arkansas Tutoring Corps project will enhance learning experiences of students impacted by lost instructional time as a result of the pandemic and address gaps in foundational skills in mathematics and literacy. New Jersey established an “Acceleration Coach and Educator Support” formula grant for districts. Districts will use the grant funds to implement professional learning for staff so that they better accelerate the learning of their students. New Jersey will use a weighted enrollment allocation formula that provides more funds to support students from lower grade bands, Limited English Proficient students, and students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch. Tennessee is using ARP ESSER funds to provide access to high-dosage, low-ratio tutoring over the next three years. When the program is fully operational, as many as 240,000 students will have access to 300-500 additional hours of targeted support through tutoring to address the lost instructional time from the pandemic. Dayton, Ohio, is using ARP ESSER funds to hire two times as many teachers in classrooms for grades 1-3 and pursue other interventions such as math specialists for grades 4-6 to help students catch up more quickly. Supporting the Educator Workforce: The Colorado Department of Education will use ARP ESSER funding to create opportunities that encourage prospective educators to enter the workforce, recruit high-quality educators to Colorado schools, and establish mentoring retention programs that provide support to new-to-service educators while also providing professional growth opportunities for experienced educators. These investments will address teacher shortages and help teachers better address the impact of the pandemic on students. The South Carolina Department of Education (SCDE) will use ARP ESSER funds to collaborate with institutions of higher education, including the South Carolina Commission on Higher Education and the South Carolina Technical College System, to employ post-secondary students as summer teaching interns beginning in 2021. Students will receive a stipend and be trained to deliver high-quality, evidence-based instruction in after-school and summer learning opportunities, accelerating the learning of students. Given staff shortages, SCDE also will collaborate with other entities to develop a pipeline of new talent to attract diverse candidates for positions in the classroom, as well as launch pathways for entering the teaching profession and a communication platform to promote the pathways. Cut Bank schools in Montana provided a $1,500 retention stipend for all employees using ARP ESSER dollars. Investing in Early Learning: The North Dakota Department of Public Instruction is partnering with North Dakota Department of Human Services to use $7 million of ARP ESSER funds to offer high-quality, well-resourced classrooms for 4-year-olds through grants of $120,000 available to public, private, and religious organizations. This investment in early learning will help address the pandemic’s impact on the social and emotional health of children. The classroom cohort size can be no larger than 14 students, and programs must adhere to exemplar professional development and instructional strategy coaching guidelines. As states amend their plans to reflect additional required information and changes as their strategies evolve, updated state plans will continue to be posted on the Department’s website. The distribution of ARP ESSER funds is part of the Department’s broader effort to support students and districts as they work to re-engage students impacted by the pandemic and address inequities exacerbated by COVID-19. In addition to providing $130 billion for K-12 education in the American Rescue Plan, including funds beyond the ARP ESSER program, the Biden-Harris Administration also has assisted with: Vaccines: Prioritized the vaccination of educators, school staff and child care workers leading to more than 90% of school staff vaccinated nationwide. Provided guidance and federal dollars for schools to hold vaccination clinics. Testing: Provided $10 billion in funding for COVID-19 testing for PreK-12 educators, staff, and students. As part of the Administration’s efforts to increase access to and implementation of testing programs in schools, the Administration partnered with the CDC and the Rockefeller Foundation to provide resources to help ensure that all schools can access and set up screening testing programs as quickly as possible. The Department also provided a FAQ outlining allowable use of funds for ESSER and the Governor’s Emergency Education Relief (GEER) Fund for coronavirus testing among other uses, and took new actions to increase access to COVID-19 testing in schools, including increasing the number of COVID-19 tests available to schools by 10 million per month to help schools safely remain open and implement screening testing and test to stay programs, and supporting free testing access for students, school staff, and families through federal testing sites. Labor Shortages: The Department took a suite of actions to address labor shortages impacting schools: 1) A Dear Colleague Letter to state school chiefs and district superintendents, made it clear how ARP ESSER funds can be used to address labor shortages impacting schools. 2) Issued FAQs through the Internal Revenue Service clarifying that, in some instances, retirees can return to work and still receive their pensions. 3) Through the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, gave states the option to temporarily waive the portion of the commercial driver’s license (CDL) skills test that requires applicants to identify the “under the hood” engine components in order to increase the supply of qualified school bus drivers. 4) Clarified that Department funds can be used to facilitate hiring AmeriCorps members to support schools and students, easing burdens on staff. Resources to Support Implementation: The Department released resources on how schools can address transportation issues , implement COVID-19 testing protocols and encourage vaccinations , and address the impact of lost instructional time . The Department released resources on how schools can address transportation issues , implement COVID-19 testing protocols and encourage vaccinations , and address the impact of lost instructional time . The Department also: 1) Hosted a National Safe School Reopening Summit highlighting how districts are implementing COVID-19 mitigation practices and addressing the needs of students. 2)Developed a Safer Schools and Campuses Best Practices Clearinghouse elevating hundreds of best practices to support schools’ efforts to reopen safely and address the impacts of COVID-19 on students, educators, and communities. 3) Announced new mental health resources to provide information and resources to enhance the promotion of mental health and the social and emotional well-being among children and students. 4) Released three volumes of the COVID-19 Handbook to identify evidence-based strategies to meet the social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs of students and support the educator workforce. 5) Released a report on the disparate impacts of COVID-19 on underserved communities. In addition to the actions the Biden Administration has taken to reopen schools, the President has proposed critical investments through his Build Back Better Agenda. The Build Back Better legislation will offer universal and free preschool for all 3- and 4-year-olds, make child care and education beyond high school more affordable, create more training and apprenticeship opportunities, increase the maximum Pell Grant, and provide historic investments in Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal Colleges and Universities, and minority-serving institutions."
14-Jan-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-issues-guidance-federal-funds-support-afghan-and-other-newcomer-students,U.S. Department of Education Issues Guidance on Federal Funds to Support Afghan and Other Newcomer Students,"Today, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) issued a Dear Colleague Letter (DCL) to Chief State School Officers detailing information about federal funds and resources available to support Afghan children and their families, who have recently arrived or may be arriving soon to states and school districts across the country. As part of Operation Allies Welcome, a unified approach led by the Department of Homeland Security to coordinate federal government efforts to support vulnerable Afghans, the Department recognizes the immediate and urgent need to provide high-quality, culturally responsive education to Afghan newcomers—inclusive of primary, secondary, and English language learning as well as social-emotional learning. ""All learners have a right to high-quality educational experiences,"" said Deputy Secretary Cindy Marten. ""Our recent Afghan arrivals and their families have supported our country over the last 20 years, and we will keep our promise to them by providing access to equitable and excellent educational opportunities. The U.S. Department of Education stands ready to support states and local districts as they welcome these important new members of our communities."" Recognizing that all children in the United States have an equal right to enroll and participate in public elementary and secondary schools, this DCL explains several sources of federal funding available to state educational agencies (SEAs) and local educational agencies (LEAs). Although the letter is specific to Afghan children and their families, the information applies to children and families arriving from other countries as well. SEAs and LEAs may use funds under the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) Fund and the Governor's Emergency Education Relief (GEER) Fund to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on recently arrived children, including leveraging these funds to develop culturally and linguistically relevant instructional materials as well as materials and assessments in other languages. In addition, federal education funds from the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) can be used to support recently arrived children, and the DCL includes a short summary of how funds under Title I, Part A; Title III, Part A; Title IV, Part A; and Title IV, Part B of the ESEA and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act can be used by states, LEAs, and schools to support recently arrived students. In addition to an overview of federal funds, this letter contains resources that LEAs may use as they fulfill their obligations to not only providing all students with free public education but also determining eligibility for and offering services to support students with limited English proficiency and students with disabilities. These resources include tool kits, fact sheets, and other Dear Colleague Letters. A Keeping the Promise website has been launched, and inquiries into these efforts may be addressed to KeepingthePromise@ed.gov ."
12-Jan-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-increases-covid-19-testing-schools-keep-students-safe-and-schools-open,FACT SHEET: Biden-Harris Administration Increases COVID-19 Testing in Schools to Keep Students Safe and Schools Open,"This Fact Sheet was originally posted by The White House and is available here: https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/12/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-increases-covid-19-testing-in-schools-to-keep-students-safe-and-schools-open/ Since day one, the Biden-Harris Administration has taken every step available to keep schools safely open for full-time, in-person instruction. These efforts have resulted in 96% of schools open in-person in January 2022, up from 46% of schools in January 2021. Students have sacrificed so much over the course of the pandemic, and the President has been clear in his words and his actions that his Administration will do all that it can to keep schools safely open for all students. Today the Biden-Harris Administration is doubling down on our commitment to keeping all schools safely open for full-time in-person learning by taking new action to increase access to COVID-19 testing in schools. Through these new initiatives, the Administration will increase the number of COVID-19 tests available to schools by 10 million per month. These additional tests will help schools safely remain open and implement screening testing and test to stay programs. With the additional ten million tests per month, we will make available to schools more than double the volume of testing that took place in schools across the nation in November 2021 (the most recent data available). We know how to keep students and staff safely in school—including through vaccinations and boosters, implementing universal indoor masking, maintaining physical distancing, improving ventilation, and performing COVID-19 screening testing. Over the past year, the Biden-Harris Administration has provided historic funding and extensive resources to states and school districts across the country to make sure schools reopen and remain open – including $130 billion in the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief fund to safely reopen schools and address students’ academic and mental health needs, and $10 billion in the Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity (ELC) cooperative agreement to support COVID-19 testing for students and staff. Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is increasing COVID-19 testing for schools by: Sending 5 Million No-Cost Point-of-Care Tests Per Month to Schools. The Administration will distribute 5 million free, rapid tests to schools each month to help K-12 schools stay open and to implement and sustain screening testing and test to stay programs in accordance with guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This new allocation builds on the CDC Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity (ELC) program, which distributed $10 billion in resources to states to support COVID-19 testing in schools. CDC will work with states who can submit requests to receive additional tests for high-need school districts that can put these tests immediately to use. After states submit initial requests, the first shipments will be delivered later this month. Providing 5 Million Additional Lab-Based PCR Tests for Free to Schools Per Month: The Administration is making available lab capacity to support an additional 5 million PCR tests per month for schools to perform individual and pooled testing in classrooms nationwide. The additional testing will be delivered through the Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) Operation Expanded Testing (ET) program, funded by the American Rescue Plan to provide free PCR testing at schools nationwide. Three federally funded regional providers offer testing materials, supplies, and lab results and reporting at no direct cost to recipients through four regional hubs. Schools can immediately gain access to this free lab-based testing. Deploying Federal Surge Testing Units to Support Free Testing Access for Students, School Staff, and Families at Community Testing Sites. HHS and FEMA are working with state, territorial, and tribal partners to address testing needs in communities and stand up federal testing sites. These surge testing sites are focused on ensuring hardest-hit and highest-risk communities have equitable access to free and convenient testing. Effective immediately, as the agencies review state, territorial, and tribal requests, they will consider how these sites can support the safe operations of K-12 schools. Opportunities to support K-12 schools may include locating federal testing units on or near school grounds; establishing specific operating hours for students, their families, and school staff; or dedicating a specific portion of daily testing to school communities. By incorporating school needs, state leaders can more effectively build school testing into their requests and planning while surge test sites continue to provide robust access to communities with greatest need. Connecting Schools with COVID-19 Testing Providers to Set Up School Testing Programs using American Rescue Plan Funds. In addition to $10 billion for states to set up K-12 testing programs in the ELC program, the American Rescue Plan included $130 billion in the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief fund to safely reopen schools, which may be used to support school-based COVID-19 testing. To support schools that want to set up COVID-19 testing programs, the Department of Education (ED) and CDC will work with states and outside organizations to help schools make connections to testing providers that are available in their state. This includes connecting local school districts with the testing providers contracted by their states to set up COVID-19 testing in school using ELC funding. While programs vary by state, these arrangements allow schools to access testing resources quickly and coordinated with statewide activities, including accessing test supply and administration. Schools should contact their jurisdiction to join existing state efforts funded by ELC. CDC and ED will also engage schools to help them learn how to set up testing programs and how they can use their American Rescue Plan funds to support them New Training, Resources, and Materials for Implementing Test to Stay in Schools. Last month, CDC released guidance on “test to stay,” an approach that allows students to remain safely in the classroom during their quarantine period as long as they wear masks and test at least two times in the seven days following an exposure. Test to stay programs are an effective approach for identifying and containing infection at school, and help enable schools to minimize and avoid interruptions to in-person instruction. Later this week, CDC will release additional materials for schools on how to implement test to stay programs, including a school checklist and frequently asked questions and answers. Additionally, ED and CDC will continue to provide additional opportunities for states and school districts to learn about test to stay and how to effectively implement test to stay approaches in school. The actions announced today build on more than $10 billion in investments that the Biden-Harris Administration has made in setting up testing programs in K-12 schools. School districts can also take advantage of the below resources immediately, as outlined in a letter Secretary Cardona is sending this week to school officials demonstrating available resources to support COVID-19 testing and urging them to get started today. Supports also include: Free Community COVID-19 Testing Sites. Schools may consider referring students, teachers, and staff to community-based testing sites that are supported by federal funding. HHS continues to work with pharmacies and retail companies to accelerate testing for more Americans in communities across the country. Full Reimbursement for COVID-19 Testing Programs. FEMA’s Public Assistance Program continues to provide federal funding to states, tribal nations, territories and localities to support COVID-19 testing. This includes testing needed to safely open and operate public facilities, including K-12 schools. 100% reimbursement is available for schools and localities to set up diagnostic and screening testing programs. This provides an important way for communities to expand upon federal surge testing sites by providing resources for state and local leaders to open and operate additional testing sites in partnership with schools."
11-Jan-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-emphasizes-importance-full-service-community-schools-through-competitive-grant-program,U.S. Department of Education Emphasizes Importance of Full-Service Community Schools Through Competitive Grant Program,"Today, the U.S. Department of Education released the Notice of Proposed Priorities, definitions, and requirements for the Full-Service Community Schools competitive grant program and tomorrow is launching a 30-day public comment period for the program. These proposed priorities align with the vision set forth by the Biden-Harris Administration and U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona in support of high-quality educational opportunities for all students and the important role of full-service community schools in providing wraparound and academic supports to students and families that are critical in their academic success. Full-service community schools work collaboratively with students’ families and leverage community-based resources to provide a tailored set of coordinated services and programs to a school community. Community schools meet student social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs through after school and summer learning and enrichment opportunities, as well as mental and physical health services. During the pandemic, community schools, for example, re-engaged students, hosted vaccine clinics, provided meals, and secured technology to ensure students can access remote learning. “Community schools play a vital role in achieving President Biden’s vision of building our education system back better than before the pandemic,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “The last two years have taught us how critical schools can be in providing wraparound supports to students and families—such as access to mental health services, basic needs, and high-quality academic instruction. When schools are at the center of our neighborhoods and communities, children, youth, and families benefit. I am thrilled that this program can enable more students and families to access full-service community schools, and that President Biden proposed in his budget to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in community schools, which have been proven to improve student well-being and academic success.” Since 2010, the Full-Service Community Schools competitive grant program has supported 55 distinct communities in all regions of the country. President Biden’s FY22 budget includes a proposed increase of $413 million for the Full-Service Community Schools program. This request would expand the capacity of the program to serve up to 2.5 million students, families, and community members in an estimated 800 new community schools. The proposed priorities are intended to encourage quality implementation of the four pillars of community schools: integrated student supports that address out-of-school barriers to learning through partnerships with social and health service agencies and providers; expanded and enriched learning time and opportunities; active family and community engagement; and collaborative leadership and practices. The proposed priorities released today address: Supporting states and districts in scaling up high-quality community schools within and across school districts; Encouraging evidence-based strategies for integrated student supports; and Supporting a national evaluation to continue to build the evidence base behind effective community schools. Full-service community schools can help ensure that students’ opportunities are not limited by zip code, family income, race/ethnicity, disability status, or other factors by strengthening a school’s conditions for excellent teaching and learning. The community school approach leverages existing community assets, and generates new resources, to bring needed supports for students and families into public schools. Educators at community schools engage parents and families as full partners in their child’s education. Community schools often offer courses, activities, and services for parents and engage families and community members in school decision making. This year in particular, the community school strategy has enabled educators to address the challenges confronting students as they returned to in-person learning. These strategies are also critical ways to re-engage students with the appropriate integrated supports. Research shows that evidence-based approaches to community schools can improve student social, emotional, and academic outcomes.

7-Jan-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-approves-floridas-plan-use-american-rescue-plan-funds-support-k-12-schools-and-students-distributes-remaining-23-billion-state,"U.S. Department of Education Approves Florida’s Plan for Use of American Rescue Plan Funds to Support K-12 Schools and Students, Distributes Remaining $2.3 Billion to State","Today, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) announced the approval of Florida’s American Rescue Plan Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ARP ESSER) plan and distribution of the remaining funds. Florida’s plan details how the state is using and plans to use ARP ESSER funds to sustain the safe operation of schools and equitably expand opportunity for students who need it most, particularly those most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. As of this week, with the help of American Rescue Plan funds, about 96% of all schools were open for full-time, in-person instruction. The Department recently issued a new resource to state and local leaders stressing the importance of full-time, safe, in-person learning and how federal funds can be used to achieve that goal. Earlier this year, the Department distributed two-thirds of the ARP ESSER funds, totaling $81 billion, to 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia. The remaining third of the funding to states was made available once a state’s plan was approved. Florida received more than $7 billion total in ARP ESSER funds, and the approval of their plan released the final $2.3 billion. All 52 ARP ESSER state plans have been approved. “I am excited to announce approval of Florida’s plan,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “It is heartening to see, reflected in these state plans, the ways in which states are thinking deeply about how to use American Rescue Plan funds to continue to provide critical support to schools and communities. The approval of these plans enables states to receive vital, additional American Rescue Plan funds to help keep schools open for full-time, in-person learning; meet students’ academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs; and address disparities in access to educational opportunity that were exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. The state plans that have been submitted to the Department lay the groundwork for the ways in which an unprecedented infusion of federal resources will be used to address the urgent needs of America’s children and build back better.” “As COVID-19 rates soar across Florida, this federal funding is a vital lifeline to keeping children and classrooms safe and safeguarding our productive learning environments across the state,” said Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz. “The unwavering leadership of President Biden and Secretary Cardona has been critical to ensuring that students, teachers, and staff can maintain academic success, as well as physical, social, and emotional support, as top education priorities throughout this pandemic.” “As our country continues navigating the difficult intricacies of the COVID-19 pandemic, we must consider the effects our decisions on the state and federal levels will have on our students,” said Rep. Darren Soto. “I am thrilled to see the Department of Education approve Florida’s plan because it will allow us to mitigate learning loss, enhance support services, and promote the mental and physical health of our students. Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, we have been able to provide desperately needed resources to our most vulnerable populations and give the American people a chance to recover from this once-in-a-lifetime crisis.” “After voting to advance the American Rescue Plan through the House Education and Labor Committee and on the House floor, I am incredibly pleased that the U.S. Department of Education has approved Florida’s ARP ESSER plan,” said Rep. Frederica S. Wilson. “Florida will now receive the outstanding portion of its $7 billion ARP ESSER award, which will better equip school districts to safely maintain in-person learning and provide resources to support the overall well-being of students, teachers and support staff during the ongoing Coronavirus pandemic. Thankfully, school districts can now rely on these critical resources to meet local needs and ensure education equity.” The ARP ESSER state plans approved by the Department, including Florida’s, show how states are using federal pandemic resources to support safe, in-person instruction and meet the social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs of students—with a focus on the students most impacted by the pandemic. For example: Addressing the Academic Impact of Lost Instructional Time: The Florida Department of Education (FDOE) will use ARP ESSER funding to implement a tutoring initiative for students in the early grades focused on closing gaps that have been exacerbated by the pandemic. FDOE also will provide grants to all school districts to invest in evidence-based reading strategies and professional development aligned to the science of reading, including deploying literacy coaches. In addition, FDOE will use ARP ESSER funds to provide formula grants to expand access to STEM programs, to support math acceleration and expand computer science credentials in high schools. Investing in Summer Learning and Expanded Afterschool Programs: FDOE will provide matching grants to school districts to enhance or create evidence-based summer learning programs with a focus on reading achievement and evidence-based comprehensive afterschool and weekend programs to support acceleration in literacy achievement. The distribution of ARP ESSER funds is part of the Department’s broader effort to support students and districts as they work to re-engage students impacted by the pandemic, address inequities exacerbated by COVID-19, and build our education system back better than before. In addition to providing $130 billion for K-12 education in the American Rescue Plan to support the safe reopening of K-12 schools and meet the needs of all students, the Biden-Harris Administration also has: Prioritized the vaccination of educators, school staff and child care workers leading to more than 90% of school staff vaccinated nationwide. Hosted a National Safe School Reopening Summit and launched a series of Equity Summits focused on addressing inequities that existed before but were made worse by the pandemic. Provided $10 billion in funding for COVID-19 testing for PreK-12 educators, staff, and students. As part of the Administration’s efforts to increase access to and implementation of testing programs in schools, the Administration partnered with the CDC and the Rockefeller Foundation to provide resources to help ensure that all schools can access and set up screening testing programs as quickly as possible. The Department also provided a FAQ outlining allowable use of funds for ESSER and the Governor’s Emergency Education Relief Fund for coronavirus testing among other uses. Developed a Safer Schools and Campuses Best Practices Clearinghouse elevating hundreds of best practices to support schools’ efforts to reopen safely and address the impacts of COVID-19 on students, educators, and communities. Announced new mental health resources to provide information and resources to enhance the promotion of mental health and the social and emotional well-being among children and students. Released three volumes of the COVID-19 Handbook to identify evidence-based strategies to meet the social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs of students and support the educator workforce. Released a report on the disparate impacts of COVID-19 on underserved communities. In addition to the actions the Biden Administration has taken to reopen schools, the President has proposed critical investments through his Build Back Better Agenda. The Build Back Better legislation will offer universal and free preschool for all 3- and 4-year-olds, make child care and education beyond high school more affordable, create more training and apprenticeship opportunities, increase the maximum Pell Grant, and provide historic investments in Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal Colleges and Universities, and minority-serving institutions."
4-Jan-22,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-announces-joint-temporary-action-us-department-transportation-help-address-school-bus-driver-labor-shortage,U.S. Department of Education Announces Joint Temporary Action with U.S. Department of Transportation to Help Address School Bus Driver Labor Shortage,"Today, the U.S. Department of Transportation announced, in coordination with the U.S. Department of Education (Department), that the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) is giving states the option of waiving the portion of the commercial driver’s license (CDL) skills test that requires applicants to identify the “under the hood” engine components. All other components of the written and road test will remain. This announcement aims to alleviate some of the labor shortage challenges schools are facing and is one of many resources the Department continues to provide to safely keep schools open for full-time, in-person learning. “This Administration is listening to the needs of school communities and remains committed to making sure schools are open safely for in-person learning full time,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “We’ve heard from educators and parents that labor shortages, particularly of bus drivers, are a roadblock to keeping kids in schools. Today’s announcement will give states the flexibility they need to help increase the pool of drivers, who are a key part of the school community, and get kids to school safely each day where students learn best. And American Rescue Plan funds can be used to hire these critical staff, including offering increased compensation or other incentives to recruit and retain staff.” “This federal waiver will help states that are short on bus drivers,” said U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. “By allowing states to focus on the testing requirements that are critical to safety, we will get additional, qualified drivers behind the wheel to get kids to school safely.” Drivers receiving a CDL under this temporary waiver are permitted to operate intrastate school buses only; they are not authorized to operate trucks, motorcoaches, or any other type of commercial motor vehicle requiring a CDL. The FMCSA waiver, which became effective Jan. 3, 2022, expires March 31, 2022. As of December , with the help of American Rescue Plan funds and other efforts, nearly all schools were open for full-time, in-person instruction. The Department recently issued a new resource to state and local leaders stressing the importance of full-time, safe, in-person learning and how federal funds can be used to achieve that goal including to effectively recruit and retain staff. Last month, Secretary Cardona outlined actions the Biden Administration was taking to address labor shortages in schools. The Secretary sent a letter to state and local leaders demonstrating how schools and states are using American Rescue Plan funds to address labor shortages across the country. In November, the Department issued an FAQ on how schools can use American Rescue Plan funds to address transportation issues that might disrupt in-person learning. The Department also hosted webinars to assist districts in using federal dollars to recruit, retain, and hire additional staff. Additionally, the Internal Revenue Service has issued FAQs clarifying that, in some instances, retirees can return to work and still receive their pensions Today’s waiver and the resources provided by the Department underscore the Administration’s commitment to safe, in-person learning. In addition to these resources and the more than $130 billion for K-12 education in the American Rescue Plan, the Biden-Harris Administration has: Prioritized the vaccination of educators, school staff and child care workers leading to more than 90% of school staff vaccinated nationwide. Hosted a National Safe School Reopening Summit . Partnered with the CDC and the Rockefeller Foundation to provide resources to help ensure that all schools can access and set up screening testing programs as quickly as possible.

Vermont’s plan details how the state is using and plans to use ARP ESSER funds to sustain the safe operation of schools and equitably expand opportunity for students who need it most, particularly those most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. As of December , with the help of American Rescue Plan funds, nearly all schools are open for full-time, in-person instruction. The Department recently issued a new resource to state and local leaders stressing the importance of full-time, safe, in-person learning and how federal funds can be used to achieve that goal. Earlier this year, the Department distributed two-thirds of the ARP ESSER funds, totaling $81 billion, to 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia. The remaining third of the funding to states will be made available once state plans are approved. Vermont is receiving more than $285 million total in ARP ESSER funds, and today’s approval of their plan will result in the release of the final $95 million. Today’s approvals mean a total of 51 ARP ESSER state plans have been approved since June. “I am excited to announce approval of Vermont’s plan,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “It is heartening to see, reflected in these state plans, the ways in which states are thinking deeply about how to use American Rescue Plan funds to continue to provide critical support to schools and communities. The approval of these plans enables states to receive vital, additional American Rescue Plan funds to help keep schools open for full-time, in-person learning; meet students’ academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs; and address disparities in access to educational opportunity that were exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. The state plans that have been submitted to the Department lay the groundwork for the ways in which an unprecedented infusion of federal resources will be used to address the urgent needs of America’s children and build back better.” “With the input of stakeholders statewide, Vermont developed a plan to leverage these transformative federal funds through pandemic response to education recovery and beyond,” said Vermont Secretary of Education Dan French. “The plan addresses the pressing social emotional and academic needs of Vermont students in our schools today, while making investments that will transform brick and mortar facilities and reimagine education for Vermont students in the future.” “This pandemic has been incredibly difficult for everyone, including learning losses for our students,” said Sen. Patrick Leahy. “The Biden-Harris Administration and Congress have risen to these unprecedented challenges with resources through the American Rescue Plan. I am glad to see the Department of Education approve Vermont’s plan. These investments in Vermont will promote safe learning and help us deal with learning loss and the social and emotional toll that the last year has taken on Vermont’s students, educators and communities.” “It is no secret that this has been a disruptive time for all of us, but especially for our young people,” said Sen. Bernie Sanders. “It is absolutely essential that we do everything we possibly can to support Vermont students in the coming months and years as we recover from these challenges. That is why I am very proud to have secured significant funding for summer and after school programming and community schools in the American Rescue Plan and this new funding from the Department of Education gives us a real opportunity to continue the programs that our students want and need. Together, we can ensure young people throughout our state, from Pre-K to 12th grade, do not miss out on critical opportunities even during a global pandemic.” “This pandemic has been an unprecedented challenge for students, parents, and educators,” said Rep. Peter Welch. “I’m pleased that the Department of Education has approved Vermont’s plans to use funds from the American Rescue Plan’s Elementary and Secondary Emergency Relief program to support our school communities. With these resources, Vermont students will receive the help they need to learn and grow through the ongoing pandemic, and educators will be supported in the critical work they do for our children and communities. ESSER ARP funds are essential to regaining lost learning and addressing educational disparities highlighted by the pandemic. The pandemic has also taken a toll on the emotional wellbeing of our students, parents and educators and this aid will help us begin to heal in a more complete way.” The ARP ESSER state plans approved by the Department, including Vermont’s, show how states are using federal pandemic resources to support safe in-person instruction and meet the social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs of students—with a focus on the students most impacted by the pandemic. For example: Safely Reopening Schools and Sustaining Safe Operations: The Vermont Agency of Education (AOE) is partnering with other statewide agencies to vaccinate all Vermonters, including eligible students. AOE will use $1 million in ARP ESSER funds to support a Vaccine Incentive Program that will make awards to schools that achieve a student vaccination rate of 85 % or higher. Vermont has achieved a high rate of vaccination for eligible student populations by targeting vaccine clinics to school sites, and through a sustained interagency public information campaign and the leadership and support of school administrators and staff. To build on this success, beginning in 2022 additional funds through the Vaccine Incentive Program will further encourage vaccination for all Vermont students. Addressing the Academic Impact of Lost Instructional Time: AOE is prioritizing early literacy with the use of ARP ESSER funds. Vermont is using $3 million to support teachers in delivering evidence-based practices for literacy instruction, with a focus on students in kindergarten through third grade. Expanding Access to Community Schools: AOE is using ARP ESSER funds to launch a multi-year program to implement Community Schools across the state. Vermont’s Community Schools will embed medical, mental health, social services, and other supports within the school setting, especially to meet the needs of rural communities. AOE used ARP ESSER funds to award five grants for Community Schools this fall. The distribution of ARP ESSER funds is part of the Department’s broader effort to support students and districts as they work to reengage students impacted by the pandemic, address inequities exacerbated by COVID-19, and build our education system back better than before. In addition to providing $130 billion for K-12 education in the American Rescue Plan to support the safe reopening of K-12 schools and meet the needs of all students, the Biden-Harris Administration also has: Held the Return To School Road Trip , a bus tour that visited schools across five states in five days to celebrate the safe return to school Announced new mental health resources to provide information and resources to enhance the promotion of mental health and the social and emotional well-being among children and students.

Thompson. “As the only Mississippi representative to vote for the American Rescue Plan, I am glad to see the Department of Education approve Mississippi’s plan. These resources greatly benefit our communities and will help get us safely back to school in the fall and address learning loss.” “Mississippi has prioritized in-person learning because it is the most effective way to keep students engaged, accelerate learning and address their social and emotional learning needs,” said Dr. Carey Wright, Mississippi state superintendent of education. “We are grateful to the U.S. Department of Education for its significant investment of ESSER funds in Mississippi. These funds will enable our schools to innovate learning and build strong and enduring systems of support to meet the current and future needs of our students.” The ARP ESSER state plans approved by the Department, including Mississippi’s, show how states are using Federal pandemic resources to support safe in-person instruction and meet the social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs of students—with a focus on the students most impacted by the pandemic. For example: Safely Reopening Schools and Sustaining Safe Operations: The Mississippi Department of Education (MDE) has encouraged districts to consider how to host vaccination drives on school campuses, in addition to sharing Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommendations and guidance on safe in-person instruction with schools and districts in the state. Mississippi schools have also utilized various strategies to increase vaccination rates in the schools and communities. Addressing the Academic Impact of Lost Instructional Time: MDE will use ARP ESSER funds to support high-dosage tutoring, summer learning and enrichment, and extended day programs through a competitive grant program to address students’ academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs that the state is developing. Supporting Physical and Mental Health: MDE has launched a behavioral telehealth project in response to mental health concerns that may have been exacerbated by the pandemic, staffed by school staff. MDE is also using ARP funds for a pilot program to deliver mental and behavioral health care to children and increase educator knowledge about behavioral management techniques. Additionally, MDE has awarded funds to put 25 new medical staff on-site in schools. The distribution of ARP ESSER funds is part of the Department’s broader effort to support students and districts as they work to reengage students impacted by the pandemic, address inequities exacerbated by COVID-19, and build our education system back better than before.

22-Dec-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-extends-student-loan-pause-through-may-1-2022,"Biden-Harris Administration Extends Student Loan Pause Through May 1, 2022","Today, the U.S. Department of Education announced a 90-day extension of the pause on student loan repayment, interest, and collections through May 1, 2022. The extension will allow the Administration to assess the impacts of the Omicron variant on student borrowers and provide additional time for borrowers to plan for the resumption of payments and reduce the risk of delinquency and defaults after restart. The Department will continue its work to transition borrowers smoothly back into repayment, including by improving student loan servicing. ""Since Day One of this Administration, the Department has focused on supporting students and borrowers throughout the pandemic and ensuring they have the resources they need to return to repayment successfully,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “This additional extension of the repayment pause will provide critical relief to borrowers who continue to face financial hardships as a result of the pandemic, and will allow our Administration to assess the impacts of Omicron on student borrowers. As we prepare for the return to repayment in May, we will continue to provide tools and supports to borrowers so they can enter into the repayment plan that is responsive to their financial situation, such as an income-driven repayment plan. Students and borrowers will always be at the center of our work at the Department, and we are committed to not only ensuring a smooth return to repayment, but also increasing accountability and stronger customer service from our loan servicers as borrowers prepare for repayment.” The pause on student loan payments will help 41 million borrowers save $5 billion per month. Borrowers are encouraged to use the additional time to ensure their contact information is up to date and to consider enrolling in electronic debit and income-driven repayment plans to support a smooth transition to repayment. More information can be found at StudentAid.gov. Today’s action is one of a series of steps the Biden-Harris Administration has taken to support students and borrowers, make higher education more affordable, and improve student loan servicing, including providing nearly $13 billion in targeted loan relief to over 640,000 borrowers. Actions within that include: Revamping the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program in October, which has already provided $2.4 billion in loan relief to 38,000 borrowers. As part of that effort, the Department implemented a Limited PSLF Waiver to count all prior payments made by student borrowers toward PSLF, regardless of the loan program. Borrowers who are working in public service but have not yet applied for PSLF should do so before October 31, 2022, and can find out more at StudentAid.gov/PSLF. Providing $7.0 billion in relief for 401,000 borrowers who have a total and permanent disability. Approving $1.5 billion in borrower defense claims, including extending full relief to approved claims and approving new types of claims. Providing $1.26 billion in closed school discharges to 107,000 borrowers who attended the now-defunct ITT Technical Institute. Helping 30,000 small business owners with student loans seeking help from the Paycheck Protection Program."

The program will award $5 million in grants that will provide financial support to organizations that offer technical assistance and training to state educational agencies and school districts in the implementation of effective family engagement policies, programs, and activities that lead to improvements in student development and academic achievement. As students continue to recover from the pandemic, it is critical that states and districts work in partnership with parents and families to help address the impacts the pandemic has had on children across the country, and that their experiences can help inform how our schools address academic recovery and students’ needs. As part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s broader commitment to ensure parents and families can help inform their children’s education, the American Rescue Plan’s Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) fund requires states and school districts to conduct robust stakeholder engagement around how ESSER funds should be spent – and parents can and should participate in that process. “Parents’ voices are critical to the success of our education system. They are our children’s first, and most influential teachers,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “Our commitment to parent and family engagement and collaboration has been embedded in our work at the U.S. Department of Education since Day One of the Biden-Harris Administration. In fact, meaningful parent engagement in schools has never been more important than now as we work together to support our learners during a pandemic. I’m heartened that these new grants will help support the vital role that parents and families play in nurturing our students’ academic success, mental health needs, and developing critical life skills.” Statewide organizations or consortia in partnership with at least one State Education Agency, are invited to apply for funds to establish Statewide Family Engagement Centers that (1) carry out parent education and family engagement in education programs, and (2) provide comprehensive training and technical assistance to states, districts, and schools identified by states and districts, organizations that support family-school partnerships, and other such programs. The Department will provide up to $5 million for an estimated 5-7 new grants with an estimated first-year grant award of $500,000 to $1 million per grantee. Grantees will receive annual grant funds over a period of five years. Applications for the second round of funding will be due on February 17, 2022. Winners will be selected, and awards will be made by September 2022. Officials from the Department of Education's Office of Elementary and Secondary Education will conduct several webinars for potential applicants. All webinars require participants to register in advance.

It’s encouraging that test-to-stay strategies are proving effective both in limiting transmission of the virus and in ensuring that students can remain learning in school, so that entire classrooms or schools do not have to shut down when a case of COVID-19 is discovered in the school community,” said Secretary Cardona. “All students should be able to access their classrooms five days a week, and strategies from CDC and funding from the American Rescue Plan will help ensure that’s possible. Especially at a time when evidence continues to show the impacts of the pandemic on students’ learning, schools across the country must do everything possible to keep students safe and ensure that they are able to access high-quality, in-person instruction safely in their schools. This work is urgent and necessary so that we can mitigate the effects of unfinished instruction and ensure that our students are set up to succeed.”"

The new Executive Order directs Federal agencies to put people at the center of everything the Government does, and includes 36 customer experience (CX) improvement commitments across 17 Federal agencies, all of which aim to improve people's lives and the delivery of Government services. The Executive Order also creates a sustained, cross-government service delivery process that aligns to the moments that matter most in people's lives. ""The President's Executive Order reinforces and advances one of our core, founding principles as a nation, that we have a government of the people, by the people, and for the people.

""We are attuned to the needs of those we serve—including students, educators, parents and families, and communities. I'm proud of the Education Department's work on behalf of the American people, from supporting states and districts in fully reopening schools for in-person learning; to fighting to ensure that the rights of historically and presently underserved students are protected; to increasing equity and excellence in P-12 education; to improving access, affordability, and success in postsecondary education."" Under the Executive Order, the U.S. Department of Education will ensure that for the 1 in 6 Americans, or approximately 45 million people, who are managing their student loans: 1 Direct Loan borrowers will need to navigate only a single repayment portal on StudentAid.gov, so that they can apply for, manage, and repay their loans without having to visit multiple websites and manage multiple sets of credentials for different aspects of their student loans. Public Service Loan Forgiveness candidates, including civil servants and active-duty service members, will be able to apply for the program with less paperwork than currently and without having to fill out forms with information they have already provided to the Federal government previously.

Today’s approvals mean a total of 49 ARP ESSER state plans have been approved since June. “The Department is committed to working in partnership with your State so that your ARP ESSER funds are quickly put to work to ensure students have sustained access to in-person instruction as well as the comprehensive supports they need to recover fully from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic,” wrote U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona in a letter to Wisconsin’s State Superintendent of Public Instruction Dr. Jill Underly. The distribution of ARP ESSER funds is part of the Department’s broader effort to support students and districts as they work to reengage students impacted by the pandemic, address inequities exacerbated by COVID-19, and build our education system back better than before. In addition to providing $130 billion for K-12 education in the American Rescue Plan to support the safe reopening of K-12 schools and meet the needs of all students, the Biden-Harris Administration also has: Held the Return To School Road Trip , a bus tour that visited schools across five states in five days to celebrate the safe return to school Announced new mental health resources to provide information and resources to enhance the promotion of mental health and the social and emotional well-being among children and students Launched the Return To School Roadmap t o provide key resources and supports for students, parents, educators, and school communities to build excitement around returning to classrooms this school year and outline how federal funding can support the safe and sustained return to in-person learning Released three volumes of the COVID-19 Handbook Hosted a National Safe School Reopening Summit Prioritized the vaccination of educators, school staff and child care workers.

2-Dec-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-launches-two-communities-practice-help-states-address-impact-pandemic-students,U.S. Department of Education Launches Two Communities of Practice to Help States Address Impact of the Pandemic on Students,"Today, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) launched two new multistate communities of practice to support states in addressing the impact of lost instructional time from the pandemic on students’ social, emotional, and mental health, and academic well-being. “Students across the country have felt the impact of school building closures as a result of the pandemic. While the good news is that nearly 100 percent of America’s schools have now returned to in-person instruction, we must provide the necessary supports to nurture all students’ social-emotional well-being, mental health, and positive academic outcomes by addressing the impact of lost instructional time,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “I’m proud that these new communities of practice, supporting the use of American Rescue Plan funds, will help states engage in this vital work.” The Department is launching the Evidence-Based Interventions: Using American Rescue Plan Resources to Accelerate Learning Community of Practice with the National Comprehensive Center. This community of practice will work with states and communities in accelerating learning using American Rescue Plan (ARP) funding in sustainable ways. The Department will invite teams of State Educational Agencies (SEAs), Local Education Agencies (LEAs), and partner community-based organizations (CBOs) to participate in the community of practice. Participants will explore different evidence-based strategies to accelerate learning and build their organizational capacity to support districts and schools in implementing these practices with fidelity, using the ARP Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) funds for evidence-based interventions such as high-dosage tutoring and expanded learning time. This community of practice will address students' needs by equipping local educators, school staff, partners, and leaders with the skills they need to design and deploy interventions that work for all students to recover lost instructional time, with a focus on students most impacted by the pandemic. The Department is also launching the Toward an Equitable Education and Recovery: Transforming Kindergarten Community of Practice in partnership with the Campaign for Grade Level Reading and the Department’s T4PA Center , among other partners. This community of practice will engage a cohort of state and district teams to share best practices, policies, and initiatives that will allow the kindergarten year to become a more effective path to early school success and learning recovery, especially for those children who have been historically underserved and most adversely affected by the ongoing pandemic. The community of practice will consist of a series of virtual convenings on topics such as social-emotional development, family engagement and supportive transitions that respond to disparities in access to in-person learning and nationwide under-enrollment for young children. In addition, the Department will continue to support states who participated in the Summer Learning and Enrichment Collaborative (SLEC) through the Strategic Use of Summer and Afterschool Set-Asides Community of Practice . This series will support state teams and their partners in promoting strategic and sustainable use of ARP funding to accelerate learning through summer and out of school time programming. This community of practice will build on the success from the SLEC, which brought together 49 State Education Agencies across eight total events that reached more than 1,300 participants. The communities of practice are the Department’s most recent efforts to support families by addressing the impact of lost instructional time. This fall, the Department released “ Strategies for Using American Rescue Plan Funding to Address the Impact of Lost Instructional Time ,” a resource to support educators as they implement, refine, and work to continuously improve their strategies for supporting students."

Washington's plan details how the state is using and plans to use ARP ESSER funds to sustain the safe operation of schools and equitably expand opportunity for students who need it most, particularly those most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. As students and states returned to school, the Department released the Return To School Roadmap , which provides key resources and supports for students, parents, educators, and school communities to build excitement around returning to classrooms this school year and outlines how federal funding can support the safe and sustained return to in-person learning. ARP funds can be used to support students and educators as they recover from lost instructional time, including in ways outlined on the Roadmap. Earlier this year, the Department distributed two-thirds of the ARP ESSER funds, totaling $81 billion, to 50 states and the District of Columbia. The remaining third of the funding to states will be made available once state plans are approved. Washington is receiving $1.8 billion total in ARP ESSER funds, and today’s approval of their plan will result in the release of the final $618 million. Today’s approval mean a total of 48 ARP ESSER state plans have been approved since June. “I am excited to announce approval of Washington's plan and thank Chair Murray for her continued partnership working on behalf of our school communities,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “It is heartening to see, reflected in these state plans, the ways in which states are thinking deeply about how to use American Rescue Plan funds to continue to provide critical support to schools and communities. The approval of these plans enables states to receive vital, additional American Rescue Plan funds to help keep schools open for full-time, in-person learning; meet students’ academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs; and address disparities in access to educational opportunity that were exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. The state plans that have been submitted to the Department lay the groundwork for the ways in which an unprecedented infusion of federal resources will be used to address the urgent needs of America’s children and build back better.” “I am proud of the work our schools are doing to support our students’ well-being and in-person learning recovery and acceleration,” said Washington Superintendent of Public Instruction Chris Reykdal. “As a state, every decision we’ve made has centered our students. Nearly 90% of our school employees are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, our students are learning in-person full-time, and our educators are working incredibly hard to support our students as we emerge through this pandemic. I am grateful for the investments made by the federal and our state governments, which have provided our schools with the support they critically need during this unprecedented time.” “Since the start of the pandemic, I’ve been laser-focused on getting Washington state students—and students across the country—back in the classroom safely as quickly as possible, with their friends, coaches, counselors and teachers, because I know how important that is for their learning. That’s why we worked so hard to pass the American Rescue Plan—to provide schools the resources they need to re-open safely, address learning loss, provide mental health resources, and provide masks, tests, and improved ventilation,” said Senator Patty Murray (D-WA). “I’ve talked to parents, educators, and students across the state and I know what a difference being in the classroom makes. Having the Washington state plan approved is an important step to ensure our state can use these resources, but the disruptions in learning we’re still seeing are absolutely unacceptable. Getting our students back in the classroom safely is just step one—now we need to focus on keeping them there. So I’m going to be monitoring closely to make sure these resources are used carefully to help students recover from these incredibly tough years, and keep them safe and in the classroom."" The ARP ESSER state plans approved by the Department, including Washington's, show how states are using Federal pandemic resources to support safe in-person instruction and meet the social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs of students—with a focus on the students most impacted by the pandemic. For example: Addressing the Academic Impact of Lost Instructional Time: The Washington State Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) grants will provide schools with resources to adopt universal screening and provide individualized evidence-based instruction to increase student engagement, content mastery, credit attainment, and graduation rates, particularly for students most impacted by the pandemic. Additional investments of the State set-aside include programs to improve mathematics and literacy instruction, youth reengagement and outreach efforts, expanding access to Native education curriculum, and support for students in the foster care system. Investing in Expanded Afterschool Programs: OSPI will use a targeted grant award process to allocate ARP ESSER funds to existing afterschool 21st Century Community Learning Center programs, particularly to address the disproportionate impact of the COVID pandemic on particular student groups. Prior to funding, OSPI will review programs’ implementation of evidence-based afterschool programming, expansion of services to new sites, and communities not currently served. Supporting Students’ Social, Emotional, and Mental Health Needs: OSPI will fund the Social Emotional Learning Professional Learning Network and Mitigating Effects of Intergenerational Trauma initiative to focus on the specific needs of American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) children, youth, and families, and to strengthen understanding of social-emotional learning efforts. Additionally, OSPI will fund integrated content and evidence-based instructional strategies which will provide integrated instruction using social emotional learning, trauma-informed and culturally responsive pedagogical strategies integrated across content areas. The distribution of ARP ESSER funds is part of the Department’s broader effort to support students and districts as they work to reengage students impacted by the pandemic, address inequities exacerbated by COVID-19, and build our education system back better than before. In addition to providing $130 billion for K-12 education in the American Rescue Plan to support the safe reopening of K-12 schools and meet the needs of all students, the Biden-Harris Administration also has: Held the Return To School Road Trip , a bus tour that visited schools across five states in five days to celebrate the safe return to school.

By implementing the approved ARP-OA implementation plan, all public and non-public schools will be able to extend supportive learning opportunities, employ social-emotional learning to address the effects of the pandemic, and mitigate the threat of the spread of the disease. We extend our appreciation and gratitude to USED for their approval of the ASDOE plan to support our students. In moving forward, the ASDOE’s ARP action plan will empower our students to work collaboratively with school leaders and staff, community members, and their peers to address the challenges of the pandemic together. Lastly, I want to recognize our Federal Grants Office team for the tremendous work in diligently completing, revising, and finalizing the ASDOE’s implementation plan.” The implementation plan approved by the Department today outlines how federal pandemic funds are supporting safe, in-person instruction and the social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs of students—with a focus on the students most impacted by the pandemic. For example: Returning to In - Person Learning in 2021: ASDOE will undertake several improvement projects to prepare school facilities to maximize the number of students schools are able to serve. Through the Early Childhood Education (ECE) Playground Center Project, ASDOE seeks to develop outdoor play areas/playgrounds for ECE centers to promote social distancing and encourage outdoor play and ensure the accessibility of playgrounds and/or outdoor play areas for children with special needs. The ECE and Elementary Libraries Projects will ensure that all ECE centers are equipped with mini libraries. All elementary school libraries will undergo renovations and improvements, which include updated books and resources. Through the School Cafeteria Infrastructure Implementation Project, ASDOE will improve the infrastructure of all school site cafeterias to accommodate the needs of students and to ensure the health and safety of all those in the school community. Addressing the Academic Impact of Lost Instructional Time: ASDOE will invest in online and computer-based resources to support classroom instruction. Secondary school students will benefit from the use of math resources, through online programs, during the regular school day, after school, and summer school. Staff will receive training to support students in using these programs. Investing in Summer Learning and Expanded Afterschool Programs: ASDOE is committed to preparing its students for careers and education after high school. ASDOE will use a portion of ARP funding to support a number of career and technical trade programs for elementary through high school students. Programs will expose students to careers in fields such as robotics, electricity, woodworking, farming, drafting, auto body and welding, basic sewing, and basic cooking. The ARP-OA SEA Fund, authorized under Section 2005 of the ARP Act of 2021, provides $850 million for the Secretary of Education to allocate to the Outlying Areas (American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands)based on their respective needs. The Secretary allocated these funds to support safely reopening and sustaining safe operations of schools while meeting the academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs of students resulting from the pandemic.

Furthermore, the funds have been central to us closing the digital divide by establishing and expanding our technological infrastructure, allowing for the purchase of laptops and internet access for all Virgin Islands students. While these times have undoubtedly been challenging, they have also brought about great opportunity. We remain grateful for the support U.S. Department of Education continues to provide.” “The American Rescue Plan provides $138 million to the Virgin Islands to help K-12 schools take the steps recommended by the CDC to ensure students and educators can return to the classroom safely,” said Rep. Stacey E. Plaskett. “The success of our educational system is important to the success of our students and to the strength of our community. The American Rescue Plan makes a historic investment that will secure the future of educational institutions and provides struggling students with urgent relief that will allow them to stay on track and complete their education. I am proud that we were able to deliver this support for our educational system and I applaud the Biden-Harris Administration for its relentless focus on defeating the pandemic and building back a better economy.” The implementation plan approved by the Department today outlines how federal pandemic funds are supporting safe, in-person instruction and the social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs of students—with a focus on the students most impacted by the pandemic. For example: Returning to In - Person Learning in 2021: The St. Thomas/St. John School District of the U.S. Virgin Islands seeks to implement a multi-tiered comprehensive program that positively impacts the social and emotional development, and academic learning, as well as the physical and mental well-being, of students in all subgroups.

The American Rescue Plan Act’s American Indian Resilience in Education (AIRE) grant program will fund culturally relevant projects—that include at least one of the activities from section 6121(c) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965—designed to assist and encourage Native American children and youth to enter, remain in, or reenter school at any grade level from Pre-K through grade 12. These activities include a broad range of direct education, health, and workforce preparation services for Native students, their teachers, and their families. “The Department of Education is committed to advancing equity and excellence for Native American students,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “The ARP AIRE funds will be critical in helping Tribal Educational Agencies bring students back to engaging and culturally responsive in-person learning. These resources will support the efforts of Tribal leaders to improve educational opportunities and outcomes for Native children and youth; honor Tribal traditions, cultures and languages; and elevate the deep reserves of knowledge and expertise in these communities.” The AIRE grant program is a one-time discretionary grant competition authorized under the American Rescue Plan Act to provide awards to TEAs for activities authorized under section 6121(c) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Funding is being awarded to 15 TEAs, including for the following projects: The Seneca Nation of Indians in New York will use funds to support the Literacy Language Culture Project, which will assist Seneca children to enter, remain in, and reenter school by advancing the inclusion of Seneca language, literacy, and culture in school activities. (Award amount $482,172) The Pinoleville Pomo Nation ARP-AIRE Project in Oregon will provide special health and nutrition services and other related activities, that address the special health, social, and mental health needs facing Native youth in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. (Award amount $399,999) The Kenaitze Indian Tribe in Alaska will use funds to connect Native youth with cultural, academic, and community support networks to remove barriers facing Native families to access and utilize school services. (Award amount $372,436) The Department advanced its commitment to engage in regular and meaningful consultation and collaboration by conducting a virtual Tribal consultation session regarding the AIRE program on April 26, 2021. Consistent with the Department’s trust responsibility to Tribes and its Tribal consultation policy, the Department consulted with elected officials of Tribal Nations to ensure that their views inform the Department’s policy decisions related to the priorities, requirements, and definitions that govern this competition.

Puerto Rico’s plan details how they are using and plan to use ARP ESSER funds to sustain the safe operation of schools and equitably expand opportunity for students who need it most, particularly those most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. As students and states return to school, the Department released the Return To School Roadmap , which provides key resources and supports for students, parents, educators, and school communities to build excitement around returning to classrooms this school year and outlines how federal funding can support the safe and sustained return to in-person learning. ARP funds can be used to support the Roadmap’s efforts. Earlier this year, the Department distributed two-thirds of the ARP ESSER funds, totaling $81 billion, to state education agencies. The remaining third of the funding will be made available once state plans are approved. Puerto Rico is receiving nearly $3 billion total in ARP ESSER funds, and today’s approval of their plan will result in the release of the final $990 million. Today’s approval means a total of 47 ARP ESSER state plans have been approved since June. “I am excited to announce approval of Puerto Rico’s plan,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “It is heartening to see, reflected in these plans, the ways in which educators are thinking deeply about how to use American Rescue Plan funds to continue to provide critical support to schools and communities. The approval of these plans enables states to receive vital, additional American Rescue Plan funds to help keep schools open for full-time, in-person learning; meet students’ academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs; and address disparities in access to educational opportunity that were exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. The plans that have been submitted to the Department lay the groundwork for the ways in which an unprecedented infusion of federal resources will be used to address the urgent needs of America’s children and build back better.” “For the past five years, Puerto Rico’s educational system has been affected by natural disasters and, like the entire nation, by the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Designated Secretary of the Puerto Rico Department of Education Eliezer Ramos Pàres. “These issues have led us to rethink what we do every day and develop a new education model that innovates to truly support all of our students. The unique opportunity that these funds present promises to empower school directors, teachers, parents, and, most importantly, students. We are doing strategic investments that will have long-term benefits for our students and education communities.” The ARP ESSER state plans approved by the Department, including Puerto Rico’s, show how states are using federal pandemic resources to support safe, in-person instruction and meet the social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs of students—with a focus on the students most impacted by the pandemic. For example: Safely Reopening Schools and Sustaining Safe Operations: In collaboration with the Puerto Rico Department of Health (PRDH), the Puerto Rico Department of Education (PRDE) has conducted three vaccination campaigns designed to increase vaccine awareness and trust. Vaccination is mandatory for educators and staff in public schools. As of September 2021, more than 96% of school personnel was vaccinated, more than 75% of students ages 12 through 15 years were vaccinated, and more than 85% of students 16 years or older were vaccinated. Furthermore, in September 2021, a collaboration agreement was formalized between PRDE, the Puerto Rico Department of Health, and VocesPR to promote the vaccination of students 12 years or older, through the initiative Vacu Tour Back to School. Additionally, the PRDH developed a vaccination plan to provide the vaccination through phases. Phase I included the pediatricians, hospitals, and pharmacies achieving the vaccination of more than 20,000 children. Phase II starts later this fall and is called the Vacu Tour Kids. Vaccination clinics will be coordinated between the PRDH authorized providers and school directors. Addressing the Academic Impact of Lost Instructional Time: PRDE will use ARP ESSER funds to expand and extend tutoring services provided by the University of Puerto Rico (UPR), prioritizing students with disabilities among other groups of students most impacted by the pandemic. The Professional Development and University Relationship Institute, in collaboration with UPR, is offering tutoring services for students from the 3rd and 12th grades. PRDE plans to expand these services to all students and extend the tutoring program through 2024. Supporting the Educator Workforce: PRDE has identified multiple shortages in the educator workforce. PRDE plans to use ARP ESSER funds to further compensate staff as a retention strategy. These strategies include, but are not limited to, improving school environments; providing needed academic resources, materials, and equipment; providing stipends; recruiting necessary school and Regional Education Office staff who support teachers; providing internships; offering professional development with credit hours, including specialized professional development to support teachers; and targeting support related to accelerated learning. The distribution of ARP ESSER funds is part of the Department’s broader effort to support students and districts as they work to reengage students impacted by the pandemic, address inequities exacerbated by COVID-19, and build our education system back better than before. In addition to providing $130 billion for K-12 education in the American Rescue Plan to support the safe reopening of K-12 schools and meet the needs of all students, the Biden-Harris Administration also has: Held the Return To School Road Trip , a bus tour that visited schools across five states in five days to celebrate the safe return to school. Announced new mental health resources to provide information and resources to enhance the promotion of mental health and the social and emotional well-being among children and students Launched the Return To School Roadmap to provide key resources and supports for students, parents, educators, and school communities to build excitement around returning to classrooms this school year and outline how federal funding can support the safe and sustained return to in-person learning. Released three volumes of the COVID-19 Handbook. Hosted a National Safe School Reopening Summit . Announced a new grant program to provide additional funding to school districts that have been financially penalized for implementing strategies to prevent the spread of COVID-19, such as universal indoor masking. Prioritized the vaccination of educators, school staff, and childcare workers. Provided $10 billion in funding for COVID-19 testing for preK-12 educators, staff, and students. Launched a series of equity summits focused on addressing inequities that existed before but were made worse by the pandemic. Released a report on the disparate impacts of COVID-19 on underserved communities. Developed a Safer Schools and Campuses Best Practices Clearinghouse elevating hundreds of best practices to support schools’ efforts to reopen safely and address the impacts of COVID-19 on students, educators, and communities. In addition to the actions the Biden Administration has taken to reopen schools, the President has proposed critical investments through his Build Back Better Agenda. The Build Back Better agenda will offer universal and free preschool for all 3- and 4-year-olds, make education beyond high school more affordable—including offering more trainings and apprenticeships, increasing the maximum Pell Grants, expanding access to DREAMers, and making historic investments in Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal Colleges and Universities, and minority-serving institutions, among other provisions."

Swiss companies actively invest in U.S. manufacturing and directly support more than 500,000 U.S. jobs, with an average annual salary of $101,800. The signing took place at the Department of Labor's Frances Perkins Building as the nation marks the 7th annual National Apprenticeship Week , Nov. 15-21. The weeklong celebration allows labor and business leaders, educational institutions, career seekers, and other partners to demonstrate support for apprenticeships in preparing a highly skilled, diverse workforce to meet the talent needs of employers and train Americans for good-paying jobs across multiple industries. ""I'm proud that the Department of Education and our partners across the Biden Administration are committed to ensuring that all Americans, especially those in historically underserved and marginalized communities, have the right skills to reemerge from the pandemic stronger than ever,"" said Secretary Cardona. ""The $122 billion American Rescue Plan Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund gives America's high school students a path to rewarding and high-paying careers through work-based learning and career and technical education, and this partnership will allow more students to benefit from these opportunities."" Specifically, the MOU will promote the exchange of ideas and best practices for expanding apprenticeship programs in both countries. Similar memoranda have bolstered U.S. efforts to establish new apprenticeship programs, increase awareness of opportunities, and create career pathways for Registered Apprentices. ""Registered apprenticeships are a proven learn-while-you-earn model and path to good paying, middle-class jobs,"" said Secretary Walsh. ""Swiss-owned businesses have long demonstrated the value of this approach and with greater engagement with Switzerland and other partners, we can increase foreign investment in the U.S. and expand opportunities for American workers."""

The package describes key civil rights data OCR intends to collect from the nation's public schools and districts. OCR plans to introduce new data categories, such as those relating to students' educational experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic and restore key data categories from previous collections. The Department has collected civil rights data since 1968. The CRDC collects data and information about student access to educational courses and school staff, as well as school climate factors, such as the use of student discipline and incidents of student harassment, from schools serving students in preschool to grade 12. ""The Civil Rights Data Collection provides crucial information for evaluating students' experiences in America's public schools. Especially given the COVID-19 pandemic, today's announcement of proposed data elements for the 2021-22 collection comes at a critical moment,"" said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon. ""We look forward to receiving and reviewing public comments on the proposed data elements and to working with schools and districts to collect these essential data."" Today's Information Collection Request package includes key proposed data elements for the 2021-22 CRDC, which were informed by listening sessions with stakeholders. These data include: The addition of COVID-19 data elements to learn the extent to which schools are offering remote and/or in-person instruction to students during the school year. Revisions to the restraint and seclusion definitions. The restoration and expansion of data about preschool students and teachers, including data elements regarding preschool students with disabilities who receive special education and related services and those who are English Learners; the extent to which schools have teachers with one or two years of experience; and teacher certification status. And, The addition of a nonbinary option to male/female data categories for those schools and districts that already collect that data, to ensure the CRDC captures accurate and inclusive information about all student identities and student experiences, where the data are available. In August 2021, OCR announced the administration of a 2021-22 CRDC, marking the first time that OCR has conducted a civil rights data collection two years in a row for the 2020-21 and 2021-22 school years. The additional collection will allow the Department to identify and address inequities in educational opportunities as the country continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on students' academic, social, and emotional development. Ongoing civil rights data about student experiences will assist the Department and school officials with assessing the initial impacts of the substantial increase in federal funding to schools and districts to ensure students received equitable access to instruction and other activities during the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2021-22 CRDC will also advance OCR's mission to ensure that schools and districts receiving financial assistance from the Department do not discriminate based on race, color, national origin, sex or disability. The CRDC is a valuable resource for all those who use data to better inform decisions concerning student equity and opportunity. For background information and FAQs regarding the CRDC, please visit: Frequently Asked Questions . Members of the public may review the proposed 2021-22 CRDC data elements here . An official copy will be posted in the Federal Register at https://www.federalregister.gov by Nov. 19, 2021. Interested persons will have 60 days to submit comments."
15-Nov-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/departments-interior-education-and-health-human-services-launch-multi-agency-initiative-protect-and-preserve-native-languages,"Departments of the Interior, Education, and Health & Human Services Launch Multi-Agency Initiative to Protect and Preserve Native Languages","The U.S. Departments of the Interior, Education and Health and Human Services launched a new interagency initiative today to preserve, protect, and promote the rights and freedom of Native Americans to use, practice, and develop Native languages. The announcement was made as part of the 2021 White House Tribal Nations Summit, which brings government officials and leaders from federally recognized Tribes together to discuss ways the federal government can invest in and continue to strengthen the nation-to-nation relationship and ensure that progress in Indian Country endures for years to come. The three agencies joined five others in signing a memorandum of agreement (MOA) to further the Native American Languages Act of 1990 by establishing new goals and programs that support the protection and preservation of Native languages spoken by federally recognized American Indian and Alaska Native Tribes, Native Hawaiians, and other Native American groups in the United States. The MOA reaffirms the establishment of an annual national summit on Native languages, which will take place this year on November 18-19, 2021. “The cornerstone of any culture or community is its language. Languages are where oral histories are passed down, knowledge is shared, and bonds are formed. As part of our commitment to strengthening and supporting Indigenous communities, the Interior Department is resolute in its efforts to ensuring Native languages are preserved and protected,” said Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland. “From our libraries and schools to museums and cultural centers, the Department is proud to help lead this interagency effort to encourage programs and projects to include instruction in and preservation of Native languages.” “The Department of Education is committed to advancing equity and excellence in our nation’s education system for Native American students to fulfill our commitment to furthering Tribal sovereignty and self-determination. A vital part of that work entails ensuring that the cultural and linguistic identities of Native American students are affirmed in school,” said Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “Native American languages connect to a delicate and meaningful balance with belief systems and treasured heritage. And as I’ve learned in speaking with Tribes, these belief systems, in turn, provide a way of understanding and connecting to the past, present, and future through Native American values that have been transferred over generations. For all these reasons, I’m proud that the Biden administration is committed to supporting the preservation and revitalization of Native languages.” “Preserving Native languages, at a time when many communities have lost a great many linguistic experts, is critical. Throughout the pandemic, many people have not been able to practice or access cultural resources due to a high risk of COVID-19 infection,” said Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra. “Many ceremonies and healing practices that are typically conducted in Native American languages have been paused for almost two years. In certain Native communities, language is at risk of being lost altogether. Investing in linguistics is key to supporting our tribal communities and protecting their history, and today’s investment should help achieve this important goal.” For more than 150 years, Native languages in the U.S. have been subjected to suppression and elimination from a variety of factors such as federal boarding and other types of schools that forced American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian children to forgo speaking the language of their peoples. Additional signatory agencies include the U.S. Departments of Agriculture, Transportation, Institute of Museum and Library Services, the Library of Congress, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the National Endowment for the Humanities. Native language preservation has for many years been cited by Indigenous leaders as important to their self-preservation, self-determination and sovereignty. Native preservation and language revitalization is a critical priority because languages go to the heart of a Tribe’s unique cultural identities, traditions, spiritual beliefs, and self-governance. Native languages are not simply collections of words nor are they interchangeable with one another. Even within their languages, a variety of dialects can be spoken. These themes were recently re-emphasized in Tribal consultations and through listening and learning sessions conducted by the Biden-Harris administration that identified barriers, challenges and needs regarding Native language preservation. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted another serious threat to Native languages: the loss of Tribal elders, who are bearers of their Tribe’s culture, traditions, and history, and fluent speakers of its language. The MOA includes specific interagency goals, including, but not limited to: Identifying statutory or regulatory barriers that impede federal implementation of Native language activities; Identifying research that explores educational attainment and Native language retention and/or revitalization; Simplifying the process to integrate Native language instruction and language and other cultural activities into educational settings, including libraries, museums, cultural and historic preservation programs, and in the arts; and Strengthening Tribal consultations on the issue of Native languages. To further the goals set out in the MOA, the agreement further supports the Native Language Workgroup (NLW) comprised of senior officials from ED, HHS, and DOI’s Bureau of Indian Education (BIE). The NLW will be chaired by the executive director of the White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity for Native Americans and Strengthening Tribal Colleges and Universities , the commissioner of the Administration for Native Americans within HHS, and the director of the BIE."

This nomination shows a deep commitment from this administration to ensure our nation’s students with disabilities receive the services and supports they need to reach their potential. Glenna brings decades of deep expertise in special education and a strong record of supporting students with disabilities to this role. During her work in Washington state as the assistant superintendent of special education, Glenna oversaw millions of dollars for state special education programs and worked to ensure these programs adequately supported and uplifted students with disabilities. Glenna’s commitment to supporting the special education community will be instrumental in shaping and implementing the Department's goals and strategies. I am thankful for her willingness to serve our nation."" About Glenna Gallo Glenna Gallo has served as the assistant superintendent of special education in the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) in Washington since 2017. Prior to that, she spent seven years as the state director of special education for the Utah State Board of Education (USBE), following work as a classroom teacher and administrator. She has over 25 years of public education experience supporting students with disabilities and adults entering and within the teaching profession, and 16 years of experience in state-level educational leadership with expertise in the improvement planning, data analysis, and monitoring of public prek-12+ special education programs. Glenna has Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in special education, special education teacher and administrative licenses, endorsements as a program administrator, principal, and superintendent, and a Master of Business Administration. During her work in Washington state, special education programs were allocated an additional $155 million for state special education programs, $37 million for improvement of statewide inclusionary practices, $12 million for paraeducator training, and $60,000 to reduce the use of restraint and isolation. During her tenure, the historical state special education funding allocation formula was revised to a two-tier system that supports inclusionary practices, and the state high-needs risk pool process was also revised to reduce administrative burden on school districts. Collaboration is a priority for her work, and collaborative efforts were infused within all state efforts regarding students with disabilities. Glenna feels strongly that application of the intent of IDEA requirements results in increased student outcomes for students with disabilities. She works with school and district administrators, special education staff, advocates, parents and families of students with disabilities at the local, state, and national levels to review research, current student achievement data, stakeholder feedback, and compliance data to ensure state and local efforts are addressing instructional issues that impact results for students with disabilities."

The district entered a voluntary agreement to take steps necessary to ensure students with disabilities receive the free appropriate public education (FAPE) to which they are entitled without unnecessary restraint or seclusion or reducing their school days. The agreement calls for identifying ways to minimize the involvement of a school resource officer in student misconduct that can be safely and appropriately handled by school personnel. In addition, the agreement includes a requirement to report accurate data to the Department as part of the Civil Rights Data Collection . ""I thank Saco Public Schools for its leadership in addressing crucial issues for students with disabilities, ensuring that these students will learn in the full school day with appropriate supports from trained school personnel and for the commitment to ensure accurate and complete data reporting to the Office for Civil Rights,"" said Catherine E. Lhamon, assistant secretary for civil rights. ""Saco Public Schools' important actions — including through focusing on de-escalation practices and using less restrictive responses to students — during the course of this review have already contributed to a notable decline in the use of restraint and seclusion while maintaining safe and appropriate learning environments for students."" OCR reviewed Saco Public Schools as part of a series of 24 compliance reviews initiated nationwide related to restraint and seclusion, begun in January 2019. OCR's investigation reflected significant concerns, including elevated use of restraint and seclusion in the first of three school years OCR reviewed, followed by a more than 80% reduction in their use in the second year OCR reviewed and an additional 33% decline the following school year. These reductions, accompanied by changed practices in the district, reflect district capacity to address student civil rights, as does the Saco Public Schools' commitment in its voluntary agreement with OCR to, for example: Assess whether specified students with disabilities who were subjected to restraint or seclusion during the three-year period reviewed require additional remedies or services, including compensatory education. Develop or revise criteria to guide decisions about when Saco Public Schools may need to assess a student's current interventions and supports. Assess the appropriate involvement of a school resource officer in student behavior incidents and provide school resource officer training including specifically about responding to students with disabilities. Develop or revise policy regarding non-disciplinary behavior-related dismissals or stay-home directives to ensure students do not unnecessarily lose instructional time. And, Provide training regarding federal civil rights legal protections for students with disabilities to all district administrators and staff who interact with students.

California’s plan details how the state is using and plans to use ARP ESSER funds to sustain the safe operation of schools and equitably expand opportunity for students who need it most, particularly those most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. As students and states return to school, the Department released the Return To School Roadmap , which provides key resources and supports for students, parents, educators, and school communities to build excitement around returning to classrooms this school year and outlines how federal funding can support the safe and sustained return to in-person learning. ARP funds can be used to support the roadmap’s efforts. Earlier this year, the Department distributed two-thirds of the ARP ESSER funds, totaling $81 billion, to 50 states and the District of Columbia. The remaining third of the funding to states will be made available once state plans are approved. California is receiving $15 billion total in ARP ESSER funds, and today’s approval of their plan will result in the release of the final $5 billion. Additionally, the Department approved Colorado’s state plan. Today’s approvals mean a total of 46 ARP ESSER state plans have been approved since June. “I am excited to announce approval of California’s plan,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “It is heartening to see, reflected in these state plans, the ways in which states are thinking deeply about how to use American Rescue Plan funds to continue to provide critical support to schools and communities.

Newsom’s administration, the California Department of Education, the state Legislature, teachers, administrators and equity advocates. This united front will help us meet the challenge of accelerating learning and supporting all students as we move forward.” “The COVID-19 pandemic caused significant setbacks for California schools, but thanks to the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Funding in the American Rescue Plan, students will soon be able to receive the support and resources they need to confront potential learning loss and thrive in an environment that prioritizes their success,” said Rep. Mark Takano. “As a former public-school teacher for 24 years, I know how important a quality education is, and I’m thrilled that the Biden-Harris Administration worked with Congress to secure funding to provide mental health services, repair facilities, purchase technology to bridge the digital divide, and better respond to the ongoing threat of COVID-19. I am hopeful that we are now on the right track to address the challenges of the past several months.” The ARP ESSER state plans approved by the Department today, including California’s, show how states are using federal pandemic resources to support safe, in-person instruction and meet the social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs of students—with a focus on the students most impacted by the pandemic. For example: Returning to In-Person Learning in 2021: By statute, all schools are required to offer in-person instruction in 2021-22. This fall, the vast majority of districts are serving 95-100% of students in-person, and nearly 98% of schools are expanding mental health, after-school and tutoring programs.< Safely Reopening Schools and Sustaining Safe Operations: In California, there have been more than 3,100 school-located clinics representing over 2 million students. Another 800 clinics are planned for November and December representing over 450,000 students. Additionally, the state has brokered partnerships with after-school programs to hold 84 pop-up clinics across the state and has worked with pediatricians to make sure providers have vaccines on hand. To assist in educating and engaging the public, California has worked to create communications toolkits for schools and youth. The Vaccinate 58 campaign is working to keep the public informed on ongoing vaccination efforts and information. The California Department of Education (CDE), in partnership with the California Department of Public Health, maintains the Shots for Schools website to provide resources for school-located vaccination against COVID-19. This website prominently features information on how to offer vaccinations for students and how districts can become providers to disseminate vaccines and partner with pharmacies to hold “pop-up” vaccination events. Addressing the Academic Impact of Lost Instructional Time: The CDE will use ARP ESSER funds to support an Expanded Learning Opportunity (ELO) grant program. ELO grants will provide resources for students, including students most impacted by the pandemic, including additional instructional time, tutoring, mental health services, creation of community learning hubs, and additional support for students who do not have enough credits for grade promotion or graduation. The distribution of ARP ESSER funds is part of the Department’s broader effort to support students and districts as they work to re-engage students impacted by the pandemic, address inequities exacerbated by COVID-19, and build our education system back better than before. In addition to providing $130 billion for K-12 education in the American Rescue Plan to support the safe reopening of K-12 schools and meet the needs of all students, the Biden-Harris Administration also has: Held the Return To School Road Trip , a bus tour that visited schools across five states in five days to celebrate the safe return to school. Announced new mental health resources to provide information and resources to enhance the promotion of mental health and the social and emotional well-being among children and students. Launched the Return To School Roadmap to provide key resources and supports for students, parents, educators, and school communities to build excitement around returning to classrooms this school year and outline how federal funding can support the safe and sustained return to in-person learning. Released three volumes of the COVID-19 Handbook. Hosted a National Safe School Reopening Summit . Announced a new grant program to provide additional funding to school districts that have been financially penalized for implementing strategies to prevent the spread of COVID-19, such as universal indoor masking. Prioritized the vaccination of educators, school staff, and childcare workers. Provided $10 billion in funding for COVID-19 testing for preK-12 educators, staff, and students. Launched a series of equity summits focused on addressing inequities that existed before but were made worse by the pandemic. Released a report on the disparate impacts of COVID-19 on underserved communities. Developed a Safer Schools and Campuses Best Practices Clearinghouse elevating hundreds of best practices to support schools’ efforts to reopen safely and address the impacts of COVID-19 on students, educators, and communities. In addition to the actions the Biden Administration has taken to reopen schools, the President has proposed critical investments through his Build Back Better Agenda. The Build Back Better agenda will offer universal and free preschool for all 3- and 4-year-olds, make education beyond high school more affordable—including offering more trainings and apprenticeships, increasing the maximum Pell Grants, expanding access to DREAMers, and making historic investments in Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal Colleges and Universities, and minority-serving institutions, among other provisions."

Colorado’s plan details how the state is using and plans to use ARP ESSER funds to sustain the safe operation of schools and equitably expand opportunity for students who need it most, particularly those most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. As students and states return to school, the Department released the Return To School Roadmap , which provides key resources and supports for students, parents, educators, and school communities to build excitement around returning to classrooms this school year and outlines how federal funding can support the safe and sustained return to in-person learning. ARP funds can be used to support the roadmap’s efforts. Earlier this year, the Department distributed two-thirds of the ARP ESSER funds, totaling $81 billion, to 50 states and the District of Columbia. The remaining third of the funding to states will be made available once state plans are approved. Colorado is receiving $1.1 billion total in ARP ESSER funds, and today’s approval of their plan will result in the release of the final $389 million. Additionally, the Department approved California’s state plan. Today’s approvals mean a total of 46 ARP ESSER state plans have been approved since June. “I am excited to announce approval of Colorado’s plan,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “It is heartening to see, reflected in these state plans, the ways in which states are thinking deeply about how to use American Rescue Plan funds to continue to provide critical support to schools and communities. The approval of these plans enables states to receive vital, additional American Rescue Plan funds to help keep schools open for full-time, in-person learning; meet students’ academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs; and address disparities in access to educational opportunity that were exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. The state plans that have been submitted to the Department lay the groundwork for the ways in which an unprecedented infusion of federal resources will be used to address the urgent needs of America’s children and build back better.” “The ESSER funding is truly a once in a generation investment in the education of Colorado’s students,” said Colorado Commissioner of Education Katy Anthes. “Our goal is to leverage this investment to help our districts and schools meet not only their current needs, but also anticipate and innovate to address future educational needs so we can emerge from the pandemic stronger than ever.” “I’m glad we were able to secure critical resources to support students, teachers, and school leaders in the American Rescue Plan as they have faced challenge after challenge during the COVID-19 crisis,” said U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet. “Now with Colorado’s education plan approved, our state will be able to use almost $390 million to ensure a safe and supportive learning environment for our kids and address the toll the last year took on students, educators, and our communities.” “The COVID-19 pandemic continues to challenge our state’s students,” said Sen. John Hickenlooper. “This American Rescue Plan funding provides critical support for schools to tackle learning loss and improve mental health to help our students get back on track.” “The American Rescue Plan continues to deliver significant aid to our communities, including for our schools, educators and students,” said Rep. Ed Perlmutter. “I’m glad to see the Department of Education approve Colorado’s plan to help our schools continue safe, in-person learning and provide additional support for students and schools most affected by the pandemic.” The ARP ESSER state plans approved by the Department today, including Colorado’s, show how states are using federal pandemic resources to support safe, in-person instruction and meet the social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs of students—with a focus on the students most impacted by the pandemic. For example: Returning to In-Person Learning in 2021 and Safely Reopening Schools and Sustaining Safe Operations: The majority of Colorado schools are offering fully in-person learning for the 2021-2022 school year. To ensure that they are able to do so safely, the Colorado Department of Education (CDE) is in close collaboration with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment to provide information to educators and parents about vaccines for students ages 5-17. Districts have access to communications tools to support COVID-19 vaccine messaging, including social media graphics, sample messages to parents, and an online vaccine-finder. Addressing the Academic Impact of Lost Instructional Time: CDE will use ARP ESSER funds to support high-impact tutoring, increased access to high-quality curricular and instructional materials, professional learning modules, educator workforce recruitment and retention efforts, school improvement grants, supplemental funding to support Native American students and students with disabilities, and career and technical education programs. Engaging Rural Students through Career-Connected Learning : To strengthen student engagement in rural communities, CDE will use ARP ESSER funds to foster collaborations among rural districts to build career-connected learning opportunities. These coalitions will allow districts to establish partnerships that address the career-connected learning needs of their communities by leveraging the work occurring in neighboring districts. The distribution of ARP ESSER funds is part of the Department’s broader effort to support students and districts as they work to re-engage students impacted by the pandemic, address inequities exacerbated by COVID-19, and build our education system back better than before. In addition to providing $130 billion for K-12 education in the American Rescue Plan to support the safe reopening of K-12 schools and meet the needs of all students, the Biden-Harris dministration also has: Held the Return To School Road Trip , a bus tour that visited schools across five states in five days to celebrate the safe return to school.

20-Oct-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/statement-federal-student-aid-chief-operating-officer-rich-cordray-regarding-loan-servicer-contracts,Statement From Federal Student Aid Chief Operating Officer Rich Cordray Regarding Loan Servicer Contracts,"Federal Student Aid (FSA) approved the request for Maximus to assume the Navient loan servicing contract. We are confident this decision is in the best interest of the approximately 5.6 million federal student loan borrowers who will be serviced by Maximus and will provide the stability and high-quality service they deserve. Our confidence in this novation is bolstered by the fact that Maximus will be held to the stronger standards for performance, transparency, and accountability that FSA included in its recent servicer contract extensions. FSA, Navient, and Maximus will communicate directly with borrowers about how this change affects them. FSA will also post specific information for borrowers assigned to Navient on StudentAid.gov. As evidence of our commitment to improving borrowers’ experience with federal student loans, we will make this transition as seamless as possible; borrowers will not lose access to their payment histories or account data, and they will not need to change their current log-in information, automatic payment arrangements, or other borrower-specific details."

18-Oct-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-releases-new-resource-supporting-child-and-student-social-emotional-behavioral-and-mental-health-during-covid-19-era,"U.S. Department of Education Releases New Resource on Supporting Child and Student Social, Emotional, Behavioral and Mental Health during COVID-19 Era","Today, the U.S. Department of Education released a new resource: Supporting Child and Student Social, Emotional, Behavioral and Mental Health to provide information and resources to enhance the promotion of mental health and the social and emotional well-being among children and students. This resource highlights seven key challenges to providing school- or program-based mental health support across early childhood, K–12 schools, and higher education settings, and presents seven corresponding recommendations. This resource includes many real-world examples of how the recommendations are being put into action by schools, communities, and states across the country. State Education Agencies and local school districts can use the resources in the American Rescue Plan's Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief program (ARP ESSER), as well as previous rounds of ESSER funds, to implement these recommendations and ensure students receive the support they need. Through ARP ESSER alone, state and local education leaders have $122 billion available to them to ensure the mental health, social, emotional and academic needs of our students are met. ""Our efforts as educators must go beyond literacy, math, history, science, and other core subjects to include helping students to build the social, emotional, and behavioral skills they will need to fully access and participate in learning and make the most of their potential and future opportunities,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""Amid the pandemic, we know that our students have experienced so much. We can't unlock students' potential unless we also address the needs they bring with them to the classroom each day. As educators, it's our responsibility to ensure that we are helping to provide students with a strong social and emotional foundation so that they also can excel academically."" More than 18 months into the COVID-19 pandemic, it is particularly important to acknowledge the pandemic's impact on mental health at home and around the world, to present an opportunity for meaningful conversations about mental health, and to celebrate schools and other institutions that have found new and promising ways to provide mental health services to students. This document is part of the Return to School Roadmap , which stresses the importance of supporting students' social, emotional and mental health to create a strong foundation for students' academic success. This resource for educators and practitioners is intended to supplement and build on the information in the prior released ED COVID-19 Handbooks: Volume 1: Strategies for Safely Reopening Elementary and Secondary Schools, Volume 2: Roadmap to Reopening Safely and Meeting All Students' Needs, and Volume 3: Strategies for Safe Operation and Addressing the Impact of COVID-19 on Higher Education Students, Faculty, and Staff, This resource follows World Mental Health Day, earlier this month, as well as last week's announcement of new guidance from the Department and the Department of Justice on Supporting Students at Risk of Self-Harm in the Era of COVID-19 . World Mental Health Day is an international day to raise awareness of mental health issues around the world and to mobilize efforts in support of mental health. The Biden-Harris Administration has taken significant action to address the mental and social emotional health needs of Americans, and the President's Build Back Better agenda includes funding and support for a wide range of programs aimed at improving access to mental health services."
15-Oct-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-increases-servicer-performance-transparency-and-accountability-loan-payments-restart,"U.S. Department of Education Increases Servicer Performance, Transparency, and Accountability Before Loan Payments Restart","The U.S. Department of Education today announced stronger standards for performance, transparency, and accountability for its student loan servicers aimed at protecting borrowers. Six loan servicing companies – Great Lakes, HESC/Edfinancial, MOHELA, Navient, Nelnet, and OSLA Servicing – will be held to these higher standards starting early next year. The new contract terms give the Department’s Federal Student Aid office (FSA) greater ability to monitor and address servicing issues as they arise; require compliance with federal, state, and local laws relating to loan servicing; and hold servicers accountable for their performance, including withholding new loans and associated revenue for poor performance. These changes will be critical as FSA works with student loan servicers to implement the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to reform student loan servicing and ensure a smooth transition for borrowers out of the student loan pause ending on Jan. 31, 2022. “FSA is raising the bar for the level of service student loan borrowers will receive,” said FSA Chief Operating Officer Richard Cordray. “Our actions come at a critical time as we help borrowers prepare for loan payments to resume early next year. The great work done by our negotiating team here enables us to ensure that loan servicers meet the tougher standards or face consequences.” The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 gives FSA the authority to extend the contracts with the loan servicers for up to two more years. Great Lakes, HESC/EdFinancial, MOHELA, Nelnet, and OSLA signed agreements that extend their services to December 2023. Navient also signed a contract extension, although the Department is currently reviewing a recently submitted request from Navient to transfer its contract to Maximus. These extensions were negotiated at no additional cost to taxpayers. The contracts for two current companies – FedLoan Servicing (PHEAA) and Granite State – were not extended; in recent months, these companies announced plans to stop servicing federal student loans, and FSA is in the process of transferring those loans to remaining servicers. Increased Performance Standards to Better Serve Borrowers FSA added new performance standards to the contract extensions, in addition to existing measures tied to servicers’ efforts to keep borrowers from falling behind on their payments. When these new contract terms take effect, federal loan servicers will be measured on four specific ways they interact with borrowers, as well as how effective they are at keeping borrowers from falling behind on their payments. Specifically, FSA will measure loan servicers each quarter on their ability to meet established goals related to: The percentage of borrowers who end a call before reaching a customer service representative by phone. How well customer service representatives answer borrower questions and help them navigate repayment options. Whether servicers process borrower requests accurately the first time. And, The overall level of customer service provided to borrowers. To protect borrowers, FSA will reduce the number of new student loan borrowers assigned in the coming quarter to servicers that fail to meet these stronger performance standards. Servicers that consistently fail to meet these performance standards can be denied new loans. Additionally, servicers will be rewarded for helping borrowers avoid falling behind on their payments, especially at-risk borrowers like recent graduates and borrowers with previously defaulted loans. Student loan servicers will now have strong financial incentives to provide quality service to their customers. When the new contract terms go into effect, FSA will also require servicers to maintain core call center hours, including Saturdays, to make customer service representatives more accessible for borrowers. Further, FSA is requiring loan servicers to increase the number of Spanish-speaking customer service representatives. Increased Accountability to Protect Borrowers FSA is increasing servicers’ accountability to consumers and government entities by requiring all six companies that signed a contract extension to comply with federal, state, and local laws governing loan servicing and to respond to complaints filed with those authorities in a timely manner. Additionally, the contract extensions expressly prohibit loan servicers from shielding themselves from lawsuits brought to hold the companies accountable in court for poor servicing practices. Increased Transparency to FSA and the Public The new contracts address long-standing deficiencies related to servicer transparency by requiring new reporting and greater access for FSA to servicers’ systems and borrower data. Under the new contract terms, FSA will require servicers to provide new, comprehensive reports that give FSA greater insight into borrowers’ experiences with loan servicers. The new reports will allow FSA, for the first time, to properly track why borrowers contact a loan servicer, how long it takes for servicers to process various applications (such as loan forgiveness, deferments, and income-driven repayment), which borrower applications are denied, and what complaints borrowers log directly with servicers. The new contract terms allow FSA to publicly release servicer performance data, beyond just the performance measures used to allocate new loans. Over time, FSA intends to release expanded call center metrics, average processing times, and other key performance metrics. Plans to Reshape the Future of Student Loan Servicing These extensions and new contract terms are only one element of the Biden-Harris Administration’s longer-term effort to improve federal student loan servicing. The changes reflected in the new contract terms will complement short-term changes being made to servicers’ requirements for borrowers’ transition back into repayment on Feb. 1, 2022. Throughout the next year, FSA will take additional steps to implement a broader vision focused on ensuring borrowers have easy access to the clear, accurate, and timely information they need to manage their federal student loans. In addition to building on enhancements to FSA’s digital platform – including StudentAid.gov and the myStudentAid mobile app – the Department will work on a permanent contracting approach to cement greater stability, servicer transparency, accountability, and performance beyond the two-year period authorized by Congress. The Department also will work to standardize borrower data, simplify the process to transfer borrowers from one servicer to another, and improve security and privacy across our systems. Most importantly, we will work to provide borrowers with a superior customer experience and a suite of tools to ensure they have the resources necessary to manage their student loans successfully."

GDOE’s plan details how American Rescue Plan funds will be used to sustain the safe operation of schools and equitably expand opportunity for students who need it most, particularly those most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Department released the Return To School Roadmap , which provides key resources and supports for students, parents, educators, and school communities to build excitement around returning to classrooms this school year and outlines how federal funding can support the safe and sustained return to in-person learning. American Rescue Plan funds can be used to support the Roadmap’s efforts. “I am excited to announce approval of the Guam Department of Education plan,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “It is heartening to see, reflected in these plans, the ways in which education systems are thinking deeply about how to use American Rescue Plan funds to continue to provide critical support to schools and communities. The approval of these plans enables education systems to receive vital, additional American Rescue Plan funds to quickly and safely reopen schools for full-time, in-person learning; meet students’ academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs; and address disparities in access to educational opportunity that were exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. The plans that have been submitted to the Department lay the groundwork for the ways in which an unprecedented infusion of federal resources will be used to address the urgent needs of America’s children and build back better.” “I am pleased to receive the U.S. Department of Education’s approval notification of the $287 million funding from the American Rescue Plan Outlying Areas State Educational Agency,” said Superintendent of Education Jon J.P. Fernandez. “Participating public, charter, and private, non-public schools are eager to implement activities outlined within the approved ARP-OA-SEA Implementation Plan to accelerate student learning and achievement, close learning gaps caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and provide a safe learning environment. With these grant funds, the Guam Department of Education will support the safe return of students to in-person instruction and maintain a safe school environment through the investment of these dollars into the repair and renovation of school campuses. We thank Secretary Cardona and his staff for their review and endorsement of GDOE’s ARP-OA-SEA implementation plan.” The implementation plan approved by the Department today outlines how federal pandemic funds are supporting safe, in-person instruction and the social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs of students—with a focus on the students most impacted by the pandemic. For example: Returning to In-Person Learning in 2021: Capital Improvement Projects – Guided by recommendations from the Department of Interior - Office of Insular Affairs, in partnership with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Initiative Assessment of Buildings and Classrooms, GDOE will undertake several projects to improve and update facilities at multiple schools. These projects will allow GDOE to safely operate all school sites to ensure compliance with health and safety guidelines and allow for the maximum number of in-person student populations. Addressing the Academic Impact of Lost Instructional Time: Classroom Instruction that Works (CITW) Professional Development – Drawing on the research of the widely regarded instructional strategies and resources of CITW, GDOE seeks to accelerate student achievement by preparing teachers to use the most effective approaches to planning, teaching, and assessment using technological resources, such as tablets, laptops, interactive whiteboards, document readers, and virtual and augmented reality setups to support student learning. Investing in Summer Learning and Expanded Afterschool Programs: The Summer Academic Academy (K-8 and High School) – The Summer Academic Academy supports students’ learning recovery from previous COVID-related learning experiences. The approaches to the academic lessons will help provide opportunities to ensure that students are progressing toward grade-level proficiency in the core academic subjects. The Academy provides students an opportunity to address any learning challenges during the school year, based on student grades, faculty recommendations, and parents’/guardians’ requests. The American Rescue Plan Outlying Areas State Educational Agencies Fund, authorized under Section 2005 of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, provides $850 million for the Secretary of Education to allocate to the Outlying Areas (American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) on the basis of their respective needs. The Secretary allocated these funds to support safely reopening and sustaining safe operations of schools while meeting the academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs of students resulting from the pandemic. Today’s approval of the implementation plan is part of the Department’s broader effort to support teachers and other educators as they work to re-engage students impacted by the pandemic, address inequities exacerbated by COVID-19, and build our education system back better than before. In addition to providing $130 billion for K-12 education in the American Rescue Plan to support the safe reopening of K-12 schools and meet the needs of all students, the Biden-Harris Administration also has: Held the Return To School Road Trip , a bus tour that visited schools across five states in five days to celebrate the safe return to school. Launched the Return To School Roadmap t o provide key resources and supports for students, parents, educators, and school communities to build excitement around returning to classrooms this school year and outline how federal funding can support the safe and sustained return to in-person learning. Released three volumes of the COVID-19 Handbook. Hosted a National Safe School Reopening Summit . Announced a new grant program to provide additional funding to school districts that have been financially penalized for implementing strategies to prevent the spread of COVID-19, such as universal indoor masking. Prioritized the vaccination of educators, school staff, and child care workers. Provided $10 billion in funding for COVID-19 testing for pre-K-12 educators, staff, and students. Launched a series of equity summits focused on addressing inequities that existed before but were made worse by the pandemic. Released a report on the disparate impacts of COVID-19 on underserved communities.

Virginia’s plan details how the state is using and plans to use ARP ESSER funds to safely reopen and sustain the safe operation of schools and equitably expand opportunity for students who need it most, particularly those most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. As students and states return to school, the Department released the Return To School Roadmap , which provides key resources and supports for students, parents, educators, and school communities to build excitement around returning to classrooms this school year and outlines how federal funding can support the safe and sustained return to in-person learning. ARP funds can be used to support the roadmap’s efforts. Earlier this year, the Department distributed two-thirds of the ARP ESSER funds, totaling $81 billion, to 50 states and the District of Columbia. The remaining third of the funding to states will be made available once state plans are approved. Virginia is receiving $2.1 billion total in ARP ESSER funds, and today’s approval of their plan will result in the release of the final $704 million. Additionally, the Department approved state plans from Maryland and Nebraska. Today’s approvals mean a total of 44 ARP ESSER state plans have been approved since June. “I am excited to announce approval of Virginia’s plan,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “It is heartening to see, reflected in these state plans, the ways in which states are thinking deeply about how to use American Rescue Plan funds to continue to provide critical support to schools and communities, particularly as we enter the upcoming academic year. The approval of these plans enables states to receive vital, additional American Rescue Plan funds to quickly and safely reopen schools for full-time, in-person learning; meet students’ academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs; and address disparities in access to educational opportunity that were exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. The state plans that have been submitted to the Department lay the groundwork for the ways in which an unprecedented infusion of federal resources will be used to address the urgent needs of America’s children and build back better.” “With Virginia’s students back in classrooms, our schools are eager to implement the resources available in the Commonwealth’s now-approved ARP state plan and put them to work to address unfinished learning,” Superintendent of Public Instruction James Lane said. “These additional federal relief funds will support a wide array of state and local initiatives, ranging from instructional supports focused on literacy and math, to maintaining safe environments for in-person instruction, to providing mental health resources to help our students recover from the pandemic, to recruiting, retaining and supporting our teachers.” “The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an unprecedented disruption in our schools, and students have suffered as a result,” said Sen. Mark Warner. “As students head back to school, I am happy to see that Virginia’s Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief plan has been approved by the Department of Education. These American Rescue Plan funds will provide our educators with the resources they need to help our schools and communities stay safe and recover.” “I’m pleased to see federal funding from the American Rescue Plan go toward helping equip Virginia schools with vital resources to address the impacts of the pandemic on students’ learning,” said Sen. Tim Kaine. “These federal dollars will bolster our schools’ innovative strategies to help students catch up and safely learn in person. As a member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor & Pensions Committee, I will continue working to support schools across the Commonwealth to ensure that our future leaders have the tools they need to reach their full potential.” The ARP ESSER state plans approved by the Department today, including Virginia’s, show how states are using federal pandemic resources to support safe, in-person instruction and meet the social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs of students—with a focus on the students most impacted by the pandemic. For example: Returning to In-Person Learning in 2021: Virginia legislation requires all Virginia public schools to open for all students in-person for the 2021-2022 school year. The only exceptions are temporary building-level closures required by the local health department to contain an outbreak of COVID-19. Addressing the Academic Impact of Lost Instructional Time: The Virginia Department of Education (VDOE) will use some ARP ESSER funding for competitive grants to school districts, grants and agreements with institutions of higher education, and other state-led initiatives. Districts may use these funds to provide support for students, particularly those most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic; to address academic, social-emotional, behavioral, and mental health needs; to reduce class size; to hire tutors and paraprofessionals; to provide literacy and numeracy kits to families; to purchase instructional resources; and for professional development opportunities. Institutions of higher education will participate in initiatives including creating tutoring programs and training educators and community partners. Instructional Staffing to Support Students’ Needs: VDOE is using $11.5 million in ARP ESSER funding to support recruitment efforts for school districts to fill instructional positions between August and November 2021. School districts experiencing the most acute difficulties in recruiting qualified teachers will receive funding priority. The distribution of ARP ESSER funds is part of the Department’s broader effort to support students and districts as they work to re-engage students impacted by the pandemic, address inequities exacerbated by COVID-19, and build our education system back better than before. In addition to providing $130 billion for K-12 education in the American Rescue Plan to support the safe reopening of K-12 schools and meet the needs of all students, the Biden-Harris Administration also has: Held the Return To School Road Trip , a bus tour that visited schools across five states in five days to celebrate the safe return to school. Launched the Return To School Roadmap to provide key resources and supports for students, parents, educators, and school communities to build excitement around returning to classrooms this school year and outline how federal funding can support the safe and sustained return to in-person learning. Released three volumes of the COVID-19 Handbook. Hosted a National Safe School Reopening Summit . Announced a new grant program to provide additional funding to school districts that have been financially penalized for implementing strategies to prevent the spread of COVID-19, such as universal indoor masking. Prioritized the vaccination of educators, school staff, and childcare workers. Provided $10 billion in funding for COVID-19 testing for preK-12 educators, staff, and students. Launched a series of equity summits focused on addressing inequities that existed before but were made worse by the pandemic. Released a report on the disparate impacts of COVID-19 on underserved communities.

We will not accept a return to normal, because normal was not good enough, especially for those who have been historically underserved.” “Team Maryland recognized the urgent need for significant, additional resources to address learning loss for students during the pandemic and worked with the Biden-Harris Administration to provide more than $1.9 billion for Maryland’s public schools through the American Rescue plan,” said Sen. Ben Cardin. “Today’s approval of Maryland’s plan by the U.S. Department of Education means the state and local school districts soon will be better able to support students who have fallen behind, and make targeted investments and improvements in school facilities, enhancing educational programs.” “Our children all must have equal opportunities to succeed in their education. Students and educators in Maryland and across the country have faced unprecedented challenges throughout this pandemic, including a widening learning gap,” said Sen. Chris Van Hollen. “I was proud to help secure these funds within the American Rescue Plan to support our schools, and I am glad to see the Department of Education approve Maryland’s use of these funds in order to ensure that all K-12 students and educators get the support they need to keep students in the classroom and address learning loss. I will continue fighting to increase funding for our education system and to make sure every child in Maryland has access to a quality education.” “The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on young learners across Maryland by exacerbating learning disparities and causing tens of thousands of students to fall behind in their education,” said Rep. Steny Hoyer. “The American Rescue Plan allocated critical funding for schools to help get students back on track by providing essential resources and tools to bridge divides in equity and help meet the needs of students, staff, and our hardworking teachers. I’m so pleased that Maryland’s plan for American Rescue Plan funding has been approved for the academic year ahead. I am hopeful that these resources will continue to ensure all of our students are set up for success.” “Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, my colleagues and I have fought relentlessly for federal resources to keep Maryland communities, teachers and students safe,” said Rep. John Sarbanes. “The Department of Education’s approval of Maryland’s plan today will make available robust American Rescue Plan funding for safe, in-person learning and other long-term priorities such as providing students and teachers with reliable internet access and learning devices, and addressing students’ mental health and academic needs. I am pleased this approval will equip our schools with the tools for a successful academic year.” “In supporting the American Rescue Act, Maryland’s Congressional delegation answered the pleas of our state and local education for more resources to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic and reopen classrooms for in-person learning,” Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger said. “Today’s approval of Maryland’s plan will help enable students and teachers to remain safely in schools and also address the difficult, long-term challenges of helping students make up for lost time in the classroom.” “Every child deserves a quality education, no matter their zip code or circumstances. After unprecedented disruptions to in-classroom instruction, this funding through the American Rescue Plan provides a lifeline for Maryland’s schools to get students and educators safely back in the classroom, address learning loss and achievement gaps while supporting kids during this transition period,” said Rep. Anthony G. Brown. “Our schools are cornerstones of our communities. Together, with the Biden-Harris Administration, we’ll continue to provide them with the resources needed to give students and educators a strong foundation moving forward.” “The pandemic highlighted many inequities in our school districts, especially when it came to broadband access and affordability,” said Rep. David Trone. “So, we had to step up. I’m grateful that we all came together, working side-by-side, to approve historic windfalls of education funding through the American Rescue Plan, including nearly $2 billion for Maryland alone. Today marks another win for America’s education system, and a brighter future for our students.” “The nearly $2 billion in American Rescue Plan funding from the Department of Education for Maryland’s elementary and secondary schools will help close the learning gap exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and will thus help get all of our students back on track,” said Rep. Jamie Raskin. “I will continue to advocate for full investment in Maryland schools as we reopen safely for students, teachers and parents.” The ARP ESSER state plans approved by the Department today, including Maryland’s, show how states are using federal pandemic resources to support safe, in-person instruction and meet the social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs of students—with a focus on the students most impacted by the pandemic. For example: Safely Reopening Schools and Sustaining Safe Operations: The Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE) works closely with the Maryland Department of Health and other state agencies to promote vaccination opportunities for school staff and eligible students. In March 2021, Maryland local school systems reported that more than 97 percent of all eligible staff members (teachers, administrators, and support staff) who had requested a vaccine had been vaccinated. Addressing the Academic Impact of Lost Instructional Time: MSDE will focus on acceleration strategies that support students by providing more time in class, more dedicated attention in class, and exposure to grade-level learning. Most school systems are using a tiered approach to support all students, offering varying levels of support to students based on identified need. Students are identified for the type of support they will receive by school system using data. All funds reserved under this section will be allocated to districts based on the Title I formula. Districts will implement strategies including high-intensity structured tutoring, extended day/year programming, summer school programs, acceleration academies, formative assessments, and early childhood programs. Supporting Students Most Impacted: The MSDE Task Force on Achieving Academic Equity and Excellence for Black Boys has developed several evidence-based recommendations to address the inequities experienced by black boys in eight local education agencies (LEAs) across the state. Grant funding will be allocated to districts to implement the recommendations of the task force’s report, focusing on 1) social-emotional and behavioral supports; 2) recruitment and training of effective teachers and administrators; and 3) curricula and instruction. Examples of evidence-based recommendations include de-escalation and intervention training for all school staff, providing financial incentives to recruit and retain diverse teachers and administrators, and coordinating structured mentoring programs for black boys in grades K-12 with adult males and peers. The distribution of ARP ESSER funds is part of the Department’s broader effort to support students and districts as they work to re-engage students impacted by the pandemic, address inequities exacerbated by COVID-19, and build our education system back better than before.

NDE is also working on a project with a local medical group to promote the safety of vaccines in children. Addressing the Academic Impact of Lost Instructional Time: NDE will pursue evidence-based interventions that support the state plan priorities described above: supporting student and staff social-emotional wellbeing and mental health; reimagining family and community engagement; investing in teacher professional development, upskilling, and the teacher and leader pipeline; and ensuring students have equitable access to grade-level instruction to address unfinished learning and support learning acceleration. Investing in Expanded Afterschool Programs: NDE is partnering with the Nebraska Children and Families Foundation to implement evidence-based enrichment activities. NDE will select sites for funding that have been impacted the most by the COVID-19 pandemic and are most in need.

13-Oct-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/five-board-members-appointed-board-overseeing-nations-report-card,Five Board Members Appointed to Board Overseeing The Nation’s Report Card,"Editor's Note: Former Utah Gov. Gary R. Herbert was appointed Nov. 5 by Secretary Cardona to a four-year term on the National Assessment Governing Board. The 26-member board includes a one Democratic and one Republican governor. Gov. Herbert will fill the position of the Republican governor. Former North Carolina Gov. Beverly Perdue serves as the Democratic governor and the Board's chair. Announcement here . U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona has appointed an elementary school principal, a business executive, a local school board member, a testing and measurement expert, and a former governor to the National Assessment Governing Board , which oversees the only ongoing, nationally representative assessment of what American students know and can do in various subjects. The Governing Board is a nonpartisan body established by Congress in 1988 to oversee and set policy for the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) , also known as “the Nation’s Report Card.” NAEP provides objective information on student performance in various subjects and for different student groups and reports on student achievement across the nation, in states, and in large urban districts. The 26-member Governing Board is responsible for deciding which subjects NAEP assesses, determining the assessments’ content, setting achievement levels that describe student performance, and pursuing new ways to make NAEP results useful and meaningful to the public. Although the Board operates independently, NAEP law calls for members to be appointed by the U.S. Secretary of Education. “It is my pleasure to appoint this distinguished group of leaders to the National Assessment Governing Board,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “As we address students’ educational needs during this challenging time, I'm confident these leaders will bring the perspectives necessary to ensure the National Assessment of Educational Progress remains the gold standard in measuring student academic outcomes. The pandemic has disrupted our students’ educational opportunities and their learning, with impacts on students’ academic and social and emotional development, as well as their mental health. As we work to address students’ academic needs, we need the Nation’s Report Card now more than ever to help us understand students’ academic progress and where additional supports can be targeted, ensuring all students reach their full potential.” The Governing Board appointees announced today include two new Board members and three reappointed members. The appointees’ terms officially began on October 1, 2021, and will end on September 30, 2025, with the exception of the local school board member’s term which will end on September 30, 2024. Secretary Cardona will also appoint a former Republican governor to serve on the Governing Board for the 2021-2025 term later this year. The Governing Board members appointed today and the roles they represent on the Board are: Dana Boyd, Elementary School Principal (reappointed) : Boyd is the principal of Parkland Elementary School in El Paso, Texas. In 2020, Boyd was named a winner of the H-E-B Excellence in Education Award. Her other accolades include being named the 2016 Texas National Distinguished Principal of the Year by the Texas Elementary Principals and Supervisors Association as well as the 2007 Texas Teacher of the Year by the Texas Association of School Administrators. Boyd joined the Governing Board in 2017; she chairs the Board’s Assessment Development Committee and serves on the Executive Committee. Tyler Cramer, General Public Representative (reappointed) : Cramer is the CEO of Remarc Associates, LLC. Cramer is a leader in the San Diego education and business community, having previously served as chair of the San Diego Business Roundtable for Education, education committee chair of the San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce (where he also was director), and member of the California Longitudinal Pupil Achievement Data System Advisory Board. Cramer joined the Governing Board in 2017. Viola Garcia, Local School Board Member : Garcia has served on the Aldine Independent School District Board of Trustees in Texas since 1992. She was elected president of the National School Boards Association in 2021. Garcia is an emeritus professor in the department of urban education at the University of Houston-Downtown, where she trains future teachers for local school districts. Scott Marion, Testing and Measurement Expert : Marion is the president and executive director of the National Center for the Improvement of Educational Assessment – a nonprofit consulting firm that aims to increase student learning through educational assessment and accountability practices. Marion was the director of assessment and accountability for the Wyoming Department of Education from 1999 to 2003. Beverly Perdue, Governor – Democrat (reappointed) : Perdue served as governor of North Carolina from 2009 to 2013. Since leaving office, Perdue has consulted on a wide range of education issues and has initiated many education efforts, including founding DigiLEARN – a nonprofit designed to accelerate digital learning opportunities for all ages. Perdue joined the Governing Board in 2017. Secretary Cardona also named former North Carolina Gov. Beverly Perdue chair of the Governing Board for the 2021-2022 year. Perdue previously served as chair of the Board from 2018 to 2019. “We welcome these esteemed new and reappointed members who will bring important insights as our nation continues to navigate the impacts of the pandemic and the toll it has taken on our nation’s schools and students,” said Lesley Muldoon, the executive director of the Governing Board. “We will work together to ensure that NAEP continues to answer critical questions of how our nation’s students are doing, informing efforts to improve outcomes for all children.”"

Along with the fact sheet, OCR released a letter to educators highlighting the civil rights obligations of schools and postsecondary institutions to students with mental health disabilities. “The COVID-19 pandemic’s effects on student mental health are widespread and deeply concerning,” the Department of Education’s Acting Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Suzanne B. Goldberg. “OCR is committed to providing resources to support students with mental health disabilities, including those who may be at risk for self-harm.” “The Department of Justice is committed to safeguarding the rights of students with mental health disabilities through vigorous enforcement of the civil rights laws, particularly given the continuing effects of the pandemic,” said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division. “Students should be supported and not excluded from educational opportunities on the basis of disability.” OCR’s June 2021 report, Education in a Pandemic: The Disparate Impacts of COVID-19 on America’s Students , showed that COVID-19 has had disproportionately harsh effects on many students with disabilities. Today’s action responds to the pandemic’s effects on students’ mental health and provides information about the federal civil rights laws that protect students with mental health disabilities. The fact sheet entitled Supporting and Protecting the Rights of Students at Risk of Self-Harm in the Era of COVID-19 , provides information about federal civil rights laws that protect students with mental health disabilities. It includes scenarios that illustrate when the Department might investigate a potential violation; gives schools and postsecondary institutions a list of action steps to create an environment that is responsive to students with mental health disabilities; and provides educational and crisis resources for students, families, and educators. World Mental Health Day is an international day to raise awareness of mental health issues around the world and to mobilize efforts in support of mental health. More than 18 months into the COVID-19 pandemic, it is particularly important to acknowledge the pandemic’s impact on mental health at home and around the world, to present an opportunity for meaningful conversations about mental health, and to celebrate schools and other institutions that have found new and promising ways to provide mental health services to their populations. The Biden-Harris Administration has taken significant action to address the mental health needs of Americans, including through historic resources in the American Rescue Plan that can be used right now to support expanded mental health services in schools. In addition, President Biden’s Build Back Better Agenda includes funding and support for a wide range of programs aimed at improving access to mental health services. If you believe that you or another person has been discriminated against at school based on a mental health disability, you may file a complaint with the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division at https://civilrights.justice.gov/ or https://www.ada.gov/fact_on_complaint.htm , or with the Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights at https://www2.ed.gov/ocr/complaintintro.html to file a complaint in English or www.ed.gov/ocr/docs/howto.html to file a complaint in other languages. The fact sheet is on the Department of Justice’s website and, separately, on OCR’s website at https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/ocr-factsheet-students-self-harm-covid-19.pdf ."

The Office of Enforcement will strengthen oversight of and enforcement actions against postsecondary schools that participate in the federal student loan, grant, and work-study programs. Today's action restores an office that was first established in 2016, but deprioritized in the previous administration. ""Vigorously ensuring that schools are adhering to the federal student aid program rules and delivering quality education to students is critical in America's ability to build back better,"" said Under Secretary James Kvaal. ""The Administration will prioritize Federal Student Aid's effective oversight and enforcement of postsecondary schools."" The Enforcement Office will be led by Kristen Donoghue, as the chief enforcement officer, who will report directly to FSA Chief Operating Officer Richard Cordray. Donoghue joined FSA in July as a senior advisor to the chief operating officer, bringing a wealth of enforcement and leadership experience. Donoghue previously served as the enforcement director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), where she led a 140-person office responsible for enforcement of federal consumer financial laws covering a range of financial services companies including the largest banks in the country. Under her leadership, the CFPB pursued hundreds of investigations and filed numerous significant public enforcement actions, including obtaining the highest civil money penalty in the CFPB's history, a $1 billion fine against Wells Fargo. Most recently, Donoghue served as a managing vice president at Capital One Bank, where she headed a team focused on legal and regulatory compliance. ""Kristen brings a strong enforcement track record to this role,"" said Chief Operating Officer Richard Cordray. ""Her experienced leadership will drive greater accountability for schools and better educational outcomes for the students we serve."" The Enforcement Office will proactively identify and address major problems across institutions that pose widespread risks to students and taxpayers. The office will work closely with the Partner Participation and Oversight Office on a risk-based approach to oversight and compliance. It will comprise four existing divisions: Administrative Actions and Appeals Services Group: This group fines, limits, suspends, terminates, and imposes emergency actions against postsecondary institutions that participate in the federal student aid programs. The group also issues actions, such as revocations and recertification denials; initiates debarment and suspension proceedings against individuals and other parties; and resolves appeals of final audit and program review determinations. Borrower Defense Group: This group analyzes borrower defense to repayment claims and recommends appropriate dispositions to Department leadership. The group communicates with postsecondary institutions about borrower defense claims and coordinates across FSA and with investigative and enforcement divisions of federal and state agencies related to individual borrower defense claims. Investigations Group: This group evaluates indicators of potential misconduct or high-risk conduct by postsecondary institutions and third-party servicers, and investigates institutions' compliance with federal laws, regulations, and the terms of program participation. This group will collaborate with other agencies that have complementary enforcement resources, such as the Department of Justice, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Federal Trade Commission, and state attorneys general. Resolution and Referral Management Group: This group tracks and resolves referrals, reports of suspicious activity, allegations, and complaints about institutions and individuals that participate in the federal student aid programs. FSA receives feedback from sources that include the general public; students; school officials; individuals within FSA and the Department; and external oversight and higher education stakeholders, such as the Department's Office of Inspector General, U.S. Department of Defense, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. As part of FSA's heightened enforcement activities and actions to uphold civil law and promote borrower protection, FSA will coordinate with other state and federal partners. In particular, FSA plans to work closely with the Federal Trade Commission, which earlier this week announced a major shift in its enforcement priorities to focus on postsecondary schools that illegally engage in unfair and deceptive acts or practices. ""The Department of Education has critical oversight responsibilities over the integrity of the benefit and student loan programs under Title IV of the Higher Education Act,"" said FTC Commissioner Rohit Chopra. ""By working more closely together, FTC investigations can assist the Department of Education in taking additional administrative actions against those that violate the law."" Today's announcement follows actions the Biden-Harris Administration has taken to protect students and taxpayers from poor-performing programs, including: Approving 100% borrower defense discharge, totaling more than $556 million, for students harmed by ITT Institutes, Westwood College, Marinello Schools of Beauty, and the Court Reporting Institute. Revising the Department's position on preemption of state oversight to foster closer coordination and joint action between FSA and state officials, which ensures stronger protections for fair treatment of students, parents, and borrowers. Resolving liabilities identified in program review and audit determination of postsecondary institutions, totaling more than $4.1 million. Denying the application of Florida Coastal School of Law to resume its participation in the federal student loan program. Initiating actions against school executives who failed to put students' interests first. And, Elevating the FSA ombudsman to report to FSA's chief operating officer to put more focus on the voice of the customer and FSA's commitment to taking actionable steps to improve customers' experiences and outcomes with the federal student aid programs. This week, the Department held the first session of negotiated rulemaking sessions focused on college affordability and student loans. The rulemaking committee is expected to address issues affecting student loan borrowers, including borrower defense to repayment for students harmed by their colleges' misleading practices, recovering from institutions the amount of relief granted to borrowers under a successful borrower defense claim, closed school discharge, and pre-dispute arbitration."

Wyoming's plan details how the state is using and plans to use ARP ESSER funds to safely reopen and sustain the safe operation of schools and equitably expand opportunity for students who need it most, particularly those most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. As students and states return to school, the Department released the Return To School Roadmap , which provides key resources and supports for students, parents, educators, and school communities to build excitement around returning to classrooms this school year and outlines how federal funding can support the safe and sustained return to in-person learning. ARP funds can be used to support the roadmap's efforts. Earlier this year, the Department distributed two-thirds of the ARP ESSER funds, totaling $81 billion, to 50 states and the District of Columbia. The remaining third of the funding to states will be made available once state plans are approved. Wyoming is receiving more than $303 million total in ARP ESSER funds, and today's approval of their plan will result in the release of the final $101 million. Additionally, the Department approved Michigan's state plan. Today's approvals mean a total of 41 ARP ESSER state plans have been approved since June. ""I am excited to announce approval of Wyoming's plan,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""It is heartening to see, reflected in these state plans, the ways in which states are thinking deeply about how to use American Rescue Plan funds to continue to provide critical support to schools and communities, particularly as we enter the upcoming academic year. The approval of these plans enables states to receive vital, additional American Rescue Plan funds to quickly and safely reopen schools for full-time, in-person learning; meet students' academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs; and address disparities in access to educational opportunity that were exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. The state plans that have been submitted to the Department lay the groundwork for the ways in which an unprecedented infusion of federal resources will be used to address the urgent needs of America's children and build back better."" ""Wyoming is anxious to fund and implement transformational educational initiatives that narrow learning gaps and extend learning opportunities,"" said State Superintendent of Public Instruction Jillian Balow. ""My office and I look forward to supporting communities in their endeavors."" The ARP ESSER state plans approved by the Department today, including Wyoming, show how states are using federal pandemic resources to support safe, in-person instruction and meet the social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs of students—with a focus on the students most impacted by the pandemic. For example: Safely Reopening Schools and Sustaining Safe Operations: The Wyoming Department of Education (WDE) developed a Smart Start Guidance document for the reopening of schools. The Smart Start Taskforce facilitated a series of meetings during May and June 2020 to consider research and utilize CDC Guidance and state and local health requirements to develop a practical guidance tool to assist school districts in reopening in the fall of 2020 and 2021. Schools are continuing to operate using the structures developed in the Smart Start Guidance, including CDC guidance, and state and local health requirements. Addressing the Academic Impact of Lost Instructional Time: The WDE will award some ARP ESSER funds through competitive district grants titled ""Addressing Gaps and Accelerated Learning."" Districts will select evidence-based interventions consistent with student needs and specific focus areas, including kindergarten readiness, computer science, postsecondary partnerships, postsecondary transition programming, and content specific professional development. Additionally, interventions will include Tribal or Wind River Reservation district partnerships. Grant applications will open immediately with anticipated award notification no later than Dec. 15, 2021. Staffing to Support Students' Needs: With ARP ESSER funds, the WDE has funded a State School Nurse position to provide assistance to districts on implementation of state and local health orders. Additionally, the WDE will use ARP ESSER funds to add necessary staff in districts including highly-qualified interventionists and tutors, counselors, school psychologists, and paraprofessionals. Funds will be made available immediately to support LEAs and activities identified in the ARP state plan. All 52 State Education Agencies have submitted their ARP ESSER state plans to the Department. The Department is reviewing the plans expeditiously and is in contact with states to ensure their plans meet all necessary requirements in order to access the remaining funds, as outlined in the ARP. The distribution of ARP ESSER funds is part of the Department's broader effort to support students and districts as they work to re-engage students impacted by the pandemic, address inequities exacerbated by COVID-19, and build our education system back better than before. In addition to providing $130 billion for K-12 education in the American Rescue Plan to support the safe reopening of K-12 schools and meet the needs of all students, the Biden-Harris Administration also has: Held the Return To School Road Trip , a bus tour that visited schools across five states in five days to celebrate the safe return to school. Launched the Return To School Roadmap to provide key resources and supports for students, parents, educators, and school communities to build excitement around returning to classrooms this school year and outline how federal funding can support the safe and sustained return to in-person learning. Released three volumes of the COVID-19 Handbook. Hosted a National Safe School Reopening Summit . Announced a new grant program to provide additional funding to school districts that have been financially penalized for implementing strategies to prevent the spread of COVID-19, such as universal indoor masking. Prioritized the vaccination of educators, school staff, and childcare workers. Provided $10 billion in funding for COVID-19 testing for preK-12 educators, staff, and students. Launched a series of equity summits focused on addressing inequities that existed before but were made worse by the pandemic. Released a report on the disparate impacts of COVID-19 on underserved communities. Developed a Safer Schools and Campuses Best Practices Clearinghouse elevating hundreds of best practices to support schools' efforts to reopen safely and address the impacts of COVID-19 on students, educators, and communities. In addition to the actions the Biden Administration has taken to reopen schools, the President has proposed critical investments through his Build Back Better Agenda that will enable schools to rebuild stronger than they were before the pandemic, such as investing billions to build a diverse educator workforce, expand access to pre-K to all families, and invest in school infrastructure, among other provisions."

""As we work to emerge from the pandemic, it is critical that our Michigan schools have the federal resources necessary to ensure a safe and effective learning environment for students, teachers, and staff,"" said Sen. Gary Peters. ""Now that Michigan's plan is approved for using this American Rescue Plan funding we secured, our state can support additional efforts to expand early childhood education and literacy opportunities, while also enabling educators and students to be healthy and safe at schools."" ""This pandemic has taken a huge toll on our education system. While we work to get the United States back on track, I'm thrilled that the Department of Education approved Michigan's plan to use valuable American Rescue Plan resources to support our schools,"" said Rep. Brenda L. Lawrence. ""I'm especially proud to have fought for this funding in the COVID stimulus package, and I'm grateful that the Biden Administration is leading the way to building back better. This funding will significantly help in maintaining the health, safety, and success of our students, teachers, and school staff."" ""The pandemic has taken a toll on education in our country — from learning loss to emotional and social impact and more for young students,"" said Rep. Debbie Dingell. ""Together with the Biden-Harris Administration, Congress worked to provide critical resources through the American Rescue Plan.

""I met with school superintendents from Macomb and Oakland Counties earlier this week, and they all shared just how difficult this moment is for them,"" said Rep. Andy Levin. ""From learning loss to educator shortages, there is much we need to address. That's why I'm thrilled to see the Department of Education approve Michigan's plan to utilize the American Rescue Plan funds in a targeted and thoughtful way. I am confident that these resources will uplift every student, educator, staff and community member throughout Michigan."" ""Students and educators in Michigan's 11th District have already benefitted immensely from the resources provided by President Biden's American Rescue Plan,"" said Rep. Haley Stevens. ""I am so grateful to the Department of Education for their approval of our state's plan, enabling a safe return to the classroom and expanding learning opportunities. This was a bipartisan effort that reflects the interests of all Michiganders in helping our children thrive and getting parents back to work."" The ARP ESSER state plans approved by the Department today, including Michigan's, show how states are using federal pandemic resources to support safe, in-person instruction and meet the social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs of students—with a focus on the students most impacted by the pandemic. For example: Returning to In-Person Learning in 2021: All traditional public school districts are operating predominantly in-person this year, and all students have access to in-person learning. Safely Reopening Schools and Sustaining Safe Operations: The Michigan Department of Education (MDE) has promoted collaborative partnerships between districts and local health departments to conduct vaccination clinics. In partnership with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, the MI Safe Schools Testing Program supports schools in providing COVID-19 testing to allow for safe, in-person learning. MDHHS is providing over $24 million in additional federal funding to school districts and local public health departments to hire 220 Health Resource Advocates to effectively support school-based COVID-19 testing and reporting. Addressing the Academic Impact of Lost Instructional Time and Expanding Summer and Afterschool Programs: School districts that receive state reserve funds will select evidence-based interventions that address the academic and social-emotional needs of their student populations that are most impacted by the pandemic. Districts will complete additional budget information and documentation on how they will use ARP ESSER funds for students disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. All 52 State Education Agencies have submitted their ARP ESSER state plans to the Department.

These additional funds mean local education agencies can continue that important, timely work.” “As students, parents, and teachers across the country were faced with the unprecedented challenge of conducting school during a global pandemic, President Biden and Democrats in Congress came together this year to pass the American Rescue Plan with historic relief for our nation’s public schools,” said Rep. Emanuel Cleaver. “With the Department of Education’s approval of Missouri’s plan, our state will now have federal resources needed to not only address the learning loss and emotional turbulence students have been burdened with since March of 2020, but to build back better than before by making substantial investments to reduce the digital divide and shore up our educator workforce. This is a critical step in helping our students, teachers, and communities recover from the pandemic, and I couldn’t be prouder to have supported the American Rescue Plan, which made these opportunities possible.” “For over a year, St. Louis schools have grappled with a devastating pandemic that has disrupted critical learning opportunities for our students. We must work to ensure the needs of students, teachers, support staff, and parents are met for the duration of this public health emergency and long after it ends,” said Rep. Cori Bush. “The American Rescue Plan has delivered billions of dollars in investments to aid our district’s recovery. The Department of Education’s approval of Missouri’s Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief plan is a welcomed endeavor as Congress and the Biden-Harris Administration work to address the harms of this ongoing crisis. This $1.96 billion in essential resources will undoubtedly help our schools invest in strong mitigation efforts to curb the spread of COVID-19, assist in new hiring opportunities for educators, and allow us to better meet the social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs of our students.” The ARP ESSER state plans approved by the Department today, including Missouri’s, show how states are using federal pandemic resources to support safe, in-person instruction and meet the social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs of students—with a focus on the students most impacted by the pandemic. For example: Safely Reopening Schools and Sustaining Safe Operations: The Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (MO DESE) has promoted statewide vaccination events and has collaborated with the state health agency to offer school districts a wide variety of options for COVID-19 screening testing for the 2021-2022 school year. MO DESE continues to share vaccine-related information with stakeholders and encourage local school leaders to consider vaccination of eligible students and staff as a key mitigation strategy. MO DESE continues to work with state health officials to update school reopening and operating guidance as needed. Addressing the Academic Impact of Lost Instructional Time: Pending General Assembly spending authority, MO DESE will implement its intervention plans to leverage ARP ESSER funds. MO DESE intends to launch the state’s literacy initiative to ensure all children can read by the end of second grade. MO DESE also will invest in a competency-based learning pilot to reach students who have fallen behind. These efforts will be further supported by content experts who will provide added professional development opportunities to educators through the state’s nine Regional Professional Development Centers. In addition, MO DESE plans to use funds to expand access to broadband. Supporting the Educator Workforce: MO DESE will offer both teacher recruitment retention grants to all local education agencies (LEAs). The application process will include a review of local data on teacher turnover as well as strategies the LEA will implement to address their shortage areas. The grant allocation process provides additional funds to those LEAs with harder to fill positions, such as LEAs serving higher numbers of students of color and students from low-income backgrounds. ARP ESSER funds will be used to support research-based strategies, including, but not limited to: strengthening the mentor program for early career teachers, utilizing culture and climate surveys to determine and address working condition issues, and providing services that address the social-emotional needs of teachers.

Arizona’s plan details how the state is using and plans to use ARP ESSER funds to safely reopen and sustain the safe operation of schools and equitably expand opportunity for students who need it most, particularly those most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Department continues to encourage all states and school districts to follow CDC guidance to protect students, educators, and support staff from COVID-19. Today’s approval will ensure funds are available to the state and local districts to safely support and maintain in-person instructions. The Department will continue to closely review and monitor whether Arizona is meeting all of its federal fiscal requirements for ESSER funds.

This plan provides a recovery roadmap for our public schools and the students they serve by prioritizing support for student mental health, academic enrichment, and reinforcements for accelerating learning,” said Arizona Superintendent of Public Instruction Kathy Hoffman. “I am grateful for the input and expertise of the broad group of educators, school leaders, and community stakeholders who helped inform the plan. Working together to support the needs of our students must be our sole focus in the years ahead, and I am optimistic about what we can accomplish together as a state in support of our students’ futures.” “Arizona students, educators, and families have faced immense challenges over the past year and a half as we’ve navigated the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Sen. Mark Kelly. “With students back in the classroom, it is critical that schools receive the resources they need to support students. That’s why I voted to pass the American Rescue Plan back in March, and with the approval of Arizona’s plan today, we can continue working toward recovery, re-engagement, and learning reinforcement for Arizona’s students.” “Students in Arizona have been greatly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, both inside and outside the classroom,” said Rep. Ruben Gallego. “Almost immediately after taking office, the Biden-Harris Administration swiftly moved to provide students the resources needed to overcome the obstacles of the past 19 months, and I’m glad to see the Department of Education approve Arizona’s plan to get these American Rescue Plan funds into classrooms.” The ARP ESSER state plans approved by the Department today, including Arizona’s, show how states are using federal pandemic resources to support safe, in-person instruction and meet the social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs of students—with a focus on the students most impacted by the pandemic. For example: Returning to In-Person Learning in 2021: Arizona schools have returned to in-person instruction for the 2021-2022 school year. Arizona Department of Education (ADE) launched the Ready for School campaign, which ran from June 2021 through September 2021, to encourage students and families to re-enroll in their public schools. The campaign used videos and advertisements to highlight the benefits of in-person instruction. ADE also created a hotline to support parents through the re-enrollment process. Addressing the Academic Impact of Lost Instructional Time and Expanding Summer and Afterschool Programs: ADE will implement evidence-based interventions that focus on three priorities: enrichment and reinforcement of learning; mental, behavioral, and physical health support for students and educators; and student and family re-engagement and support. Supporting the Educator Workforce: ADE has partnered with the state’s three universities and has created a dedicated Educator Recruitment and Retention team to support schools with recruitment, retention, and professional development strategies in partnership with local communities. This team also has developed and implemented Principal and Supervisor of Principal professional learning academies to build leadership capacity in school districts and charter schools to provide support for students and educators. Separately this week, the Treasury Department notified the Governor of Arizona that it was concerned that two of the state-run grant programs using Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds undermine evidence-based efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19 and are not a permissible use of funds. All 52 State Education Agencies have submitted their ARP ESSER state plans to the Department. The Department is reviewing the plans expeditiously and is in contact with states to ensure their plans meet all necessary requirements in order to access the remaining funds, as outlined in the ARP. The distribution of ARP ESSER funds is part of the Department’s broader effort to support students and districts as they work to re-engage students impacted by the pandemic, address inequities exacerbated by COVID-19, and build our education system back better than before. In addition to providing $130 billion for K-12 education in the American Rescue Plan to support the safe reopening of K-12 schools and meet the needs of all students, the Biden-Harris Administration also has: Held the Return To School Road Trip , a bus tour that visited schools across five states in five days to celebrate the safe return to school. Launched the Return To School Roadmap to provide key resources and supports for students, parents, educators, and school communities to build excitement around returning to classrooms this school year and outline how federal funding can support the safe and sustained return to in-person learning. Released three volumes of the COVID-19 Handbook. Hosted a National Safe School Reopening Summit . Announced a new grant program to provide additional funding to school districts that have been financially penalized for implementing strategies to prevent the spread of COVID-19, such as universal indoor masking. Prioritized the vaccination of educators, school staff, and child care workers. Provided $10 billion in funding for COVID-19 testing for pre-K-12 educators, staff, and students. Launched a series of equity summits focused on addressing inequities that existed before, but were made worse by the pandemic. Released a report on the disparate impacts of COVID-19 on underserved communities. Developed a Safer Schools and Campuses Best Practices Clearinghouse elevating hundreds of best practices to support schools’ efforts to reopen safely and address the impacts of COVID-19 on students, educators, and communities. In addition to the actions the Biden Administration has taken to reopen schools, the President has proposed critical investments through his Build Back Better agenda that will enable schools to rebuild stronger than they were before the pandemic, such as investing billions to build a diverse educator workforce, expand access to pre-K to all families, and invest in school infrastructure, among other provisions."

6-Oct-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/fact-sheet-public-service-loan-forgiveness-pslf-program-overhaul,Fact Sheet: Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Program Overhaul,"The Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Program is an important—but largely unmet—promise to provide debt relief to support the teachers, nurses, firefighters, and others serving their communities through hard work that is essential to our country’s success. By cancelling loans after 10 years of public service, PSLF removes the burden of student debt on public servants, makes it possible for many borrowers to stay in their jobs, and entices others to work in high-need fields. Today, the Department of Education is announcing a set of actions that, over the coming months, will restore the promise of PSLF. We will offer a time-limited waiver so that student borrowers can count payments from all federal loan programs or repayment plans toward forgiveness. This includes loan types and payment plans that were not previously eligible. We will pursue opportunities to automate PSLF eligibility, give borrowers a way to get errors corrected, and make it easier for members of the military to get credit toward forgiveness while they serve. We will pair these changes with an expanded communications campaign to make sure affected borrowers learn about these opportunities and encourage them to apply. These changes are important steps toward a better and stronger PSLF program, one that will move away from the current situation in which too few borrowers receive forgiveness, and too many do not receive credit for years of payments they made because of complicated eligibility rules, servicing errors or other technicalities. The Department is also working to identify further improvements to ensure public servants get the relief they deserve, including partnerships with employers and revising regulations. These actions are informed by the more than 48,000 comments the Department received on a request for information on improving PSLF issued over the summer. The Department estimates that the limited waiver alone will help over 550,000 borrowers who had previously consolidated their loans see their progress toward PSLF grow automatically, with the average borrower receiving 23 additional payments. This includes approximately 22,000 borrowers who will be immediately eligible to have their federal student loans discharged without further action on their part, totaling $1.74 billion in forgiveness. Another 27,000 borrowers could potentially qualify for $2.82 billion in forgiveness if they certify additional periods of employment. For reference, just over 16,000 borrowers have ever received forgiveness under PSLF prior to this action. We anticipate that many more will also receive additional credit as we implement other changes over time, such as counting previously ineligible payments that were not affected by a loan consolidation. The COVID-19 pandemic has placed a tremendous strain on public servants, making it even more critical that borrowers are able to access PSLF. Many public servants have been on the front lines of the pandemic, making personal sacrifices to keep the rest of us safe. Nonprofits are still recovering jobs lost in the last year, and some public service workers have reported they are considering leaving public service altogether. Frontline sectors like teaching and healthcare are already seeing burnout and employee shortages. Alleviating some of the financial strain associated with student debt can help borrowers in these sectors as they continue to navigate the fallout of this pandemic. Today the Department is announcing it will: Implement a Limited PSLF Waiver to count all prior payments made by student borrowers toward PSLF, regardless of loan program. The Department will be offering a temporary opportunity to give borrowers credit for prior payments they made that would not otherwise count toward PSLF. Any prior payments made while working for a qualifying employer will count as a qualifying payment, regardless of loan type or repayment plan. This Limited PSLF Waiver will apply to borrowers with Direct Loans, those who have already consolidated into the Direct Loan Program, and those with other types of federal student loans who submit a consolidation application into the Direct Loan Program while the waiver is in effect. The waiver applies to loans taken out by students. The waiver will run through October 31, 2022. That means borrowers who need to consolidate will have to submit a consolidation application by that date. Similarly, borrowers will need to submit a PSLF form—the single application used for a review of employment certification, payment counts, and processing of forgiveness—on or before October 31, 2022 to have previously ineligible payments counted. The Department recommends borrowers take this action through the online PSLF Help Tool, which is available at StudentAid.gov/PSLF . Counting prior payments on additional types of loans will be particularly important for borrowers who have or had loans from the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program. Around 60 percent of borrowers who have certified employment for PSLF fall into this category. Many FFEL borrowers report receiving inaccurate information from their servicers about how to make progress toward PSLF, and a recent report by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) revealed that some FFEL servicers have systematically misled borrowers on accessing PSLF. Counting payments made on FFEL loans toward PSLF will correct these issues and help address the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on student loan borrowers. Payments prior to a Direct Loan consolidation are also covered by this waiver, so it will benefit those who consolidated their Direct Loans and lost progress toward PSLF as a result. The Department will start automatically adjusting payment counts for borrowers who have already consolidated their loans into the Direct Loan Program and certified some employment for PSLF, and those borrowers can expect to see these adjustments in their accounts in the coming months. Borrowers who have loans from the FFEL or Federal Perkins Loan programs will also have this waiver applied automatically, but only after they have consolidated and submitted a PSLF form, and all paperwork has been processed. Simplify what it means for a payment to qualify for PSLF . The Limited PSLF Waiver also addresses another concern we have heard from borrowers—that too many payments do not count toward PSLF due to technical requirements around borrowers’ choice of payment plan, timing, and amount of the payment. In some instances, borrowers missed out on credit toward PSLF because their payments were off by a penny or two or late by only a few days. The Department will automatically adjust PSLF payment counts for payments made on or before October 31, 2021 for borrowers affected by this issue who have already certified some employment for PSLF. Borrowers who have not yet applied for PSLF forgiveness or certified employment but do so by October 31, 2022 will benefit from these temporary rules as well. Eliminate barriers for military service members to receive PSLF . The Department will allow months spent on active duty to count toward PSLF, even if the service member’s loans were on a deferment or forbearance rather than in active repayment. This change addresses one major challenge service members face in accessing PSLF. Service members on active duty can qualify for student loan deferments and forbearances that help them through periods in which service inhibits their ability to make payments. But too often, members of the military find out that those same deferments or forbearances granted while they served our country did not count toward PSLF. This change ensures that members of the military will not need to focus on their student loans while serving our country. Federal Student Aid will develop and implement a process to address periods of student loan deferments and forbearance for active-duty service members and will update affected borrowers to let them know what they need to do to take advantage of this change. Automatically help service members and other federal employees access PSLF . Military service members and other federal employees devote themselves to serving the United States, and we should make it as easy as possible for them to get PSLF. Next year, the Department will begin automatically giving federal employees credit for PSLF by matching Department of Education data with information held by other federal agencies about service members and the federal workforce. To date, approximately 110,000 federal employees and 17,000 service members have certified some employment toward PSLF. These matches will help the Department identify others who may also be eligible but cannot benefit automatically, like those with FFEL loans. Review Denied PSLF Applications and Identify and Correct Errors in PSLF Processing . Errors in the review and processing of PSLF applications has been a particularly worrisome barrier to PSLF access. Many borrowers report discrepancies in their PSLF payment counts, and PHEAA, the student loan servicer responsible for processing PSLF payments, has entered into a settlement with the Massachusetts Attorney General to review PSLF applications for potential errors. FSA will be transitioning PSLF accounts away from PHEAA to a new servicer. Under Secretary Cardona’s leadership, the Department is committed to holding all student loan servicers to high standards of quality and accountability, and that includes PSLF servicing. Today, the Department is announcing that it will complete a review of all denied PSLF applications and PSLF processing practices to identify and address errors. This will include an internal data review on denied PSLF applications and an independent external review of PSLF processing. Borrowers who believe there have been errors in processing their PSLF application after the Department first conducts the internal and external reviews described above will be able to use an interim reconsideration process to receive a second individual review next year. A permanent reconsideration process is under consideration in the negotiated rulemaking process. To further strengthen oversight of PSLF, the Department will improve its reporting on PSLF, including information on timelines for processing applications and results of servicer audits. Improve Outreach and Communication with PSLF-Eligible Borrowers . The Department wants borrowers to know about PSLF and help those who may be close to forgiveness take the steps they need to get relief. Starting this fall, we will begin an extensive outreach campaign to make sure borrowers are better informed about this key benefit. This will include emailing borrowers who have hit 120 PSLF-eligible payments during the pause but need to verify their employment to receive forgiveness. ED will also notify borrowers about any additional payments we are able to automatically count and the option for reconsideration of denied applications, as applicable. We will also work to ensure that all potentially eligible borrowers are aware of the improvements to PSLF and tools available to them. Simplify the PSLF Application Process . We can and should make it easier for borrowers to apply for PSLF. In the coming year, FSA will make several improvements that will create a smoother application process. These include working with local governments, state education agencies, school districts, labor unions, and others to improve FSA’s database of qualifying employers and creating an option to digitally sign PSLF applications. ED will also explore other improvements, like allowing employers to sign employment certification forms on behalf of their employees and automating PSLF certification for state, local, and tribal government employees. Make Long-Term Improvements to PSLF through Rulemaking . In addition to the executive actions outlined here, ED plans to continue transforming PSLF through the negotiated rulemaking process . This week, ED began the first session of negotiated rulemaking, which includes PSLF on the agenda. The Department’s regulatory proposal includes changes that would make it easier for borrowers to make progress toward forgiveness, including simplifying qualifying payment rules and allowing certain types of deferments and forbearances to count toward PSLF. What Borrowers Need to Know . ED will roll out these improvements in groups over the coming months. For more information, please visit StudentAid.gov/PSLFWaiver . Borrowers should also ensure we have accurate contact information on file by registering for an FSA ID at StudentAid.gov/create-account or updating their StudentAid.gov contact information by logging in and visiting StudentAid.gov/settings. By creating an account, we can communicate with you directly in a personalized way about how this waiver and other matters might affect you. The Limited PSLF Waiver will be available to borrowers who have Direct Loans, Federal Family Education Loans, and Perkins Loans. The waiver applies to loans taken out by students. You have Direct Loans and you’ve already had some PSLF employment certified If you’ve already applied for PSLF and had at least some employment certified, the Department will award any additional payments we can without further action from you. If necessary, Federal Student Aid may contact you to ask you to certify additional months of employment. You should look out for an email from Federal Student Aid in the coming weeks to let you know how many additional payments we have preliminarily determined to be qualifying. You don’t need to do anything until you receive an updated payment count or other communication from us. If you know that you have qualifying employment that you have not yet certified with us, we recommend you certify that employment now by using the PSLF Help Tool at www.StudentAid.gov/pslf . You currently have Direct Loans and have not yet applied for PSLF You will need to submit a PSLF form so we can review your loans under the simplified rules and determine whether your current or past employers qualify for PSLF. You can submit this form through the PSLF Help Tool at StudentAid.gov/PSLF . Because we expect an influx of applicants due to this announcement, you may see some delays in having your application processed, but we will work as quickly as possible to assist you. You will need to submit your application by October 31, 2022. You have at least one federal student loan that is not a Direct Loan, such as a FFEL loan You will need to submit a consolidation application and a PSLF form by October 31, 2022 to ensure that payments made on loans that are not Direct Loans can be counted toward PSLF. Right now, we encourage you to consolidate before using the PSLF Help Tool to certify employment. If you want to check your employer’s eligibility for PSLF before you consolidate, you can do so by logging into the PSLF Help Tool, which is available at StudentAid.gov/PSLF . If you have a mix of FFEL and Direct Loans, please refer to the sections above to understand how your Direct Loans will be affected. We are working to update the PSLF Help Tool, but it will not be configured for borrowers with non-Direct Loans to submit a PSLF form until later this year. We will provide more information when this update is done. To find out more about loan consolidation visit StudentAid.gov/Manage-Loans/Consolidation . You previously tried to certify employment for PSLF but were denied If the Department previously said your employer was not eligible for PSLF then you need to submit a new form through the PSLF Help Tool to see if you can receive credit toward forgiveness. You can also see which employers the Department has already deemed eligible through the PSLF Help Tool. Please note that this waiver does not affect qualifying employer rules. Your employer still needs to be a governmental organization, a 501(c)(3) organization, or a not-for-profit organization that provides a designated public service to get PSLF under normal rules and the Limited PSLF Waiver. You don’t know what kind of federal loans you have It’s very common for borrowers to not know what kind of federal loans they have. You can see what loans you have by logging into your account on StudentAid.gov, going to the My Aid page ( StudentAid.gov/aid-summary/ ), and scrolling down to the Loan Breakdown section. There, you’ll see a list of each loan you have borrowed, even if you have paid the loan off or consolidated it into a new loan. Direct Loans begin with the word “Direct.” Federal Family Education Loans start with “FFEL,” and Perkins Loans include the word “Perkins” in the name. You have further questions In the coming weeks, servicers will receive updated information from FSA to help you navigate these changes. If you encounter challenges working with your loan servicer, you should contact the FSA Ombudsman by visiting StudentAid.gov/feedback."

This policy will result in 22,000 borrowers who have consolidated loans—including previously ineligible loans—being immediately eligible for $1.74 billion in forgiveness without the need for further action on their part. Another 27,000 borrowers could potentially qualify for an additional $2.82 billion in forgiveness if they certify additional periods of employment. All told, the Department estimates that over 550,000 borrowers who have previously consolidated will see an increase in qualifying payments with the average borrower receiving another two years of progress toward forgiveness. Many more will also see progress as borrowers consolidate into the Direct Loan program and apply for PSLF, and as the Department rolls out other changes in the weeks and months ahead. “Borrowers who devote a decade of their lives to public service should be able to rely on the promise of Public Service Loan Forgiveness. The system has not delivered on that promise to date, but that is about to change for many borrowers who have served their communities and their country,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “Teachers, nurses, first responders, servicemembers, and so many public service workers have had our back especially amid the challenges of the pandemic. Today, the Biden Administration is showing that we have their backs, too.” The changes announced today include: A limited PSLF waiver that allows all payments by student borrowers to count toward PSLF, regardless of loan program or payment plan . This waiver will allow student borrowers to count all payments made on loans from the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program or Perkins Loan Program. It will also waive restrictions on the type of repayment plan and the requirement that payments be made in the full amount and on-time for all borrowers. To receive these benefits, borrowers will have to submit a PSLF form by October 31, 2022, which is a single application used to certify employment and evaluate a borrower for forgiveness. Borrowers who currently have FFEL, Perkins, or other non-Direct Loans, will get the benefit of this limited waiver if they apply to consolidate into the Direct Loan program and submit a PSLF form by October 31, 2022. The waiver applies to loans taken out by students. Allowing active duty service members to count deferments and forbearances toward PSLF. This solves a problem for service members who have paused payments while on active duty but were not getting credit toward PSLF. Automatically providing credit toward PSLF for military service members and federal employees using federal data matches . The Department will implement data matches next year to give these borrowers credit toward PSLF without an application. Reviewing denied PSLF applications for errors and giving borrowers the ability to have their PSLF determinations reconsidered . These actions will help identify and address servicing errors or other issues that have prevented borrowers from getting the PSLF credit they deserve. On Wednesday afternoon, Secretary Cardona and Under Secretary James Kvaal will meet with a group of public servants who stand to benefit from these changes, including a member of the Army National Guard, a math teacher, and an epidemiologist, among others. These changes represent a significant step in the Department’s efforts to transform the PSLF Program. The Department is exploring additional steps, such as partnerships with employers, to continue to make this process easier for borrowers. Last week, the Department released materials for the first session of negotiated rulemaking, including proposals to make lasting changes to make it easier for borrowers to make progress toward PSLF. Federal Student Aid will make more information available to borrowers at StudentAid.gov/PSLFWaiver . In the coming weeks and months, the Department will communicate directly with borrowers about these changes to PSLF to help borrowers understand how they may benefit and any actions they may need to take. Borrowers should ensure that they have accounts on StudentAid.gov and that their contact information there is up to date. Including the borrowers eligible for immediate forgiveness under these actions, the Biden-Harris Administration has now approved more than $11.5 billion in loan cancellation for over 580,000 borrowers."

23-Sep-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-awards-project-safe-funds-florida-school-district-following-state-imposed-penalty-implementing-covid-19-safety-measures,U.S. Department of Education Awards Project SAFE Funds to Florida School District Following State-Imposed Penalty for Implementing COVID-19 Safety Measures,"Today, the U.S. Department of Education awarded the School Board of Alachua County $147,719 in funding under the new Project to Support America’s Families and Educators (Project SAFE) grant program. This is the first award under Project SAFE, and funding will support the Florida school district’s efforts to protect students as they return to safe, in-person learning despite the state’s actions to prohibit implementation of strategies to limit the spread of COVID-19, consistent with science-based guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The Project SAFE program was announced as part of President Biden’s COVID-19 Action Plan to combat COVID-19 and safely reopen schools for in-person learning. As part of the program, school districts have been able to apply to the Department of Education to restore funding withheld by state leaders—such as salaries for school board members or superintendents who have had their pay cut—when a school district implemented strategies to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 in schools. “We should be thanking districts for using proven strategies that will keep schools open and safe, not punishing them. We stand with the dedicated educators in Alachua and across the country doing the right thing to protect their school communities, and with today’s first-ever award under Project SAFE, we are further enabling educators to continue that critical work,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “With these grants, we’re making sure schools and communities across the country that are committed to safely returning to in-person learning know that we have their backs. I commend Alachua for protecting its students and educators, and I look forward to working with them to provide students their best year yet. Every student across the country deserves the opportunity to return to school in-person safely this fall, and every family should be confident that their school is implementing policies that keep their children safe.” The Project SAFE program promotes student safety and well-being by providing funding to school districts that were financially penalized by an entity in their state for implementing the CDC’s science-based strategies to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The funding will help districts keep these measures in place and maintain district and school stability despite the financial penalty. Prior to the creation of the Project SAFE program, President Biden announced that if a state cuts the funding to a local school district for implementing CDC-recommended prevention strategies like universal masking, the school district may use funds from the American Rescue Plan (ARP) to fill those gaps. School districts can begin spending their ARP funds right away, including to reimburse for any allowable cost dating back to when the national emergency for COVID-19 was declared. Beyond the resources in the American Rescue Plan, the Project SAFE program makes additional funding available to help local school districts fill gaps when funding has been withheld by their state for implementing COVID safety measures. ProjectSAFE is funded under the School Safety National Activities authority in Section 4631(a)(1)(B) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). Today’s announcement marks the first Project SAFE grant award since the program was launched. CDC recommends universal indoor masking for all teachers, staff, students, and visitors to K-12 schools, regardless of vaccination status, and that children should return to full-time, in-person learning with layered prevention strategies in place to reduce potential for transmission at school. Alachua County Public Schools (ACPS) first adopted a policy that required students and district employees to wear masks on school grounds in October 2020. Consistent with CDC guidance, on Aug. 3, 2021, the ACPS School Board voted to require students and staff to wear masks during the first two weeks of school, then voted to extend this policy on Aug. 17, 2021. Shortly after the extension, the Florida State Board of Education informed ACPS that it would be subject to financial penalties due to these policies. With the Project SAFE grant funds, Alachua County Public Schools will be able to stabilize district staffing and compensation levels necessary to keep CDC recommended strategies in place and to promote student safety for its nearly 30,000 students. “Students deserve the opportunity to return to school in-person safely this fall, and our nation’s superintendents must have not only the authority to make the decisions about what that reopening looks like, but also freedom from unnecessarily political and punitive retaliation from their state leaders,” said Dan Domenech, executive director of AASA, the School Superintendents Association. “Superintendents bear the ultimate responsibility and accountability for those decisions, and AASA will always support the leadership decisions of superintendents on behalf of their districts, students, and staff. We applaud Project SAFE in its work to support school districts where leaders are making the best decisions for their students, staff, and community despite objectionable state obstacles.” Educators, leaders, and parents are working hand-in-hand in communities across the nation to keep students and school communities safe—and the Biden Administration will do everything it can to support them doing right by children. The Biden Administration remains committed to supporting educators as they work to return to in-person learning safely, and the President’s plan makes clear we will take on those working to block or undermine these efforts. Other school districts that have had a financial penalty imposed by their state for implementing CDC-recommended strategies to prevent the spread of COVID-19 can learn more about Project SAFE and apply for funds from the program at https://oese.ed.gov/offices/office-of-formula-grants/safe-supportive-schools/the-project-to-support-americas-families-and-educators-project-safe/ ."
23-Sep-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-announces-fiscal-year-2021-grant-awards-showcase-commitment-equity-excellence-and-opportunity,"U.S. Department of Education Announces Fiscal Year 2021 Grant Awards to Showcase Commitment to Equity, Excellence, and Opportunity","Today, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) Office of Postsecondary Education (OPE) announced it is on track to award more than 5,100 grants, totaling around $2.6 billion dollars, to new and existing grantees by September 30, 2021. Grants provided by the Department under these programs will directly serve more than 1.3 million students and millions more attending institutions with approved projects. The grant programs are diverse and unique but share the same objective to address critical challenges that impede students’ postsecondary opportunity and success. These grants are in addition to the nearly $40 billion in emergency grants for postsecondary education provided to more than 5,000 institutions under the American Rescue Plan (ARP) Act. U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona announced the grants during his visit to Saginaw Chippewa Tribal College in Michigan as part of the Department’s Return to School Road Trip. ""Through these federal grants, the Department is furthering its mission to expand access to opportunity at every level of our education system. These grants serve a variety of purposes—from increasing students' readiness for postsecondary education to bolstering the capacity of colleges,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""While each of these programs is unique, together they share the important aim of advancing equity in education and helping every student with dreams and determination to achieve their potential. I'm proud to make this announcement as I visit a tribal college as part of the Department's Return to School Road Trip, celebrating schools and institutions welcoming students back to in-person learning this fall."" The grants announced today reaffirm the Department’s commitment to equity and educational access across the postsecondary spectrum, geographic region, and college type. Many of the grantees are institutions of higher education that have been historically under-served, under-resourced, and often expected to do more with less. Supporting Minority Serving Institutions The Department will award more than 300 grants in FY2021 to help build the academic capacity and fiscal stability of institutions that enroll large proportions of minority and financially disadvantaged students. Minority-serving institutions serve significant proportions of our nation’s Black, Latino, Native American, and Asian American and Pacific Islander students and strengthen the cultural and economic forces that fuel our national and local communities. The Department invested close to $1 billion in the nation’s most under-resourced institutions and communities, including more than $500 million to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), more than $65 million to Tribally Controlled Colleges and Universities (TCCU), nearly $300 million to Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs)—the majority of which are Hispanic Serving Institutions—and more than $100 million to under-resourced institutions eligible for the Strengthening Institutions Programs. These funds are in addition to the billions of dollars already awarded to hundreds of HBCU, TCCU, and MSI institutions to support pandemic recovery efforts through the American Rescue Plan. Supporting low-income, first-generation students and individuals with high needs The Department also announced grants to help students progress through the academic pipeline from middle school to graduate school, in addition to programs focused on college readiness, campus-based childcare and graduate fellowships. Grants awarded in FY2021 include: More than $1 billion for current and new grantees under the TRIO programs to help low-income, first-generation, and disabled students navigate the academic pipeline from middle school to postbaccalaureate programs. More than $360 million awarded to over 150 partnerships and states participating in Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs (GEAR UP), which is designed to increase the number of low-income students who are prepared to enter and succeed in postsecondary education. Over $22 million awarded in Child Care Access Means Parents in Schools (CCAMPIS) grants, which provide support to student parents to complete their degrees, pursue careers, and lift themselves and their families out of poverty. More than $10 million to provide inclusive opportunities for students with intellectual disabilities through the Transition Programs for Students with Intellectual Disabilities and the National Technical Assistance Coordinating Center. More than $20 million in new awards through the Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need (GAANN) program to support academically successful graduate students of low-income backgrounds in courses of study in a field designated as an area of national need. Nearly $14 million to institutions to support veteran student success and develop low or no-cost open educational resources, such as textbooks and course materials, to students. Global competitiveness The Department is awarding an additional $76.6 million to new and existing grantees to fund programs in FY2021 that support global competencies, multilingual communication, and cultural engagement to strengthen U.S. capacity to meet ever-evolving national security needs. Some of these innovative projects also provide students with a broader understanding of and exposure to the global business opportunities available in today’s industries. These programs showcase the Department’s ongoing and concerted efforts to establish priorities that expand learning, equitable opportunities, and career training opportunities for all students, especially those who have been under-served. Through support of historically under-resourced institutions and funding programs that focus on college readiness and postsecondary success, the Department is doubling down on its goal of resilience, equitable recovery and ensuring that our nation’s colleges and universities can build back better.

Grantees and total funding will be updated through November on each program website ."
22-Sep-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-announces-over-40-million-new-cohort-promise-neighborhoods-grantees,U.S. Department of Education Announces Over $40 Million to New Cohort of Promise Neighborhoods Grantees,"The U.S. Department of Education today awarded over $40 million to the newest cohort of Promise Neighborhoods grantees across seven states. This announcement comes as U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona continues the Department’s “Return to School Road Trip” in Indiana today. “Promise Neighborhoods build on the rich resources, ingenuity, and creativity of communities to bring together schools, nonprofits, and other organizations in a concerted effort to meet the needs of children and youth,” said Secretary Cardona. “Through these new grants, we are announcing today, more children in communities all across the nation will have access to cradle-to-college and career supports that will help them reach their potential and thrive.” Authorized under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), as amended, the Promise Neighborhoods Program is intended to significantly improve academic and developmental outcomes for children living in communities of concentrated poverty. The program does this by enabling education and community leaders to address the many interlocking impacts that concentrated poverty exerts on a child’s educational journey. Grantees’ applications proposed pipelines of programs and services developed specifically for the students in their communities. These services will support students from early childhood through the course of their K-12 education. The Department made awards to seven grantees: The South Ward Children’s Alliance of Newark, New Jersey, will expand the reach of its current Promise Neighborhoods initiative to two additional South Newark neighborhoods. The John H. Boner Community Center of Indianapolis, Indiana, will build out its comprehensive home visit program and assign students college and career coaches to help them explore post-secondary education pathways. The Lancaster County Partners for Youth in Lancaster, South Carolina, will expand its Baby College program and create a new, comprehensive out of-school-time program that infuses academics and enrichment, and serves elementary, middle, and high school students. Klamath River Promise, located on Yurok tribal lands in California, will target historically high rates of chronic absenteeism by hiring part-time attendance specialists for each of the schools in its Promise Neighborhood. Delta Health Alliance of Leland, Mississippi, has already doubled kindergarten readiness at its two existing Mississippi Promise Neighborhoods and will integrate 24 new evidence-based school, family, and community programs into its existing cradle-to career pipelines. The Broward Up Promise Neighborhood, in Broward County, Florida, has engaged partners to specifically serve students experiencing homelessness, foster-care involved youth, teenaged parents, and students who have been exposed to the juvenile justice system. Connecticut Children’s of Hartford will collaboratively design, implement, and evaluate the North Hartford Ascend Pipeline, a comprehensive prenatal through career pipeline that significantly improves the academic and developmental outcomes of children and their long-term well-being and quality of life. President Biden’s FY22 budget includes a $10 million proposed increase for Promise Neighborhoods to reflect the Administration’s priority on expanding community-school partnerships to better meet the comprehensive needs of underserved communities."

The recognition is based on a school's overall academic performance or progress in closing achievement gaps among student subgroups. Secretary Cardona will make the announcement during his Return to School Road Trip , where he will visit an awardee school, Walter R. Sundling Jr. High School, in Palatine, Illinois. ""This year's cohort of honorees demonstrates what is possible when committed educators and school leaders create vibrant, welcoming, and affirming school cultures where rich teaching and learning can flourish,"" said Secretary Cardona. ""I commend this school and all our Blue Ribbon honorees for working to keep students healthy and safe while meeting their academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs. In the face of unprecedented circumstances, you found creative ways to engage, care for, protect, and teach our children. Blue Ribbon Schools have so much to offer and can serve as a model for other schools and communities so that we can truly build back better."" The coveted National Blue Ribbon Schools award affirms the hard work of educators, families and communities in creating safe and welcoming schools where students master challenging and engaging content. Now in its 39th year, the National Blue Ribbon Schools Program has bestowed approximately 10,000 awards to more than 9,000 schools. The Education Department recognizes all schools in one of two performance categories, based on all student scores, subgroup student scores and graduation rates: Exemplary High-Performing Schools are among their state's highest performing schools as measured by state assessments or nationally normed tests. Exemplary Achievement Gap-Closing Schools are among their state's highest performing schools in closing achievement gaps between a school's student groups and all students. Up to 420 schools may be nominated each year. The Department invites National Blue Ribbon Schools nominations from the top education official in all states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the Department of Defense Education Activity, and the Bureau of Indian Education. Private schools are nominated by the Council for American Private Education.

The students come from more than 18,750 public, private, and military schools from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, and American military bases abroad. ""President Biden and I are thrilled to recognize this year's honorees and celebrate their accomplishments with the nation, along with their families, teachers, and communities who helped them along their educational journey, said Secretary Cardona. ""For all the hardships and heartache over the last school year, I firmly believe that we, as a country—and this rising generation—can emerge from this challenging time even stronger. The President's Education Award Program honorees have forged opportunity out of crisis and drawn on their resolve, their ingenuity, and their tireless optimism to excel."" PEAP was founded in 1983. Every year since then, the program has provided our nation's schools with the opportunity to recognize graduating students who meet high standards of academic excellence and those who have given their best effort, often overcoming obstacles to their learning. Each year, eligible graduating K-12 students are selected by their school principals for recognition in two categories: The President's Award for Educational Excellence —This award recognizes academic success in the classroom. To be eligible, students must meet requirements, including grade point average or other school-set criteria and choice of state tests or teacher recommendations. The President's Award for Educational Achievement —This award recognizes students who show outstanding educational growth, improvement, commitment, or intellectual development in their academic subjects but do not meet the criteria for the Educational Excellence Award. Its purpose is to encourage and reward students who give their best effort, often in the face of obstacles. Criteria for this award are developed at each school. Individual recognition is bestowed by the President and the U.S. Secretary of Education, in partnership with the National Association of Elementary School Principals and the National Association of Secondary School Principals. The award includes a congratulatory letter to the student and a certificate signed by the President, the Secretary, and the school principal. Unlike other awards programs, the principal has sole discretion in choosing recipients based on eligibility. There is no limit on the number of awards as long as students meet the criteria for each award set by the school. Despite the uncertainty and challenges related to COVID-19, the program continued to accept and fulfill nominations so that student recognition could continue. A list of schools, by state and territory, participating in the President's Education Awards is available here ."
15-Sep-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-announces-new-actions-improve-educational-outcomes-students-puerto-rico,U.S. Department of Education Announces New Actions to Improve Educational Outcomes for Students In Puerto Rico,"WASHINGTON — Today, U.S. Department of Education Secretary Miguel Cardona met with Puerto Rico Interim Secretary of Education Eliezer Ramos to discuss new actions to improve educational outcomes for students. After today's meeting, the Department announced the formation of the Puerto Rico Education Sustainability (PRES) Team whose purpose is to provide comprehensive support for Puerto Rico, including coordination with stakeholders that assists the Puerto Rico Department of Education (PRDE) and institutions of higher education in strengthening the stewardship of federal funds and helping improve educational outcomes for students. ""It was just over two months ago when I met with Secretary Ramos in Puerto Rico and we began talking about the collaborative work that we envisioned to serve students in Puerto Rico. I am happy to share that we haven't stopped working since that trip and today we're highlighting another milestone of that effort,"" said Secretary Cardona. ""We will work together as partners—for students, for their success, and for the future of Puerto Rico."" ""I have to thank Secretary Cardona and President Biden for this. This is a major change in the relationship between the United States Department of Education and the Puerto Rico Department of Education,"" said Puerto Rico Interim Secretary of Education Eliezer Ramos. ""We have the same goals, and this collaborative effort will move forward the agenda of the students and teachers of Puerto Rico."" The team has started initial work collaborating with the PRDE and identified three key priority areas: Financial responsibility, with the goal of PRDE regaining financial management authority of their federal funds; Safe and healthy school buildings, working with partners to provide technical assistance as the PRDE continues school infrastructure improvements; and Program support, continuing to support PRDE in their use of American Rescue Plan (ARP) and other federal pandemic recovery funds, along with bolstered technical assistance for high-quality instruction and programs and improved implementation of major formula grant programs. Students in Puerto Rico have faced significant challenges in the aftermath of Hurricanes Irma and Maria, school closures, multiple earthquakes, and the COVID-19 pandemic. These compounding events have significantly impacted instruction for students on the island. In response, Secretary Cardona visited Puerto Rico in June 2021 to meet with stakeholders and hear about the challenges with reopening schools and discuss opportunities for partnership. During this visit, Secretary Cardona also announced the release of federal education pandemic relief funds and other education program dollars for the Commonwealth. The Department has continued building on previous work to better understand the critical needs of the PRDE as it serves over 260,000 students on the island. As of July 2021, the Department has released nearly $5 billion to Puerto Rico including: $2 billion from the American Rescue Plan Act; $1.2 billion from the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2021 (CRRSA); $662 million in FY 2020 program grants; and $912 million in federal education funds, which had not been available to Puerto Rico as a result of previously imposed grant conditions. In the near term, the Department will deploy a team to the island to work hand in hand with the PRDE and partners, continue listening sessions, and address immediate support needs. Additionally, the PRES team will work with PRDE to ensure progress continues as Puerto Rico deploys recovery funds recently made available by the Department. The unprecedented volume of grant funds and unique infrastructure challenges in Puerto Rico are a priority to support student learning needs. The Department intends to refine and assess the effectiveness of these efforts, so they can be adapted to our support for other grantees where it might also be helpful."

The tour now includes a stop in South Bend, Indiana and no longer includes a stop in Kendallville, Indiana. On Monday, Sept. 20, U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona will launch the “Return to School Road Trip,” a bus tour to showcase students and communities safely returning to in-person learning. Throughout the tour, Secretary Cardona, Deputy Secretary Cindy Marten, and local school leaders will join students, parents, educators, and school communities for events that highlight schools and communities that have safely welcomed students back to in-person learning. The “Return to School Road Trip” will feature stops in: Eau Claire, Madison, and Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Palatine and Chicago, Illinois; South Bend, Indiana; Toledo, Ohio; and Mt. Pleasant, Lansing, Detroit, and Canton, Michigan. Secretary Cardona will visit students from pre-kindergarten through higher education, highlighting how students, families, and the educators and staff who serve them across the country are excited and ready for safe in-person learning this fall. “The best part of fall is welcoming students back for a new school year, and I’m thrilled to be traveling across the Midwest to celebrate the return to safe in-person learning,” said Secretary Cardona. “The return to school this year is more special than ever, after many of our nation’s students have been disconnected from their peers, educators, classrooms, school communities and learning routines for over a year. I’m excited to kick off our Return to School Road Trip next week, where we will meet with students of all ages, dedicated educators and school staff, and community leaders doing critical work to bring students back to in-person learning safely this fall.” Last month, the Department released its “ Return to School Roadmap, ” a resource to support students, schools, educators, and communities as they prepare to return to safe, healthy in-person learning and emerge from the pandemic stronger than before. The Roadmap includes three “Landmark” priorities that schools, districts, and communities are encouraged to focus on to ensure all students are set up for success in the 2021-2022 school year. These include: (1) prioritizing the health and safety of students, staff, and educators, (2) building school communities and supporting students’ social, emotional, and mental health, and (3) accelerating academic achievement. Many of the schools and communities featured in the tour have successfully implemented the priorities within the Roadmap and have used federal pandemic relief funds to support these efforts. The American Rescue Plan provided more than $130 billion in K-12 emergency relief funds that can be used to support the safe return to in-person learning, including by improving ventilation systems, encouraging vaccinations, performing testing and contact tracing, and using CDC-recommended strategies like universal indoor masking; as well as address the academic, social, emotional and mental health needs of students. Additionally, the American Rescue Plan provided $40 billion in relief funds to institutions of higher education to provide direct relief to students and support the safe reopening of colleges and universities across the country. The Road Trip will highlight how those resources have enabled communities to bring students back into classrooms where they can reengage with their classmates and teachers, participate in extracurriculars, and access the critical social, emotional, and mental health supports that schools provide. In addition to the Roadmap and the passage of the American Rescue Plan, the Biden Administration has taken a series of steps to help schools and communities recover from the pandemic and build back better: Prioritizing vaccine access for school staff, by issuing a directive making teachers eligible in March, setting a goal of getting all school staff who wanted the vaccination to be able to get at least one shot in the month of March, and resulting in about 90% of educators vaccinated today. Expanding access to the vaccine for young people, by issuing a call to school districts to host on-site, with collaboration from Health and Human Services , pop-up vaccination clinics at schools, in partnership with the federal pharmacy program; and incorporating COVID-19 vaccination into sports physicals for student athletes. Requiring staff in Head Start programs, Department of Defense schools, and Bureau of Indian Education-operated schools to be vaccinated.

Maine’s plan details how the state is using and plans to use ARP ESSER funds to safely reopen and sustain the safe operation of schools and equitably expand opportunity for students who need it most, particularly those most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. As schools and states begin the new school year, the Department released the Return to School Roadmap , which provides key resources and supports for students, parents, educators, and school communities to build excitement around returning to classrooms this school year and outlines how federal funding can support the safe and sustained return to in-person learning. ARP funds can be used to support the Roadmap’s efforts. Earlier this year, the Department distributed two-thirds of the ARP ESSER funds, totaling $81 billion, to 50 states and the District of Columbia. The remaining third of the funding to states will be made available once state plans are approved. Maine is receiving more than $411 million total in ARP ESSER funds, and today’s approval of their plan will result in the release of the final $137 million. Additionally, the Department approved plans for Idaho, Nevada, and North Carolina. Today’s approvals mean a total of 37 ARP ESSER state plans have been approved since June. The Department has approved plans supporting more than 50 percent of students nationwide. “I am excited to announce approval of Maine’s plan,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “It is heartening to see, reflected in these state plans, the ways in which states are thinking deeply about how to use American Rescue Plan funds to continue to provide critical support to schools and communities, particularly as we look ahead to the upcoming academic year. The approval of these plans enables states to receive vital, additional American Rescue Plan funds to quickly and safely reopen schools for full-time, in-person learning; meet students’ academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs; and address disparities in access to educational opportunity that were exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. The state plans that have been submitted to the Department lay the groundwork for the ways in which an unprecedented infusion of federal resources will be used to address the urgent needs of America’s children and build back better.” “The team at Maine Department of Education is thrilled that our plan has received approval from the U.S. Department of Education and that we can now begin approving school administrative unit plans for use of the ARP funds,” said Maine Commissioner of Education Pender Makin. “These funds will support state-level efforts to propel our education system forward with a whole child focus, and will assist schools with innovative programming to address the academic and social-emotional needs of students while ensuring that they are learning in an environment that is safe and healthy.” The ARP ESSER state plans approved by the Department today, including Maine, show how states are using federal pandemic resources to support safe in-person instruction and meet the social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs of students—with a focus on the students most impacted by the pandemic. For example: Safely Reopening Schools and Sustaining Safe Operations: Maine’s COVID-19 Response vaccination website provides hundreds of vaccination sites through health-care centers, pharmacies, and mobile vaccination units. Several Maine School Administrative Units (SAUs) also served as vaccination sites in the spring of 2021, and this fall many are working with local providers to host COVID-19 vaccine clinics for age eligible students and staff. Maine Department of Education (MDOE) is providing additional support for clinics to 12 SAUs. At no cost to them, each SAU or school can opt into the voluntary Pooled PCR Testing Program. To date, 360 schools have opted into the program. Addressing the Academic Impact of Lost Instructional Time: MDOE’s Extended Learning Program will develop opportunities for students across the state to engage with local industry employers. The program will allow students to gain knowledge and skills through learning and credit recovery in community-based and work-based organizations through the academic year. The Maine Online Opportunities for Sustained Education Learning Module Library provides free access to asynchronous, interdisciplinary, project-based learning modules aligned to the Maine Learning Results for PreK-12. Additionally, Learning Management System subgrants are available to SAUs to plan, execute, and assess specific learning processes and provide personalized approaches to education. Staffing to Support Students’ Needs : MDOE partnered with the Maine Community College System to launch the Learning Facilitators Program, a fast-track training program for paraprofessional level educators to expand, strengthen and support the educator workforce and enables program participants to earn educational certifications at no cost. Over 100 educators completed coursework and secured placements. MDOE will continue this program in the 2021-22 school year and is exploring an expansion of this program with ARP funds. A total of 49 states, and the District of Columbia, have submitted their ARP ESSER state plans to the Department. The Department is reviewing the plans expeditiously and is in contact with states to ensure their plans meet all necessary requirements in order to access the remaining funds, as outlined in the ARP. The distribution of ARP ESSER funds is part of the Department’s broader effort to support students and districts as they work to reengage students impacted by the pandemic, address inequities exacerbated by COVID-19, and build our education system back better than before.

Idaho’s plan details how the state is using and plans to use ARP ESSER funds to safely reopen and sustain the safe operation of schools and equitably expand opportunity for students who need it most, particularly those most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. As schools and states begin the new school year, the Department released the Return to School Roadmap , which provides key resources and supports for students, parents, educators, and school communities to build excitement around returning to classrooms this school year and outlines how federal funding can support the safe and sustained return to in-person learning. ARP funds can be used to support the Roadmap’s efforts. Earlier this year, the Department distributed two-thirds of the ARP ESSER funds, totaling $81 billion, to 50 states and the District of Columbia. The remaining third of the funding to states will be made available once state plans are approved. Idaho is receiving $440 million total in ARP ESSER funds, and today’s approval of their plan will result in the release of the final $146 million. Additionally, the Department approved plans for Maine, Nevada, and North Carolina. Today’s approvals mean a total of 37 ARP ESSER state plans have been approved since June. The Department has approved plans supporting more than 50 percent of students nationwide. “I am excited to announce approval of Idaho’s plan,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “It is heartening to see, reflected in these state plans, the ways in which states are thinking deeply about how to use American Rescue Plan funds to continue to provide critical support to schools and communities, particularly as we look ahead to the upcoming academic year. The approval of these plans enables states to receive vital, additional American Rescue Plan funds to quickly and safely reopen schools for full-time, in-person learning; meet students’ academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs; and address disparities in access to educational opportunity that were exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. The state plans that have been submitted to the Department lay the groundwork for the ways in which an unprecedented infusion of federal resources will be used to address the urgent needs of America’s children and build back better.” “I am pleased that Idaho’s plan has been approved by the U.S. Department of Education. The plan will ensure that our schools and districts receive the funding they need to address unfinished learning, behavioral health challenges and other impacts from the pandemic,” Superintendent of Public Instruction Sherri Ybarra said. “Throughout this process, we’ve placed high priority on giving districts and schools both the resources and flexibility to address local needs, as well as assistance identifying and engaging the students most impacted by the pandemic so that we can get them back on track.” “We are very pleased that the U.S. Department of Education has approved our ARP ESSER plan, freeing up an additional $146 million to help Idaho address the statewide problem of unfinished learning as a result of the pandemic,” said Kurt Liebich, president, Idaho State Board of Education. “I’d like to thank Superintendent Ybarra and the teams both at the State Department of Education and the State Board of Education for their work and collaboration on developing the Idaho plan that meets requirements set forth by the U.S. Department of Education. Idaho joins 36 other states with approved plans. The Board and the State Department are focused on three priorities: K-4 literacy, grades 5-9 math, and credit recovery for high school students. We look forward to working with school districts and charter schools as they work to develop their local plans and put them into action. These federal resources will go a long way in helping our students recover what they lost because of the massive disruption the pandemic caused to our education system.” The ARP ESSER state plans approved by the Department today, including Idaho, show how states are using federal pandemic resources to support safe in-person instruction and meet the social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs of students—with a focus on the students most impacted by the pandemic. For example: Supporting Students Most Impacted by the Pandemic: Idaho will provide school districts and charter schools with professional development resources on using attendance and absenteeism data, as well as other student achievement indicators, to identify students who missed the most instruction during the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 school years. Idaho will support school districts in using a tiered system of support to improve student attendance and engagement. Addressing the Academic Impact of Lost Instructional Time: Idaho will use statewide data to identify evidence-based interventions for districts, which could include high-dosage tutoring, extended learning time interventions (during or before and after school), and acceleration academies (focused instruction in one subject during vacation breaks), and instructional techniques, beginning the summer of 2021 and carrying through the next few years. Use of State Emergency Funds: Idaho will use a portion of state reserve funds from the Emergency Fund to support rural districts and the Bureau of Educational Services for the Deaf and the Blind to implement accelerated learning strategies. A total of 49 states, and the District of Columbia, have submitted their ARP ESSER state plans to the Department. The Department is reviewing the plans expeditiously and is in contact with states to ensure their plans meet all necessary requirements in order to access the remaining funds, as outlined in the ARP. The distribution of ARP ESSER funds is part of the Department’s broader effort to support students and districts as they work to reengage students impacted by the pandemic, address inequities exacerbated by COVID-19, and build our education system back better than before. In addition to providing $130 billion for K-12 education in the American Rescue Plan to support the safe reopening of K-12 schools and meet the needs of all students, the Biden-Harris Administration also has: Launched the Return to School Roadmap to provide key resources and supports for students, parents, educators, and school communities to build excitement around returning to classrooms this school year and outline how federal funding can support the safe and sustained return to in-person learning Released three volumes of the COVID-19 Handbook Held a National Safe School Reopening Summit Prioritized the vaccination of educators, school staff and child care workers.

The newly-established Office of Learning Recovery and Acceleration is prepared to direct these funds in ways that will support teachers, uplift students, and engage our community so we can foster a resilient recovery, where students are presented with better outcomes and new opportunities.” “This pandemic has placed a remarkable strain on our students, educators, schools, and families,” said Rep. Deborah Ross. “Congress and the Biden-Harris Administration responded by passing the American Rescue Plan, providing billions of dollars in unprecedented relief to our K-12 schools so they may reopen safely and expand opportunities for students who need it most. I am glad to see the Department of Education approve North Carolina’s plan, and I look forward to working with officials at the local, state, and federal level to ensure the continued success of our students and educators.” The ARP ESSER state plans approved by the Department today, including North Carolina, show how states are using federal pandemic resources to support safe in-person instruction and meet the social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs of students—with a focus on the students most impacted by the pandemic. For example: Addressing the Academic Impact of Lost Instructional Time: The North Carolina Department of Public Instruction (NCDPI) will consider specific evidence-based interventions, including $30,000,000 for high-impact tutoring statewide, $19,000,000 for a competency-based assessment and platform to be used across the state, and $35,000,000 for a competitive grant program for school extensions. < Staffing to Support Students’ Needs: The Office of Learning Recovery and Acceleration is working with health-care professionals to improve health and educational outcomes for children in North Carolina. The team is currently working to expand an existing model that provides elementary schools with access to pediatricians via telehealth technologies. Early indications show this telehealth option reduces barriers to care for students resulting in improved health outcomes for children, reduced chronic absenteeism, and a decrease in the impact of health-care related costs on parents or caregivers. A total of 49 states, and the District of Columbia, have submitted their ARP ESSER state plans to the Department. The Department is reviewing the plans expeditiously and is in contact with states to ensure their plans meet all necessary requirements in order to access the remaining funds, as outlined in the ARP.

Catherine Cortez Masto. “Addressing the mental health crisis affecting our kids has been a top priority for me, and Nevada’s plans demonstrate the state’s commitment to supporting students in and outside of the classroom. I’m so pleased to see these plans for using this money have been approved by the Department of Education, so these dollars can get into our communities and support our students.” “Prior to coming to Congress, I spent my career working in education, and I know just how tough this pandemic has been on our students and teachers,” said Rep. Susie Lee. “I was proud to vote to pass the American Rescue Plan, which included robust funding for schools, and now—thanks to that funding—our kids are safely back in school. But there is so much work to be done to support students, both socially and academically, after a year of distance learning. I’m so glad to see that Nevada will be receiving these funds to help address learning loss and get our students the resources they need to succeed.” “Nevada’s students, teachers, and families have faced unprecedented hardship from the COVID-19 pandemic—but today, help is here. The Biden-Harris Administration and Congress secured much-needed education relief funding through the American Rescue Plan, and I am glad to see the Department of Education approve Nevada’s plan to use these funds,” said Rep. Steven Horsford. “Nevada’s ESSER III allocation will help us keep students safe and address the learning loss of the past year, which has taken a disproportionate toll on students of color, students with special education needs, English language learners, and those in rural and low-income communities.” “This pandemic has created unprecedented challenges for students, educators, and parents in Southern Nevada,” said Rep. Dina Titus. “We need to ensure these critical funds provided by Congress in the American Rescue Plan will provide Nevada schools the resources they need to help students safely return to in-person learning, address learning loss in disadvantaged communities, and provide wrap-around services for underserved students disproportionately impacted by COVID-19.” The ARP ESSER state plans approved by the Department today, including Nevada, show how states are using federal pandemic resources to support safe in-person instruction and meet the social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs of students—with a focus on the students most impacted by the pandemic. For example: Safely Reopening Schools and Sustaining Safe Operations: For the 2021-2022 school year, the Nevada Department of Education (NDE) provided guidance and resources to ensure safe and welcoming learning environments for all students and maximized opportunities for in-person learning. In addition to detailing emergency plans for distance education in their reopening plans, Nevada districts continue to promote vaccinations among teachers, staff, families, and eligible students by providing information about COVID-19 vaccination, encouraging vaccine trust and confidence, and establishing supportive policies and practices that make getting vaccinated as easy and convenient as possible. Investing in Expanded Afterschool Programs: NDE will award $10.7 million in funds reserved for afterschool programs to districts through a competitive grant process that ensures afterschool programs are evidence-based and address the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on traditionally underserved student groups. Based on stakeholder feedback and data, the afterschool programs will support early learning, instructional support, credit recovery, and social and emotional support for students. Supporting Students’ and Educators’ Social, Emotional, and Mental Health Needs: NDE will allocate $7.5 million to support districts and charter schools in hiring 100 additional school-based mental health professionals, including school counselors, school social workers, school psychologists, and school mental health workers. Additionally, NDE will spend $1.7 million to hire a Multi-Tiered System of Support coach for every district.

The announcement is part of President Biden's plan to combat COVID-19 and protect the health and safety of students, educators, families, and school communities. Educators, leaders, and parents are working hand in hand in communities across the nation to protect schoolchildren returning to in-person learning, and the Biden Administration will do everything it can to support them doing right by kids. The new grant program, Project SAFE (Supporting America's Families and Educators), anticipates using funding within the Department of Education from Title IV, Part F, School Safety National Activities, of the Every Student Succeeds Act. Local school districts would be able to apply for Project SAFE grants that will allow them to restore funding withheld by state leaders—such as for school board members or superintendents who have had their pay cut—when a school district implemented strategies to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in schools. This funding will help districts improve student safety and well-being by advancing strategies to reduce transmission of COVID-19 in schools. ""Every student across the country deserves the opportunity to return to school in-person safely this fall, and every family should be confident that their school is implementing policies that keep their children safe,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""We should be thanking districts for using proven strategies that will keep schools open and safe, not punishing them. We stand with the dedicated educators doing the right thing to protect their school communities, and this program will allow them to continue that critical work of keeping students safe."" The Department intends to release a Notice Inviting Applications for school districts to apply for the Project SAFE grant opportunity in the coming weeks and plans to make grant awards as expeditiously as possible and on an ongoing basis. The Department will make grant awards directly to local education agencies. In addition to the new grant program administered by the Department of Education, President Biden's plan includes actions to ensure schools can remain open for in-person learning and maintain the health and safety of students, staff, and families. This includes calling on all states to adopt vaccine mandates for all school employees, encouraging schools to use American Rescue Plan and other federal funds to regularly test students and school staff for COVID-19, and using the Department of Education's full legal authority to protect students' access to in-person instruction. As part of the American Rescue Plan, states and school districts were provided $122 billion in funds aimed at supporting the safe and sustained reopening of schools across the country."

Today, President Joe Biden, U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona and the White House Initiative on Historically Black Colleges and Universities invite institution leaders, faculty, students, and supporters to the 2021 National HBCU Week Conference to be held virtually September 7-10th. The annual National HBCU Week Conference is the nation's premier convening of key influencers in the HBCU space. This year's conference theme is ""Exploring Equity."" In his Executive Order on Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government, President Biden said, ""Equal opportunity is the bedrock of American democracy, and our diversity is one of our country's greatest strengths.But for too many, the American Dream remains out of reach."" In response to President Biden's Executive Order, federal agencies were charged with evaluating opportunities to increase coordination, communication, and engagement with HBCUs. Next week’s conference will focus on program opportunities from many of those federal partners. ""HBCUs are engines of opportunity, social mobility, and economic prosperity for the students they serve. Since their founding, these vital institutions have played a crucial role in educating students to lead thriving lives and in reversing long-standing inequities across systems in America. To build back better we need HBCUs,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""And importantly, equity and excellence are in HBCUs' institutional DNA. HBCUs serve students of color of all backgrounds from across the nation – including families and communities that historically have been furthest from opportunity and that most stand to benefit from education's potential to bring the American Dream within reach."" The National HBCU Week Conference is coordinated by the White House Initiative on HBCUs in close consultation with the Executive Office of the President and the U.S. Department of Education. The event provides an opportunity for federal agencies, private sector companies and philanthropic organizations to convene and provide useful information and successful models to improve instruction, degree completion and federal engagement, all of which strengthen the role of HBCUs.

31-Aug-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/new-resource-details-evidence-based-strategies-address-impact-lost-instructional-time-using-american-rescue-plan-funding,New Resource Details Evidence-Based Strategies to Address Impact of Lost Instructional Time by Using American Rescue Plan Funding,"Students across the country continue to return to in-person learning after more than a year of varied access to the educational opportunities they need to succeed. For example, some estimates show that 3 million students have either been consistently absent from or have not been actively participating in remote learning since the beginning of the pandemic. Today, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) released “Strategies for Using American Rescue Plan Funding to Address the Impact of Lost Instructional Time,” a resource to support educators as they implement, refine, and work to continuously improve their strategies for supporting students. We know that across the country the hard work of supporting students through this pandemic has been long underway. This guidance is intended to lift up these best practices and evidence-based approaches, all of which can be supported with American Rescue Plan (ARP) funds. The new resource on lost instructional time is part of the Department’s Return to School Roadmap , a guide for states, schools, educators, and parents to prepare for the return to in-person learning this fall. The Roadmap focuses on three landmark priorities, including building school communities and supporting students’ social, emotional, and mental health. In March, the Department announced allocations to each state educational agency under the ARP Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) fund, totaling $122 billion in relief for K-12 schools. Under ARP ESSER funding, districts are directed to use at least 20% of their funds to address the impact of lost instructional using evidence-based interventions. Each section of the Roadmap provides strategies, resources, and tools for meeting the needs of underserved students by: Building trust with families and supporting safe in-person learning Supporting students’ social, emotional, and mental-health needs Utilizing approaches for accelerated learning, including high-quality tutoring Supporting students during key transitions and their reengagement in learning Using high-quality assessments to support student learning “Our country’s students—particularly our students of color, students from low-income backgrounds, students experiencing homelessness, students with disabilities, and multilingual learners—have faced immense challenges amid the pandemic, especially with regard to lost instructional time,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “Nationally, we know that disparities in access to educational opportunity—including access to rich, rigorous learning experiences; talented and diverse teachers; school counselors and high-quality social-emotional supports; and safe, welcoming schools existed long before COVID-19. Our work as a nation must be to eliminate these disparities, and we must do so with urgency. Our students don’t have a moment to wait. I’m proud that these new resources will help states and districts to accelerate learning, especially for those students who need the most additional support.” While the pandemic has impacted all students, it has deepened pre-pandemic disparities in access and opportunities for students of color, multilingual learners, students with disabilities, LGBTQ+ students. Schools can use ARP ESSER funds to respond to the urgent needs of students, address gaps in educational opportunity, and build local capacity to sustain meaningful and effective teaching and learning. In June, the Department’s Office for Civil Rights published Education in a Pandemic: The Disparate Impacts of COVID-19 on America’s Students , in response to President Biden’s Executive Order on Supporting the Reopening and Continuing Operation of Schools and Early Childhood Education Providers. The report explores how the impacts of COVID-19 are falling disproportionately on students who went into the pandemic with the fewest educational opportunities, many of whom are from marginalized and underserved communities. In April, the Department released the COVID-19 Handbook, Volume 2: Roadmap to Reopening Safely and Meeting All Students’ Needs , which includes strategies for using ARP ESSER funds to address the impact of COVID-19 on students, educators, staff, and families, including meeting students’ basic needs (including food security); creating safe and inclusive learning environments; accelerating students learning through instructional approaches, tutoring, and expanded learning time; increasing educational opportunity; and stabilizing and supporting the educator and staff workforce. The resource released today is a complement to Volume 2. Today’s release of “Strategies for Using American Rescue Plan Funding to Address the Impact of Lost Instructional Time” is part of a series of steps the Biden Administration has taken to help schools recover from the pandemic and build back better. In addition to issuing this resource, the Department has: Released a Return to School Roadmap , which provides resources and local examples to support states, districts, and schools in reopening efforts. Prioritized the vaccination of educators, school staff, and child care workers, including through school-based vaccination clinics supported by pharmacy partnerships. Published a Safer Schools and Best Practices Clearinghouse , which includes over 200 examples of schools and communities safely returning to in-person learning. Held a National Safe School Reopening Summit . Provided $122 billion in support through the American Rescue Plan Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund for K-12 schools. Released over $3 billion in IDEA funds within the American Rescue Plan to support children and families with disabilities impacted by the pandemic. Released $800 million within the American Rescue Plan to support students experiencing homelessness who have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. Released a report on the disparate impacts of COVID-19 on underserved students. Launched an Equity Summit Series focused on addressing school and district inequities that existed before, but were made worse by the pandemic Awarded nearly $40 billion in funding for institutions of higher education within the American Rescue Plan, about half of which will provide direct aid to students at postsecondary institutions. The Department will continue providing robust resources to schools and communities as they work to recover from the pandemic and address inequities exacerbated by the pandemic."
30-Aug-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/department-educations-office-civil-rights-opens-investigations-five-states-regarding-prohibitions-universal-indoor-masking,Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights Opens Investigations in Five States Regarding Prohibitions of Universal Indoor Masking,"Today, the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) opened directed investigations in five states exploring whether statewide prohibitions on universal indoor masking discriminate against students with disabilities who are at heightened risk for severe illness from COVID-19 by preventing them from safely accessing in-person education. ""The Department has heard from parents from across the country – particularly parents of students with disabilities and with underlying medical conditions – about how state bans on universal indoor masking are putting their children at risk and preventing them from accessing in-person learning equally,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""It's simply unacceptable that state leaders are putting politics over the health and education of the students they took an oath to serve. The Department will fight to protect every student's right to access in-person learning safely and the rights of local educators to put in place policies that allow all students to return to the classroom full-time in-person safely this fall."" OCR sent letters today to the chief state school officers of Iowa , Oklahoma , South Carolina , Tennessee , and Utah , outlining how prohibitions of universal indoor masking prevent school districts from implementing health and safety policies that they determine are necessary to protect students from exposure to COVID-19, including those with underlying medical conditions related to their disability. OCR is concerned that state mask restrictions on schools and school districts ""may be preventing schools…from meeting their legal obligations not to discriminate based on disability and from providing an equal educational opportunity to students with disabilities who are at heightened risk of severe illness from COVID-19,"" the letter states. OCR has not opened investigations in Florida, Texas, Arkansas, or Arizona because those states' bans on universal indoor masking are not currently being enforced as a result of court orders or other state actions. Due to these rulings and actions, districts should be able to implement universal indoor masking in schools to protect the health and safety of their students and staff. However, the Department will continue to closely monitor those states and is prepared to take action if state leaders prevent local schools or districts from implementing universal indoor masking or if the current court decisions were to be reversed. The investigations will explore each state's compliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504), which is a federal law that protects students with disabilities from discrimination based on their disability. Section 504 guarantees qualified students with disabilities the right to a free appropriate public education in elementary and secondary school, commonly referred to as FAPE. This includes the right of students with disabilities to receive their education in the regular educational environment, alongside their peers without disabilities, to the maximum extent appropriate to their needs. The investigations will also explore whether statewide prohibitions on universal indoor masking violate Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, which prohibits disability discrimination by public entities, including public education systems and institutions. OCR's regional offices will begin collecting data from each state educational agency as part of the direct investigations over the coming weeks. During the investigation, OCR is a neutral factfinder, collecting and analyzing relevant evidence from state education agencies and other sources as appropriate prior to reaching determinations in these matters. Opening a directed investigation does not imply that OCR has decided whether there has been a violation of a law that OCR enforces. On Aug. 18, 2021, President Biden issued a Presidential Memorandum directing the Secretary of Education to ""assess all available tools in taking action, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law"" to ensure that governors and other officials are giving all students the opportunity to participate and remain in full-time, in-person learning safely, without compromising their health or the health of their families. In response to the President's call, Secretary Cardona laid out the steps the Department of Education can take to protect the rights of all students to access safe in-person learning equally, including using the enforcement authority of the Office for Civil Rights. Secretary Cardona also sent letters earlier this month to each of the states that are the subject of the direct investigations that OCR announced today. The letters note that: ""The safe return to in-person instruction requires that school districts be able to protect the health and safety of students and educators, and that families have confidence that their schools are doing everything possible to keep students healthy."""

Minnesota’s plan details how the state is using and plans to use ARP ESSER funds to safely reopen and sustain the safe operation of schools and equitably expand opportunity for students who need it most, particularly those most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. As schools and states begin the new school year, the Department released the Return to School Roadmap , which provides key resources and supports for students, parents, educators, and school communities to build excitement around returning to classrooms this school year and outlines how federal funding can support the safe and sustained return to in-person learning. ARP funds can be used to support the roadmap’s efforts. Earlier this year, the Department distributed two thirds of the ARP ESSER funds, totaling $81 billion, to 50 states and the District of Columbia. The remaining third of the funding to states will be made available once state plans are approved. Minnesota is receiving $1.3 billion total in ARP ESSER funds, and today’s approval of their plan will result in the release of the final $441 million. Last week, the Department approved plans for Alaska, Connecticut, Illinois, and Louisiana. Today’s approval means a total of 33 ARP ESSER state plans have been approved since June. The Department has approved plans supporting more than 50 percent of students nationwide. “I am excited to announce approval for Minnesota’s plan,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “It is heartening to see, reflected in these state plans, the ways in which states are thinking deeply about how to use American Rescue Plan funds to continue to provide critical support to schools and communities, particularly as we look ahead to the upcoming academic year. The approval of these plans enables states to receive vital, additional American Rescue Plan funds to quickly and safely reopen schools for full-time, in-person learning; meet students’ academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs; and address disparities in access to educational opportunity that were exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. The state plans that have been submitted to the Department lay the groundwork for the ways in which an unprecedented infusion of federal resources will be used to address the urgent needs of America’s children and build back better.” “Minnesota’s plan to help students and families recover from the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic focuses on evidence-based practices in academics, mental health, and school-community partnerships that have impacts both in the classroom and beyond the school day,” said Minnesota Education Commissioner Dr. Heather Mueller. “The American Rescue Plan funds will support our state’s COVID recovery efforts to ensure we meet the unique needs of our students and school communities, and build our capacity for long-term improvements.” “As students head back to school in-person this fall, we must have the protocols and resources in place to support safe learning,” said Sen. Amy Klobuchar. “The distribution of this funding will help that effort by providing key services to address learning loss and protect the health and safety of students and educators as we continue fighting this pandemic.” “Our students and educators have faced significant challenges throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, and I’m pleased that Democrats in Congress and the Biden Administration responded with unprecedented resources within the American Rescue Plan,” said Rep. Betty McCollum. “The Department of Education’s approval of Minnesota’s plan will get these funds into our schools to ensure the safety of our students, educators, and school staff this fall. The American Rescue Plan continues to deliver for Minnesota schools, families, and communities.” “As we worked to design and pass the American Rescue Plan earlier this year, one of my top priorities was ensuring that we provided our local school districts with the resources necessary to safely reopen and get our children back in the classroom,” said Rep. Angie Craig. “I couldn’t be prouder about the disbursal of these funds, which will help our local leaders to prioritize the health of our teachers, the wellbeing of our students and the quality of our education for years to come.” The ARP ESSER state plans approved by the Department, including Minnesota, show how states are using federal pandemic resources to support safe in-person instruction and meet the social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs of students—with a focus on the students most impacted by the pandemic. For example: Safely Reopening Schools and Sustaining Safe Operations: Minnesota has developed and promoted the Roll Up Your Sleeves campaign to increase vaccination rates, which includes targeted outreach to 12–17-year-olds. Additionally, the Minnesota Department of Education (MDE) is promoting the Vaccine Connector, which allows Minnesotans to find vaccination clinics near them. MDE is connecting local public health departments and school districts and charter schools to provide onsite school vaccination clinics for students, staff, and community members. Addressing the Academic Impact of Lost Instructional Time: MDE will award ARP ESSER funds to districts and charters to address the academic impact of lost instructional time. Districts and charters will be required to select and implement evidence-based practices focused on the needs of historically underserved students, including those who have missed the most in-person instruction and who did not consistently participate in remote instruction. Priority areas for the use of funding include tutoring, expanding access to community schools that provide wraparound services, early learning, and increasing student support personnel such as school counselors and school nurses. Investing in Summer Learning and Expanded Afterschool Programs: MDE will award ARP ESSER funds for summer learning and enrichment programs to community organizations, with an emphasis on community-based organizations that have experience working with student populations that were disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including students from low-income families; Hispanic or Latino, American Indian, Asian, and Black students; English learners; students with disabilities; migratory students; students in foster care; and neglected, delinquent, and incarcerated students. MDE will also award funds for evidence-based comprehensive afterschool programs to community organizations through Ignite Afterschool, which is Minnesota's affiliate of the National Afterschool Association. Staffing to Support Students' Needs: Minnesota will use ARP ESSER funds to support districts and charters in hiring licensed school counselors, school nurses, school social workers, school psychologists, and alcohol and chemical dependency counselors to help provide early responses to support students' social-emotional and mental health. A total of 46 states, and the District of Columbia, have submitted their ARP ESSER state plans to the Department. The Department is reviewing the plans expeditiously and is in contact with states to ensure their plans meet all necessary requirements in order to access the remaining funds, as outlined in the ARP. The Department also is in contact with states that have not yet submitted plans, the vast majority of which are due to state board of education or legislative review requirements. The distribution of ARP ESSER funds is part of the Department's broader effort to support students and districts as they work to reengage students impacted by the pandemic, address inequities exacerbated by COVID-19, and build our education system back better than before. In addition to providing $130 billion for K-12 education in the American Rescue Plan to support the safe reopening of K-12 schools and meet the needs of all students, the Biden-Harris Administration also has: Launched the Return To School Roadmap to provide key resources and supports for students, parents, educators, and school communities to build excitement around returning to classrooms this school year and outline how federal funding can support the safe and sustained return to in-person learning Released three volumes of the COVID-19 Handbook Held a National Safe School Reopening Summit /li> Prioritized the vaccination of educators, school staff and child care workers.

These resources will help get us safely back to school this fall and address the learning loss and the social and emotional toll that the last year took on students, educators, and our communities."" The ARP ESSER state plans approved by the Department today, including Louisiana, show how states are using Federal pandemic resources to support safe in-person instruction and meet the social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs of students—with a focus on the students most impacted by the pandemic. For example: Supporting Students Most Impacted by the Pandemic: The Louisiana Department of Education (LDOE) requires Louisiana school systems to develop plans that focus on addressing interrupted instruction for underserved students, including students living in deep poverty, students with disabilities, English learners, migrant students, students experiencing homelessness, and children in foster care. LDOE has provided guidance to school systems on analyzing data to determine students' current needs. School systems have updated reopening plans in preparation for the 2021-2022 school year that are focused on in-person instruction. Addressing the Academic Impact of Lost Instructional Time: LDOE will allocate ARP ESSER funds reserved for addressing the impact of lost instructional time to school systems through a discretionary grant process that prioritizes students most impacted by the pandemic. The state's plan emphasizes accelerating learning—which connects unfinished instruction to new learning rather than remediation—and includes tutoring in reading and math. Expanding Summer Learning and Enrichment Opportunities : LDOE intends to award incentive funds to support school systems in implementing summer learning programs that include tutoring and community service opportunities. The summer learning programs will prioritize students most impacted by the pandemic. Expanding Afterschool Programs: LDOE intends to award incentive funds to support school systems in implementing comprehensive afterschool programs that include elective opportunities, tutoring, and mentorship. These programs will rebuild strong relationships with students and families through mentoring, assisting students' transition back to in-person learning, addressing gaps in learning through one-on-one or small group focused instruction, and engaging students in enrichment activities to foster meaningful experiences. Focusing on Early Literacy: LDOE will allocate ARP ESSER funds to provide literacy screeners to school systems. The state also will use ARP ESSER funds to support Louisiana's Science of Reading initiative to improve literacy and decrease the number of students ""at risk"" for reading difficulties. Strengthening the Educator Pipeline : LDOE will invest ARP ESSER funds to strengthen the educator pipeline through key initiatives: providing new teacher supports to increase retention; expanding pre-educator pathways to build a cadre of aspiring teachers; and increasing the number of content leaders who are local educators with the knowledge, skills, and concrete resources to provide high-quality, content-rich, and curriculum-specific professional development to new and current teachers in their districts. Emphasizing Student Engagement: LDOE is using ARP ESSER funds to create a new state-level leadership role in the Office of College and Career Readiness to lead state-level efforts to identify and re-engage students who have missed significant amounts of school during the 2019-20 and 2020-21 school years. This position also will serve as the subject matter authority on child welfare and attendance programs, and develop and manage cross-agency initiatives. LDOE is also partnering with Louisiana State University to re-engage students who have missed in-person instruction or have been disengaged in remote instruction. A total of 46 states, and the District of Columbia, have submitted their ARP ESSER state plans to the Department. The Department is reviewing the plans expeditiously and is in contact with states to ensure their plans meet all necessary requirements in order to access the remaining funds, as outlined in the ARP.

The ARP ESSER state plans approved by the Department today, including Alaska, show how states are using federal pandemic resources to support safe in-person instruction and meet the social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs of students—with a focus on the students most impacted by the pandemic. For example: Safely Reopening Schools and Sustaining Safe Operations: The Alaska Department of Education and Early Development (DEED) will provide districts guidance and support through a variety of methods, including providing current CDC guidance on masks, physical distancing, handwashing, and respiratory etiquette; cleaning; contact tracing; diagnostic and screening testing; vaccination efforts; and appropriate accommodations for children with disabilities. DEED will work closely with the Alaska Department of Health and Social Services to provide statewide guidance and additional resources and supports on mitigation plans required under the ARP Act. Addressing the Academic Impact of Lost Instructional Time: DEED will focus on evidence-based strategies for reading and career and technical education. DEED will support districts, community-based organizations, tribal organizations, and other non-profit entities in implementing evidence-based reading instruction for grades K-5, provide educators with professional development in the science of reading, and make high quality instructional resources and activities available to all students statewide. DEED also will create statewide career and technical education programs of study that span elementary to postsecondary education. Lastly, DEED will partner with local communities to design and implement projects involving academic tutoring, work-based learning, and general school-improvement efforts. Investing in Summer Learning and Expanded Afterschool Programs: DEED will establish a grant program for summer and afterschool out-of-school time that prioritizes students most impacted by the pandemic (students from low-income families, students from underrepresented racial/ethnic groups, English learners, students with disabilities, students experiencing homelessness, migratory students, and students in foster care) and focus on literacy, career readiness, or work-based learning. The program design must include academic and social-emotional skills, consistent and frequent participation by students, and small staff-to-student ratios. Both school districts and community-based organizations are able to receive grant funding. Supporting Students' Social, Emotional, and Mental Health Needs: DEED is using ARP ESSER funds to support in-house school social workers who will assist district staff with social work tasks in rural and remote districts. The social workers will provide professional development on trauma-engaged practices, virtual self‐care, training on reducing student stress and depression, support for escalating anxiety of staff and students, social-emotional learning, and school mental health related resources. A total of 46 states, and the District of Columbia, have submitted their ARP ESSER state plans to the Department. The Department is reviewing the plans expeditiously and is in contact with states to ensure their plans meet all necessary requirements in order to access the remaining funds, as outlined in the ARP.

That's why I worked alongside the Biden-Harris Administration to include this federal funding in the American Rescue Plan to get kids back to school safely,"" said U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin. ""I'm happy to see the Department of Education approve Illinois' plan, which will help schools implement protocols to maintain a safe and supportive environment for students and educators as we enter a new school year."" The ARP ESSER state plans approved by the Department today, including Illinois, show how states are using federal pandemic resources to support safe in-person instruction and meet the social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs of students—with a focus on the students most impacted by the pandemic. For example: Returning to In Person Learning in 2021: Beginning with the 2021-2022 school year, all schools must resume fully in-person learning for all student attendance days, provided that remote instruction be made available for students who have not received a COVID-19 vaccine and are in quarantine consistent with state or local public health guidance. Safely Reopening Schools and Sustaining Safe Operations: Illinois is undertaking efforts to vaccinate entire school communities, including teachers, staff, and eligible students. The Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE) has provided schools with information on how to talk about the vaccine, how to build vaccine confidence, and how to partner with their local community vaccine providers to host vaccine clinics for their staff, students, and families. Communications on vaccinations, accessibility, and efficacy have been released and will continue to be updated and provided to schools into the new school year. Addressing the Academic Impact of Lost Instructional Time and Investing in Summer Learning and Expanded Afterschool Program: ISBE will provide $345 million in formula-based funding to all school districts and other entities including special education cooperatives, to support evidence-based interventions that address the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on certain groups of students, including students who have missed the most in-person instruction and students who did not consistently participate in remote instruction. ISBE will also dedicate $12 million to implement a high-impact tutoring program. Closing the Digital Divide: ISBE will dedicate $52 million to closing the digital divide, building on its efforts through earlier federal pandemic recovery funds to ensure all school districts have the capacity to equip each student with their own computer. This will empower students to engage more fully in 21st century learning. Supporting Students' and Educators' Social, Emotional, and Mental Health Needs: ISBE will dedicate $50 million in ARP ESSER funds for competitive grants to schools and community-based organizations to create community partnerships to support the social emotional and mental health needs of students and staff. Priority will be given to those applicants proposing to serve districts in counties most greatly impacted by COVID-19 (students from low-income families, students from underrepresented racial/ethnic groups, English learners, students with disabilities, students experiencing homelessness, migratory students, and students in foster care). ISBE will also provide statewide training on the Trauma Responsive School Assessment so that trainers can work with districts to identify needs and develop action plans. Staffing to Support Students' Needs: One of ISBE's top priorities is to support LEAs in filling the nearly 1,000 position shortage of educators and the expansion and diversification of the educator pipeline. Nearly $10 million of ARP ESSER funds will be used for projects to help build a diverse workforce that reflects the states' student population, including partnerships with educator preparation programs and teacher residency programs. A total of 46 states, and the District of Columbia, have submitted their ARP ESSER state plans to the Department. The Department is reviewing the plans expeditiously and is in contact with states to ensure their plans meet all necessary requirements in order to access the remaining funds, as outlined in the ARP. The Department also is in contact with states that have not yet submitted plans, the vast majority of which are due to state board of education or legislative review requirements. The distribution of ARP ESSER funds is part of the Department's broader effort to support students and districts as they work to reengage students impacted by the pandemic, address inequities exacerbated by COVID-19, and build our education system back better than before. In addition to providing $130 billion for K-12 education in the American Rescue Plan to support the safe reopening of K-12 schools and meet the needs of all students, the Biden-Harris Administration also has: Launched the Return To School Roadmap to provide key resources and supports for students, parents, educators, and school communities to build excitement around returning to classrooms this school year and outline how federal funding can support the safe and sustained return to in-person learning Released three volumes of the COVID-19 Handbook Held a National Safe School Reopening Summit Prioritized the vaccination of educators, school staff and child care workers. As of the end of May an estimated 84% of teachers and school staff were fully vaccinated. Provided $10 billion in funding for COVID-19 testing for PreK-12 educators, staff, and students. Launched a series of Equity Summits focused on addressing inequities that existed before, but were made worse by the pandemic Released a report on the disparate impacts of COVID-19 on underserved communities Developed a Safer Schools and Campuses Best Practices Clearinghouse elevating hundreds of best practices to support schools' efforts to reopen safely and address the impacts of COVID-19 on students, educators, and communities In addition to the actions the Biden Administration has taken to reopen schools, the President has proposed critical investments through his Build Back Better agenda that will enable schools to rebuild stronger than they were before the pandemic, such as investing billions to build a diverse educator workforce, expand access to pre-K to all families, and invest in school infrastructure, among other provisions."

Connecticut's plan details how the state is using and plans to use ARP ESSER funds to safely reopen and sustain the safe operation of schools and equitably expand opportunity for students who need it most, particularly those most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. As schools and states begin the new school year, the Department released the Return To School Roadmap, which provides key resources and supports for students, parents, educators, and school communities to build excitement around returning to classrooms this school year and outlines how federal funding can support the safe and sustained return to in-person learning. ARP funds can be used to support the roadmap's efforts. Earlier this year, the Department distributed two thirds of the ARP ESSER funds, totaling $81 billion, to 50 states and the District of Columbia. The remaining third of the funding to states will be made available once state plans are approved. Connecticut is receiving $1.1 billion total in ARP ESSER funds, and today's approval of their plan will result in the release of the final $369 million. Additionally, the Department approved plans for Alaska, Illinois, and Louisiana. Today's approvals mean a total of 32 ARP ESSER state plans have been approved since June. The Department has approved plans supporting more than 50 percent of students nationwide. ""Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have been striving to make the investments necessary to help our school communities meet their areas of greatest need, especially for those students disproportionately affected by the pandemic,"" Commissioner of Education Charlene Russell-Tucker said. ""This historic level of funding allows us, as one educational community, to be bold and innovative as we forge our path to a transformative and equitable recovery."" ""These funds were specifically directed by Congress to help schools reopen safely and enable in-person learning to thrive,"" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal. ""Putting students back in Connecticut classrooms is critical to overcoming the setbacks and learning gaps resulting from the pandemic. Our approving this American Rescue Plan funds is a game changing step, and I look forward to continuing to work with the Biden Administration to ensure our schools remain open and safe for students, teachers, and staff."" ""As Connecticut kids head back to school, it is critical that educators have the federal funding necessary to help them thrive,"" said Sen. Chris Murphy. ""I am grateful Connecticut continues to be a leader in addressing the needs of all our students by putting together a plan that meets this moment. The Department of Education's approval of this plan means Connecticut's educators will soon have an additional $369 million to support our children's academic, social, mental, and emotional needs as we continue to navigate COVID-19."" ""Students have faced the devastating impacts of the pandemic, and funding from the American Rescue Plan has already supported local school districts in addressing their needs,"" said Rep. Jahana Hayes. ""This latest ESSER funding from the Department of Education fulfills a promise to Connecticut students and families. As resources are made available, the funding from the American Rescue Plan will get them safely to schools and address learning loss, and the social, economic, and emotional toll the last year has had on students, educators, and our communities at large."" The ARP ESSER state plans approved by the Department today, including Connecticut, show how states are using federal pandemic resources to support safe in-person instruction and meet the social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs of students—with a focus on the students most impacted by the pandemic. For example: Returning to In-Person Learning: The Connecticut State Department of Education (CSDE) expects school districts to offer in-person instruction for the 2021-2022 school year. Addressing the Academic Impact of Lost Instructional Time: CSDE will use ARP ESSER resources to support a model K-8 curricula. This will include high-quality instructional materials that will be made available on the state's Open Education Resources portal; two digital platforms to support learning acceleration and credit recovery; high-dosage tutoring to support students with specific learning disabilities; and expanded pathways to educator certification focusing on multilingual educators, special education educators, educators of color, and male educators. Additionally, CSDE will partner with the juvenile justice system and contracted residential treatment programs to provide high-quality instructional resources, devices, and access to digital curricula to align with the public school setting. Investing in Summer Learning and Expanded Afterschool Programs: CSDE launched a competitive Expansion Grant program to provide up to $25,000 to summer enrichment programs to expand capacity for summer 2021 and an Innovation Grant program to provide up to $250,000 to summer enrichment programs that scale-up summer enrichment opportunities. For summer 2021, more than $8.6 million was allocated to grant recipients. The state is taking a similar approach to fund comprehensive afterschool programs. Supporting Students' and Educators Social, Emotional, and Mental Health Needs: CSDE will use ARP ESSER funds to help address the mental health challenges of transitioning back to the classroom. CSDE will fund schools to partner with community-based mental health agencies to provide on-site mental health specialists to support students. Other potential investments include support for existing mental health providers, working with or creating more school-based health centers, and hiring or deploying more behavioral health staff. Supporting Family Engagement: CSDE will use ARP ESSER funding to support school district efforts to strengthen educators' engagement with families. CSDE is continually engaging with stakeholders, including community-based and parent organizations, to determine the best use of ARP ESSER funds to further family and community engagement and to support districts in their efforts. As CSDE implements the initiatives outlined in the state plan, additional future family and community engagement efforts to gather input may include, but are not limited to, public forums, ThoughtExchanges, community visits, focus groups, and surveys. CSDE will update its plan as appropriate when additional specific strategies are determined. A total of 46 states, and the District of Columbia, have submitted their ARP ESSER state plans to the Department. The Department is reviewing the plans expeditiously and is in contact with states to ensure their plans meet all necessary requirements in order to access the remaining funds, as outlined in the ARP. The Department also is in contact with states that have not yet submitted plans, the vast majority of which are due to state board of education or legislative review requirements. The distribution of ARP ESSER funds is part of the Department's broader effort to support students and districts as they work to reengage students impacted by the pandemic, address inequities exacerbated by COVID-19, and build our education system back better than before.

26-Aug-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/extended-closed-school-discharge-will-provide-115k-borrowers-itt-technical-institute-more-11b-loan-forgiveness,Extended Closed School Discharge Will Provide 115K Borrowers from ITT Technical Institute More Than $1.1B in Loan Forgiveness,"Today, the U.S. Department of Education announced it will make $1.1 billion in closed school discharges available to an additional 115,000 borrowers who attended the now-defunct ITT Technical Institute (ITT). This decision is based on a new review of the problems leading up to ITT's closure. These borrowers did not complete their degree or credential and left ITT on or after March 31, 2008. The Department estimates that 43 percent of these borrowers are currently in default. Today's action brings the total amount of loan discharges approved by the Department since January 2021 to $9.5 billion, affecting over 563,000 borrowers. This action extends relief to borrowers whose attendance at ITT overlapped with a period during which the institution engaged in widespread misrepresentations about the true state of its financial health and misled students into taking out unaffordable private loans that were allegedly portrayed as grant aid. ITT's malfeasance drove its financial resources away from educating students in order to keep the school in business for years longer than it likely would otherwise have, resulting in debts that are being discharged starting today. Approximately 7,000 of the borrowers covered by today's closed school discharge announcement also have approved borrower defense to repayment claims. ""For years, ITT hid its true financial state from borrowers while luring many of them into taking out private loans with misleading and unaffordable terms that may have caused borrowers to leave school,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""Today's action continues the Department's efforts to improve and use its targeted loan relief authorities to deliver meaningful help to student borrowers. At the same time, the continued cost of addressing the wrongdoing of ITT and other predatory institutions yet again highlights the need for stronger and faster accountability throughout the federal financial aid system."" Under the Higher Education Act and applicable regulations, the Secretary of Education discharges the loans of borrowers and refunds any amounts paid if the borrowers did not complete their program of study because of their school's closure. This applies to borrowers with loans from the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program, the Federal Family Education Loan Program, and the Federal Perkins Loan Program. To be eligible for a closed school discharge, the borrower must not have completed their program or transferred their credits or hours to another school. Discharges are also available to any borrower who withdrew from the institution within a few months of its closing. The Secretary of Education may, however, extend this period based on exceptional circumstances. After a thorough review of the circumstances leading to ITT's closure and the preceding years of misrepresentations and misconduct, Secretary Cardona is exercising his authority to extend the closed school discharge window to March 31, 2008 for former ITT students. This date was chosen based upon a review of external evidence from the bankruptcy court proceedings for ITT, filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). March 31, 2008 is when the company's executives publicly disclosed the start of a financial scheme that kicked off a series of misrepresentations to hide the true nature of the school's finances following a public loss of outside financing, which led to shifting additional costs to students and hindered its ability to invest in delivering quality education to students. Next steps for borrowers Under Department regulations, borrowers who are eligible for a closed school discharge and attended an institution that shut down between November 1, 2013 and July 1, 2020 will receive an automatic discharge as long as they did not enroll in another institution within three years of their school's closure. Eligible borrowers who attended ITT within 120 days of its closure in 2016 received automatic discharges in 2019. The majority of the ITT borrowers covered by today's action did not enroll elsewhere during the three years after ITT's closure and will not need to take any further action to receive a discharge. Borrowers who enrolled elsewhere but did not complete their program of study may still be eligible for a discharge, but will need to submit an application. Borrowers can access the closed school discharge application by contacting their servicer or visiting StudentAid gov/closedschoolform and returning a completed application to their servicer. The Department will begin processing discharges in September 2021 and borrowers will start receiving automatic discharges in the following weeks. Continued commitments to helping student loan borrowers Today's action is another in a series of steps the Department has to support students and borrowers, make higher education more affordable, and improve student loan servicing, including: Extending the pause on student loan repayment, interest, and collections through January 31, 2022 and expanding it to include additional borrowers in default. This change helps 41 million borrowers. Approving $1.5 billion in borrower defense claims, including extending full relief to approved claims and approving new types of claims. Providing $7.1 billion in relief for borrowers eligible for total and permanent disability discharges. This includes $5.8 billion in automatic student loan discharges to 323,000 borrowers and reinstating $1.3 billion in loan discharges for another 41,000 borrowers. Helping 30,000 small business owners with student loans seeking help from the Paycheck Protection Program. Retroactively waiving student loan interest for 47,000 current and former active-duty military service members."
24-Aug-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/new-guidance-reaffirms-importance-full-implementation-individuals-disabilities-education-act-amidst-covid-19-pandemic,New Guidance Reaffirms Importance of Full Implementation of Individuals with Disabilities Education Act Amidst COVID-19 Pandemic,"Today, the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS) sent a letter to its state and local partners reiterating its commitment to ensuring children with disabilities and their families have successful early intervention and educational experiences in the 2021-2022 school year. This letter outlines a series of question and answers (Q&As) as children and students return to in-person learning. The Q&As focus on topics to help ensure that—regardless of the COVID-19 pandemic or the mode of instruction, children with disabilities receive a free appropriate public education (FAPE) in accordance with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), and that infants and toddlers with disabilities and their families receive early intervention services. ""Serving all children and students with disabilities in our public schools isn't just written into law – it's a moral obligation and strong equitable practice. When we recognize and celebrate these differences as strengths, and when we help all children make progress toward challenging educational goals, everyone benefits,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""I'm proud that the Department is releasing these tools as part of the federal government's important and necessary obligation to IDEA."" The Q&As document on Child Find Under Part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act released with the letter is the first Q&A in the series and reaffirms the importance of appropriate implementation of IDEA's child find obligations, which requires the identification, location and evaluation, of all children with disabilities in the states. An effective child find system is an ongoing part of each state's responsibility to ensure that FAPE is made available to all eligible children with disabilities. Other topic areas under IDEA include: meeting timelines; ensuring implementation of initial evaluation and reevaluation procedures; determining eligibility for special education and related services; providing the full array of special education and related services, that may include compensatory services, for students with disabilities to ensure they receive a FAPE; and delayed evaluations and early intervention services to infants and toddlers with disabilities and their families served under IDEA Part C. ""The pandemic didn't alter IDEA's guarantee of FAPE. This school year will be important for children, students, and educators,"" said Katherine Neas, acting assistant secretary of OSERS. ""These guidance documents are one more example of federal technical assistance available to help states ensure student success."" Today's announcement underscores the need for the Department to continue to provide support to states to ensure they have the information necessary to carry out these important requirements and to make good use of the additional American Rescue Plan (ARP) funds to ensure the full implementation of IDEA requirements. In addition to the resources in today's announcement, the Department released the Return To School Roadmap , which provides key resources and supports for students, parents, educators, and school communities to build excitement and confidence in returning to classrooms this school year. The Roadmap also outlines how federal funding can support the safe and sustained return to in-person learning and how ARP funds can be used to support these reopening efforts."
20-Aug-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/secretary-cardona-tells-alachua-and-broward-county-school-districts-we-stand-you,"Secretary Cardona Tells Alachua and Broward County School Districts: ""We stand with you""","""The Biden Administration is fully committed to a safe and healthy return to in-person learning for all students this fall. It is deeply troubling to see state leaders putting politics ahead of the health and safety of our students, and that instead of supporting our educators for doing the right thing, state leaders are trying to punish them. This week, the President asked me to do everything I can to help protect our nation's students and support the local leaders who are fighting for them. Let me reiterate: we stand ready to assist any district facing repercussions for imposing CDC-recommended COVID-19 prevention strategies that will protect the health and safety of students, educators, and staff. To that end, we've also made clear to district leaders that any financial penalties imposed by the state can be addressed immediately using CARES, CRRSA, or American Rescue Plan funds. Today, I also spoke directly to the Superintendents of Broward and Alachua County schools to reassure them that the President and his Administration stand with them and with all educators who put student and staff health and education first."" Background As outlined in the Secretary's letter to Florida state leaders, the Department of Education considers these funds are part of ""activities that are necessary to maintain the operation of and continuity of services in local educational agencies and continuing to employ existing staff of the local educational agency"" and an allowable use of CARES, CRRSA, and American Rescue Plan funds. The Secretary spoke with Superintendent Dr. Vickie Cartwright from Broward County, and Superintendent Dr. Carlee Simon from Alachua County today and reiterated the Administration's support for dedicated educators like them doing the right thing to protect student, educator, and staff safety. He discussed how they can and should use federal pandemic relief funds to address any financial penalties levied against their districts as a result of them using CDC-recommended COVID-19 prevention strategies to protect the health and safety of their school communities. He also expressed disappointment in state leaders choosing to penalize educators at the time when they need the most support."
20-Aug-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-grants-interest-rate-benefit-more-47000-service-members,"U.S. Department of Education Grants Interest Rate Benefit to More Than 47,000 Service Members","Today, the U.S. Department of Education announced that the office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) has retroactively waived interest on loans held by more than 47,000 current and former active-duty service members. This action was made possible by a data-matching agreement with the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) that substantially improves access to a student loan interest-waiver benefit for many service members with federal student loans. Under the Higher Education Act, service members deployed to areas that qualify them for imminent danger or hostile fire pay, have no interest accrual on certain federal student loans that were first disbursed on or after Oct. 1, 2008. In the past, only a small proportion of eligible service members successfully accessed this benefit. For instance, the Department waived interest for only approximately 4,800 service members in 2019 when it did not have the data-match in place. Now the Department is able to identify federal student loan borrowers who serve on active duty by matching records to DOD's personnel records. As a result, the Department can automatically provide the student loan interest benefit to eligible service members. ""Brave men and women in uniform serving our country can now focus on doing their jobs and coming home safely, not filling out more paperwork to access their hard-earned benefits,"" said FSA Chief Operating Officer Richard Cordray. ""Federal Student Aid is grateful for our strong partnership with the Department of Defense, and we will seek to reduce red tape for service members wherever possible."" ""The Department of Defense appreciates the efforts and commitment of the Department of Education in ensuring eligible service members received this benefit,"" said Virginia Penrod, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Manpower & Reserve Affairs at the Department of Defense. Today's announcement means that service members are not required to take any action to receive the interest rate benefit. Prior to this new automation, service members had to make individual requests for the benefit and provide additional information confirming their eligibility. Recently, the Department announced its intent to form a negotiated rulemaking committee to address issues affecting federal student loan borrowers. The announcement invited nominations from constituent groups, including U.S. military service members, veterans, and the groups that represent their interests. Nominations are open through August 31, 2021. This action aligns with President Biden's belief that we have a sacred obligation to care for our nations' veterans and their families, both while they are deployed and after they return home."
19-Aug-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/over-323000-federal-student-loan-borrowers-receive-58-billion-automatic-total-and-permanent-disability-discharges,"Over 323,000 Federal Student Loan Borrowers to Receive $5.8 Billion in Automatic Total and Permanent Disability Discharges","Over 323,000 borrowers who have a total and permanent disability (TPD) will receive more than $5.8 billion in automatic student loan discharges due to a new regulation announced today by the U.S. Department of Education. The change will apply to borrowers who are identified through an existing data match with the Social Security Administration (SSA). It will begin with the September quarterly match with SSA. The Department is also announcing two other policy items related to TPD today. First, the Department will indefinitely extend the policy announced in March to stop asking these borrowers to provide information on their earnings —a process that results in the reinstatement of loans if and when borrowers do not respond—beyond the end of the national emergency. Second, the Department will then pursue the elimination of the three-year monitoring period required under current regulations during the negotiated rulemaking that will begin in October. ""Today's action removes a major barrier that prevented far too many borrowers with disabilities from receiving the total and permanent disability discharges they are entitled to under the law,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""From day one, I've stressed that the Department of Education is a service agency. We serve students, educators, and families across the country to ensure that educational opportunity is available to all. We've heard loud and clear from borrowers with disabilities and advocates about the need for this change and we are excited to follow through on it. This change reduces red tape with the aim of making processes as simple as possible for borrowers who need support."" This new regulation allows the Department to provide automatic TPD discharges for borrowers who are identified through administrative data matching by removing the requirement for these borrowers to fill out an application before receiving relief. The Department removed this application barrier in 2019 for borrowers identified as eligible for a TPD discharge through the match with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). However, it had not yet done so for those identified through the data match with SSA. As a result, only about half of borrowers identified as eligible for TPD through the SSA match have received the discharge, causing thousands to stay in repayment or possibly even default. This change will go into effect with the Department's next quarterly data match with SSA, which will occur in September. Borrowers will receive notices of their approval for a discharge in the weeks after the match and the Department expects that all discharges will occur by the end of the year. Borrowers who wish to opt out of their discharge for any reason will have an opportunity to do so. All discharges will be free from federal income taxation but there may be some state income tax consequences. Borrowers will be and are encouraged to consult their state's tax office to understand whether this discharge will be considered income under their state's tax code. The Department is also announcing a permanent change through negotiated rulemaking to requirements that in the past have caused too many borrowers to lose their discharges. Under the regulations, a borrower who receives a TPD discharge through the SSA match or the physician's certification process is subject to a three-year income monitoring period. During this period the borrower may lose their discharge if their earnings are above a certain threshold or they do not respond to a request for earnings information. A 2016 report by the Government Accountability Office found that 98 percent of reinstated disability discharges occurred because borrowers did not submit the requested documentation, not because their earnings were too high. The Department will take short- and long-term steps to address these reinstatement concerns. First, the Department will indefinitely stop sending automatic requests for earnings information even after the national emergency ends. This continues a practice that the Department announced in March 2021 for the duration of the national emergency. Next, the Department will propose eliminating the monitoring period entirely in the upcoming negotiated rulemaking that will begin in October. Today's regulation was issued in response to comments on an interim final rule published by the Department in 2019 that created a similarly automatic process for borrowers identified as eligible for a TPD discharge through a match with the VA. The Department received many comments requesting that the rule be expanded to include similar benefits for those identified through the SSA data match. With this TPD action, the Biden-Harris Administration has now approved approximately $8.7 billion in student loan discharges for roughly 455,000 borrowers. In late March , the Department restored $1.3 billion in loan discharges for 41,000 borrowers who had seen their loans reinstated after not responding to requests for earnings information. Since March 2021, the Department has also approved more than $1.5 billion in discharges through the borrower defense to repayment process for nearly 92,000 borrowers whose institutions took advantage of them. In addition, the Department has extended the pause on student loan repayment, interest, and collections, to January 31, 2022, which helps 41 million borrowers save billions of dollars a month."

CNMI PSS's plan details how $160 million in American Rescue Plan Outlying Areas State Educational Agencies funds will be used to safely reopen and sustain the safe operation of schools and equitably expand opportunity for students who need it most, particularly those most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Aligned with CNMI PSS's August return to school, the Department released the Return To School Roadmap , which provides key resources and supports for students, parents, educators, and school communities to build excitement around returning to classrooms this school year and outlines how federal funding can support the safe and sustained return to in-person learning. American Rescue Plan funds can be used to support the Roadmap's efforts. ""I am excited to announce approval of the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands' plan,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""It is heartening to see, reflected in these plans, the ways in which we are thinking deeply about how to use American Rescue Plan funds to continue to provide critical support to schools and communities, particularly as we look ahead to the upcoming academic year. The approval of these plans enables education systems to receive vital, additional American Rescue Plan funds to quickly and safely reopen schools for full-time, in-person learning; meet students' academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs; and address disparities in access to educational opportunity that were exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. The plans that have been submitted to the Department lay the groundwork for the ways in which an unprecedented infusion of federal resources will be used to address the urgent needs of America's children and build back better."" ""The Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands Public School System thanks the U.S. Department of Education for their approval of the ARP implementation plan as submitted by the team of educators that developed the plan,"" said CNMI Public School System Commissioner of Education Dr. Alfred Ada. ""The plan focuses on helping our schools address the lost instruction time through high dosage tutorials, socio-emotional counseling programs for students and staff, athletics and other programs that directly benefit student learning. On behalf of the team that developed our ARP plan, we thank the Secretary of Education, the Insular Area team, and all other staff who reviewed and approved our ARP implementation plan."" ""With this unprecedented pandemic and learning loss for students, the Biden-Harris Administration and Congress responded with unprecedented resources through the American Rescue Plan,"" said Rep. Gregorio Kilili Camacho Sablan. ""As the new school year begins, the U.S. Department of Education's approval today of over $160 million in American Rescue Plan funds for the Northern Mariana Islands will ensure a safe reopening of our schools, protect teacher jobs, and address the learning loss and the social and emotional toll the last year took on our students and educators."" The implementation plan approved by the Department today, outlines how federal pandemic funds are supporting safe in-person instruction and the social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs of students—with a focus on the students most impacted by the pandemic. For example: Returning to In-Person Learning in 2021: Vaccination for Education campaign – CNMI PSS is encouraging students 12 years old and above to get the COVID-19 vaccine with raffles to win prizes. Addressing the Academic Impact of Lost Instructional Time: The Student Portal Program, that currently offers high school online courses to students across the CNMI, will be expanded to offer a wide array of online course offerings to include elective and advanced placement courses available to both public and private schools throughout the CNMI. Additionally, the program will expand to offer more online learning opportunities at the middle school and elementary level. This is an important step in ensuring equity and access for all learners in the CNMI PSS. Investing in Summer Learning and Expanded Afterschool Programs: CMNI PSS will provide Extended Year Learning Opportunities for elementary and secondary students by offering face-to-face credit recovery, project-based learning, and other extended learning opportunities including Career Technical Education Program/Career Pathways and Chamorro and Carolinian Language and Heritage Studies. The American Rescue Plan Outlying Areas State Educational Agencies Fund, authorized under section 2005 of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, provides $850 million for the Secretary of Education to allocate to the Outlying Areas (American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) on the basis of their respective needs. The Secretary allocated these funds to support safely reopening and sustaining safe operations of schools while meeting the academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs of students resulting from the pandemic. Today's approval of the CNMI PSS implementation plan is part of the Department's broader effort to support teachers and other educators as they work to reengage students impacted by the pandemic, address inequities exacerbated by COVID-19, and build our education system back better than before. In addition to providing $130 billion for K-12 education in the American Rescue Plan to support the safe reopening of K-12 schools and meet the needs of all students, the Biden-Harris Administration also has: Released three volumes of the COVID-19 Handbook. Held a National Safe School Reopening Summit . Prioritized the vaccination of educators, school staff and child care workers. As of the end of May an estimated 84% of teachers and school staff were fully vaccinated. Provided $10 billion in funding for COVID-19 testing for PreK-12 educators, staff, and students. Launched a series of Equity Summits focused on addressing inequities that existed before, but were made worse by the pandemic. Released a report on the disparate impacts of COVID-19 on underserved communities. Developed a Safer Schools and Campuses Best Practices Clearinghouse elevating hundreds of best practices to support schools' efforts to reopen safely and address the impacts of COVID-19 on students, educators, and communities In addition to the actions the Biden Administration has taken to reopen schools, the President has proposed critical investments through his Build Back Better agenda that will enable schools to rebuild stronger than they were before the pandemic, such as investing billions to build a diverse educator workforce, expand access to pre-K to all families, and invest in school infrastructure, among other provisions."
16-Aug-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/education-labor-departments-renew-efforts-help-unemployed-americans-pursue-postsecondary-education,"Education, Labor Departments Renew Efforts to Help Unemployed Americans Pursue Postsecondary Education","Today, the U.S. Department of Education, in partnership with the U.S. Department of Labor, launched an initiative to help connect millions of unemployed Americans to postsecondary education, especially those displaced from their employment during the pandemic. To help all Americans seek educational opportunities or training that lead to good jobs, the Departments of Education and Labor will alert institutions of higher education and state workforce agencies about ways to help unemployment insurance (UI) beneficiaries access postsecondary education opportunities. The Biden Administration began this outreach with a series of actions: The Department of Education updated prior guidance to financial aid administrators at institutions of higher education about their authority to exercise “professional judgment” for individual financial aid applicants and adjust recently unemployed applicants’ income to zero. This action has helped ensure that students receive the maximum benefit to which they are entitled toward their postsecondary education. The Department of Labor will alert state workforce agencies that UI recipients, in many cases, are eligible for postsecondary education funding like federal student aid at institutions of higher education. “I am heartened that through these changes, the U.S. Departments of Education and Labor are helping unemployed Americans have the chance to go back to school, gain new knowledge and skills, and access opportunity through higher education,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “These efforts will go a long way toward expanding the middle class, growing the economy, and helping individuals lead thriving lives and support their families, as our nation continues to recover from the effects of the pandemic. I’m looking forward to furthering this invaluable cross-agency partnership and to seeing the ways that more Americans can benefit from it.” Additionally, the U.S. Department of Education created a new landing page that states can share with UI beneficiaries to help them identify offerings at colleges that are also eligible training providers under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA). Through WIOA, the federal government invests in the public workforce system. In some states, UI recipients can continue to receive benefits while attending school or training. The website is available at collegescorecard.ed.gov/training . This action renews a similar effort undertaken in 2009 by the Obama Administration, when more than 20 million individuals received information about their potential federal student aid eligibility. Subsequent research into the effectiveness of that initiative indicated that eligible individuals who received information about their potential Federal Pell Grant eligibility were 40 % more likely to enroll in a postsecondary program. Today’s announcement builds on the Biden Administration’s commitment to address the current economic crisis resulting from the pandemic and provide support to the colleges and communities that need it most. Last month, the Department announced temporary changes to the federal student aid verification process to remove obstacles from borrowers and focus on fraud. The Department has also provided access to billions in emergency aid to students and relief to institutions through the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund and has released guidance urging institutions to take steps to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and support their students."
13-Aug-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-educations-office-civil-rights-announces-civil-rights-data-collection-2021-22-school-year,U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights Announces Civil Rights Data Collection for the 2021-22 School Year,"Today, the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights announced in a letter to school superintendents that it will administer a 2021-22 Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC), marking the first time that OCR has conducted a CRDC, including all public school districts and their schools, two years in a row, for 2020-21 and 2021-22. The additional collection will help advance equity at a time when the nation’s educational landscape has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and schools are receiving substantial new federal funding to address new and longstanding challenges. Data from the CRDC will inform ongoing decisions regarding additional support that schools, educators, and students need to succeed, and will also assist OCR in meeting its mission to ensure schools and districts are complying with civil rights laws. “Without timely and robust data about students’ educational experiences, we cannot begin to understand and then address the impact that the pandemic has had – and continues to have – on student learning and success,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “We know that by working together, and by making this data available to educators and the public, we will improve educational opportunities and outcomes for our children and youth.” The CRDC gathers and publishes key information about student access to educational courses as well as school climate factors, such as use of discipline and student experiences of harassment and assault, from nearly every public school serving students from pre-K through 12th grade in all 50 states, D.C., and Puerto Rico. “Understanding the impact of the pandemic on students is a critical step to helping them get back on track. This is particularly important in light of reports showing that the pandemic worsened achievement gaps across the country. I applaud the Education Department for taking proactive steps to better understand how the pandemic has affected students and for their effort to examine the disproportionate impact on students of color. Earlier this year, Congress and the Biden Administration made a historic investment in students and schools through the American Rescue Plan. This data will be a vital tool to help schools target resources where they are needed most,” said House Committee on Education and Labor Chairman, U.S. Rep. Robert C. “Bobby” Scott (VA-03). “I’m glad to see Secretary Cardona’s commitment to collecting robust, quality data on students’ educational experiences,” said U.S. Sen. Patty Murray. “As we build back better from this pandemic, we must work to ensure that all of our students receive an equitable and high-quality education, free from discrimination and harassment – but unfortunately, for too many students, that's not the case. So it's critical that we collect data to identify longstanding inequities in our education system in order to address them. I’m glad to have the Department of Education committed to building an education system where every student can thrive, no matter their race, gender identity, sexual orientation, or disability status.” Today’s announcement ensures that the Department and the public will have the data necessary to better understand the experiences of students as the country continues to grapple with the impacts of COVID-19, especially after the pandemic-related postponement of the 2019-20 CRDC. Recognizing the critical work of school administrators, teachers, specialists, and support staff in ensuring that all students have equal access to education, the Department will continue to provide robust resources to support state educational agencies, districts, and schools in preparing for and completing the ongoing 2020-21 collection, as well as the collection for the 2021–22 school year."

Indiana’s plan details how the state is using and plans to use ARP ESSER funds to safely reopen and sustain the safe operation of schools and equitably expand opportunity for students who need it most, particularly those most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. As schools and states gear up for the return to school, the Department released the Return To School Roadmap , which provides key resources and supports for students, parents, educators, and school communities to build excitement around returning to classrooms this school year and outlines how federal funding can support the safe and sustained return to in-person learning. ARP funds can be used to support the roadmap’s efforts. Earlier this year, the Department distributed two thirds of the ARP ESSER funds, totaling $81 billion, to 50 states and the District of Columbia. The remaining third of the funding to states will be made available once state plans are approved. Indiana is receiving more than $1.9 billion total in ARP ESSER funds, and today’s approval of their plan will result in the release of the final $666 million. Additionally, the Department approved plans for Alabama, Kentucky, New Jersey, North Dakota, and South Carolina. Today’s approvals mean a total of 28 ARP ESSER state plans have been approved since June. The Department has approved plans supporting more than 50 percent of students nationwide. “I am excited to announce approval of Indiana’s plan,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “It is heartening to see, reflected in these state plans, the ways in which states are thinking deeply about how to use American Rescue Plan funds to continue to provide critical support to schools and communities, particularly as we move into the summer and look ahead to the upcoming academic year. The approval of these plans enables states to receive vital, additional American Rescue Plan funds to quickly and safely reopen schools for full-time, in-person learning; meet students’ academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs; and address disparities in access to educational opportunity that were exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. The state plans that have been submitted to the Department lay the groundwork for the ways in which an unprecedented infusion of federal resources will be used to address the urgent needs of America’s children and build back better.” “I am extremely pleased that Hoosier schools have received this major funding boost from the American Rescue Plan, which I worked hard to get passed by Congress,” said Rep. André Carson. “In order to build back better, we must improve our education systems, so students, teachers and staff can move beyond the unprecedented disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. These resources will help Hoosier students get back to school safely and remain on the path to success. There’s still more to do, and I will continue working with the Biden-Harris Administration to strengthen our schools and communities.” The ARP ESSER state plans approved by the Department today, including Indiana, show how states are using federal pandemic resources to support safe in-person instruction and meet the social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs of students—with a focus on the students most impacted by the pandemic. For example: Safely Reopening Schools and Sustaining Safe Operations: The Indiana Department of Education (IDOE) will continue to work alongside the Indiana Department of Health (IDOH) to provide guidance on safely maintaining the health of students, educators, and other staff. Addressing the Academic Impact of Lost Instructional Time & Investing in Summer Learning and Expanded Afterschool Programs: IDOE will be soliciting public comment through Sept. 5 to inform its selection of evidence-based interventions to address the impact of lost instructional time, summer learning, and afterschool programs. Interventions may incentivize and support local communities to reimagine educational opportunities and multidisciplinary course frameworks. A total of 46 states, and the District of Columbia, have submitted their ARP ESSER state plans to the Department. The Department is reviewing the plans expeditiously and is in contact with states to ensure their plans meet all necessary requirements in order to access the remaining funds, as outlined in the ARP. The Department is also in contact with states that have not yet submitted plans, the vast majority of which are due to state board of education or legislative review requirements.

Addressing the Academic Impact of Lost Instructional Time: ALSDE will use ARP ESSER funds in 2021 to support LEAs to address students most impacted by the pandemic via summer reading camps for grades K-3. The summer reading camps will provide direct, explicit, and systematic reading intervention services and supports to improve any identified area of reading deficiency. At a minimum, 70 hours of scientifically based reading instruction and intervention must take place. Supporting Students’ and Educators Social, Emotional, and Mental Health Needs: To support improved mental health and social emotional needs, ALSDE will further prioritize comprehensive wraparound services within a multi-tiered support system. ALSDE will continue to provide detailed guidance to districts for utilizing federal funds to increase student access to key support staff and expand grant funding to districts. These funds will support the hiring and supplies of key support staff including nurses, school counselors, school social workers, school psychologists, and other support professionals.

Murphy and the State Department of Education,” said Acting Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Education Angelica Allen-McMillan. “We are grateful to education stakeholders, including members of the State Board of Education, whose consultation helped ensure that our state’s use of ARP ESSER funds meets the needs of all students and educators; to President Biden, Secretary Cardona, and to the U.S. Congress for authorizing and implementing this important legislation; and most importantly to New Jersey’s education community, which has demonstrated exceptional resilience and grace in the face of unprecedented challenges. The New Jersey Department of Education looks forward to continuing to support our local educational agencies’ use of federal funds to provide safe, inclusive, and supportive learning environments for all New Jersey students.” “The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted in-person learning in unprecedented ways and exacerbated learning loss for students across the country, particularly in low-income neighborhoods and communities of color,” said Sen. Bob Menendez. “With this in mind, the Biden-Harris Administration and Democrats in Congress responded to this growing challenge by making critical and urgent investments in our children’s education as part of the American Rescue Plan. That is why I am thrilled to see the Department of Education approve New Jersey’s plan, which will ensure our children and educators can safely return to in-person learning this fall and address learning loss and the social and emotional toll the last year and a half has taken on students, educators, and our communities.” “Over the past year, we’ve seen the immense burden placed upon our nation’s students and teachers as they adjusted to a new reality brought on by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Sen.

Donald Norcross. This funding will provide critical resources that benefit students’ physical and mental health. I applaud the Biden-Harris Administration for its focus on reopening our schools safely and with the resources needed to help our children, educators and community build back better.” “I’m happy to see the Department of Education approve New Jersey’s American Rescue Plan Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ARP ESSER) plan,” said Rep. Mikie Sherrill. “The pandemic has placed unprecedented strain on students and teachers, and the approval of this plan will enable New Jersey to receive critical additional ARP funds. These resources are an important step to ensuring New Jersey’s schools can safely reopen and operate as well as address the social, educational, and emotional needs of our students, educators, and communities.” “I am so glad to see the Department of Education approve New Jersey’s plan to support our K-12 schools and students after an unprecedented year,” said Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman. “These resources are critical to helping our students and educators safely transition back to the classroom this fall. It is so important to recognize all the hard work our communities have done and address the learning loss and the emotional toll that this past year has taken.” The ARP ESSER state plans approved by the Department today, including New Jersey, show how states are using Federal pandemic resources to support safe in-person instruction and meet the social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs of students—with a focus on the students most impacted by the pandemic. For example: Supporting Students Most Impacted by the Pandemic: The New Jersey Department of Education (NJDOE) will provide guidance and technical assistance on the use of ARP ESSER funds that highlight how allowable activities may be used to advance educational equity. As part of their ARP ESSER Use of Funds application, LEAs will be required to provide information on their plans to use ARP ESSER funds to implement an equitable and inclusive return to in-person instruction. Addressing the Academic Impact of Lost Instructional Time: New Jersey plans to establish an “Acceleration Coach and Educator Support” formula grant for districts. New Jersey will use a weighted enrollment allocation formula that assigns additional weight to lower grade bands, Limited English Proficient Students, and students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch. Districts will use the grant funds to implement professional learning for staff to help better understand the needs of their students with regard to learning acceleration and interventions. Funds also will be used in developing positive school climate, implementing social and emotional learning supports, supporting culturally responsive teaching practices, increasing digital and data literacy, engaging educators and parents in the community to personalize students’ learning, identifying disproportionate impacts of COVID-19, and other services to support educators meeting the needs of their students. Investing in Summer Learning and Expanded Afterschool Programs: The state plans to develop a Summer Enrichment Activities formula grant to districts to support summer learning academies and tutoring, professional learning for educators, and education and training programs for parents and caregivers. Districts must target funds to content areas most impacted by COVID-19, such as STEM, younger grade levels, or performing arts. Additionally, the state plans to establish a Comprehensive Beyond the School Day Activities formula grant which will support implementation of research-based programs such as tutoring and broader learning supports to families and educators. A total of 46 states, and the District of Columbia, have submitted their ARP ESSER state plans to the Department. The Department is reviewing the plans expeditiously and is in contact with states to ensure their plans meet all necessary requirements in order to access the remaining funds, as outlined in the ARP.

Additionally, the Department approved plans for Alabama, Indiana, New Jersey, North Dakota, and South Carolina. Today’s approvals mean a total of 28 ARP ESSER state plans have been approved since June. The Department has approved plans supporting more than 50 percent of students nationwide. “I am excited to announce approval of Kentucky’s plan,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “It is heartening to see, reflected in these state plans, the ways in which states are thinking deeply about how to use American Rescue Plan funds to continue to provide critical support to schools and communities, particularly as we move into the summer and look ahead to the upcoming academic year. The approval of these plans enables states to receive vital, additional American Rescue Plan funds to quickly and safely reopen schools for full-time, in-person learning; meet students’ academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs; and address disparities in access to educational opportunity that were exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. The state plans that have been submitted to the Department lay the groundwork for the ways in which an unprecedented infusion of federal resources will be used to address the urgent needs of America’s children and build back better.” “I am grateful for the approval of Kentucky’s ARP ESSER plan,” said Jason E. Glass, commissioner of education, Kentucky Department of Education. “This plan will assist in the safe reopening and in-person operation of our schools, while addressing not only the academic needs of our students, but their social, emotional and mental health needs as well. Instead of returning to the traditional way of doing things, our priority is to return to a better than normal school year.” “The pandemic has presented countless challenges for students, parents, and educators over the past year and a half—both inside the classroom and out,” said Rep. John Yarmuth. “With a new school year starting, I am thrilled that the Department of Education has approved Kentucky’s transformative plan to assist schools in safely reopening, addressing learning loss, and providing key support to students and educators as our recovery continues. As the lead sponsor of the American Rescue Plan, I’m proud to have played a part in securing this funding—the largest one-time investment in K-12 education in our nation’s history.” The ARP ESSER state plans approved by the Department today, including Kentucky, show how states are using federal pandemic resources to support safe in-person instruction and meet the social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs of students—with a focus on the students most impacted by the pandemic. For example: Safely Reopening Schools and Sustaining Safe Operations: The Kentucky Department of Education (KDE) and the Kentucky Department of Public Health collaborated on more than 50 guidance documents, promoted early vaccination for the education workforce, and facilitated in the creation of COVID-19 vaccination sites at schools. Facemasks will be required in all preschool through 12th grade settings. Addressing the Academic Impact of Lost Instructional Time: KDE will offer professional development in literacy instruction for educators and staff, and increase student and teacher access to high-quality and instructional resources. KDE also has provided guidance and will offer technical assistance to implement accelerated learning summer programs with integrated social-emotional learning, high-intensity tutoring, and vacation academies. Investing in Summer Learning and Expanded Afterschool Programs: KDE is offering summer learning grants in 2021 to districts that provide comprehensive summer learning programs to expand access to populations disproportionately impacted by COVID-19, reduce financial and physical access barriers, and expand and improve programs. KDE will provide technical assistance and monitor effectiveness of these grantees. Additionally, KDE also will fund a summer enrichment program with AmeriCorps focused on outdoor environmental education activities. A total of 46 states, and the District of Columbia, have submitted their ARP ESSER state plans to the Department. The Department is reviewing the plans expeditiously and is in contact with states to ensure their plans meet all necessary requirements in order to access the remaining funds, as outlined in the ARP. The Department is also in contact with states that have not yet submitted plans, the vast majority of which are due to state board of education or legislative review requirements. The distribution of ARP ESSER funds is part of the Department’s broader effort to support students and districts as they work to reengage students impacted by the pandemic, address inequities exacerbated by COVID-19, and build our education system back better than before. In addition to providing $130 billion for K-12 education in the American Rescue Plan to support the safe reopening of K-12 schools and meet the needs of all students, the Biden-Harris Administration also has: Released three volumes of the COVID-19 Handbook. Held a National Safe School Reopening Summit . Prioritized the vaccination of educators, school staff and child care workers. As of the end of May an estimated 84% of teachers and school staff were fully vaccinated. Provided $10 billion in funding for COVID-19 testing for PreK-12 educators, staff, and students. Launched a series of Equity Summits focused on addressing inequities that existed before, but were made worse by the pandemic. Released a report on the disparate impacts of COVID-19 on underserved communities. Developed a Safer Schools and Campuses Best Practices Clearinghouse elevating hundreds of best practices to support schools’ efforts to reopen safely and address the impacts of COVID-19 on students, educators, and communities. In addition to the actions the Biden Administration has taken to reopen schools, the President has proposed critical investments through his Build Back Better agenda that will enable schools to rebuild stronger than they were before the pandemic, such as investing billions to build a diverse educator workforce, expand access to pre-K to all families, and invest in school infrastructure, among other provisions."

ARP funds can be used to support the roadmap’s efforts. Earlier this year, the Department distributed two thirds of the ARP ESSER funds, totaling $81 billion, to 50 states and the District of Columbia. The remaining third of the funding to states will be made available once state plans are approved. North Dakota is receiving $305 million total in ARP ESSER funds, and today’s approval of their plan will result in the release of the final $101 million.

Our North Dakota students must have opportunities to continue learning, and the students and their families who want extra supports must have them available, such as tutoring, summer school, and after-school programs. I am pleased that the U.S. Department of Education has recognized our work. Its approval of our ARP ESSER plan shows the Department agrees with our direction and priorities.” The ARP ESSER state plans approved by the Department today, including North Dakota, show how states are using federal pandemic resources to support safe in-person instruction and meet the social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs of students—with a focus on the students most impacted by the pandemic. For example: Safely Reopening Schools and Sustaining Safe Operations: The North Dakota Department of Public InstructionNDDPI) worked together with North Dakota Department of Health (NDDOH), the North Dakota United Teachers’ Union, and school districts to communicate with educators about available vaccination options. A COVID Vaccine Locator was developed by the NDDOH to assist individuals in identifying vaccine availability near them. A vaccine video resource library was also developed and included resources and videos on a variety of topics that included COVID-19 updates and information. Investing in Early Learning: NDDPI is partnering with North Dakota Department of Human Services to use $7 million of ARP ESSER funds to offer high-quality, well-resourced classrooms for 4-year-olds through grants of $120,000 available to public, private, and religious organizations. Addressing the Academic Impact of Lost Instructional Time: NDDPI will implement several evidenced-based interventions, such as summer school, Comprehensive Literacy State Development grants, development of priority standards, and the Innovation Zone Project, which addresses unfinished learning by blending adaptive digital and online curriculums with traditional classroom instruction. Evidence-based interventions also will include several reading and early learning programs, and Exact Path, an online tool that combines adaptive diagnostics with individualized instruction and learning paths for K-12 students.

I am pleased the Democrats’ American Rescue Plan has provided these critical resources to schools as they are gearing up for the third academic year faced with the uncertainty of this virulent virus,” Rep. James E. Clyburn said. “Ensuring our students are able to learn in a safe and healthy environment should be our top priority. I commend Secretary Cardona and the U.S. Department of Education’s work to get these resources distributed efficiently, effectively and equitably, so that students in South Carolina can have confidence that the federal government is looking out for their health and safety.” The ARP ESSER state plans approved by the Department today, including South Carolina, show how states are using federal pandemic resources to support safe in-person instruction and meet the social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs of students—with a focus on the students most impacted by the pandemic. For example: Safely Reopening Schools and Sustaining Safe Operations: The South Carolina Department of Education (SCDE) partnered with the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control to promote a vaccine confidence campaign among the state’s families, educators, and school communities. The campaign includes a communication’s toolkit, answers to frequently asked questions, and vaccination events tailored to schools and communities. The agencies also have provided school operational guidance ahead of the upcoming school year based on lessons learned from the pandemic and the latest public health guidance. Focusing on Early Learning: SCDE plans to provide training and instructional materials to schools where 33% or more of 3rd graders scored in the lowest performance level on the 2019 state summative reading or language arts assessment. The training and materials must meet evidence-based criteria in the science of reading. SCDE will partner with SC First Steps to School Readiness to support transitioning students into pre-k and kindergarten, recruit and retain pre-K teachers, engage parents, and monitor the health of early learners through early identification and referrals. Addressing the Academic Impact of Lost Instructional Time: SCDE will work with partners to provide high dosage tutoring to students, identified through data, who have been most impacted by COVID-19. Additionally, SCDE will partner with the SC Commission on Higher Education and Technical College Board to develop pathways to post-secondary education and will engage local communities in identifying adults who have not earned a diploma and provide online access and support on the GED and family literacy. SCDE will also support adult education students who were disconnected from the education process during the pandemic and support these adults in earning a GED.

10-Aug-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-takes-action-student-aid-violations-and-school-closure,U.S. Department of Education Takes Action on Student Aid Violations and School Closure,"Today, the U.S. Department of Education's office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) issued Final Program Review Determinations to two schools: RWM Fiber Optics, Inc. and Harrison College. In each instance, FSA identified more than $2.5 million in liabilities, resulting from multiple violations by RWM and from the closing of Harrison, respectively. “All institutions are expected to serve the best interests of their students, not serve themselves,” said FSA Chief Operating Officer Richard Cordray. “Schools that engage in bad behavior or that suddenly close their doors, leaving students out in the cold, will be held accountable, and we expect other schools to pay attention to the actions we are taking today.” RWM Fiber Optics, Inc. (RWM) In September 2018, FSA conducted a routine program review at RWM to evaluate the school’s compliance with the federal statutes and regulations that govern the student aid programs. During the review, FSA examined RWM’s processes and identified 16 specific violations, including numerous instances where school officials falsified information or improperly retained credit balances that were actually owed to the students. FSA determined that these violations were “egregious” efforts to illegally obtain federal student aid funds. In particular, FSA found that the school falsified FAFSA information to make it appear students were eligible to receive financial aid to which they were not entitled. RWM listed nonexistent dependents to inflate student aid awards, and it fictionalized high school diplomas or GED credentials that some students did not earn. RWM also improperly created student aid account usernames and passwords without students’ knowledge or consent, and the school submitted FAFSA information without allowing students to review or certify its accuracy. Among other violations, FSA determined that RWM improperly paid students with Federal Work-Study Program funds to clean bathrooms, pick up garbage, and clean the building, even though these tasks did not help students develop in their professions as the program requires. Further, RWM failed to pay students credit balance refunds on a timely basis or in lump sums as required by law. Some students did not receive their credit balance funds until they graduated. FSA found that RWM owes the Department more than $2.4 million in liabilities, which cover all Title IV program funds disbursed for the 2015–16, 2016–17, and 2017–18 award years. RWM’s participation in federal student aid programs ended in December 2018, and the school closed. Harrison College (Harrison) In September 2018, Harrison announced its immediate closure of 11 campuses in Indiana and Ohio affecting approximately 2,100 students. The institution cited declining enrollment and financial concerns as factors for its sudden closure. Harrison’s financial composite score deteriorated rapidly between its fiscal years ending June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2018. Student loan borrowers enrolled at Harrison when it closed (or who withdrew within 120 days before it closed) and unable to complete their program of study because of the closure, may apply for a discharge of their federal student loans. Parents who borrowed a PLUS loan for a student enrolled at Harrison may also apply for a discharge. When Harrison closed, FSA conducted outreach to help students understand their options. Today, FSA finds that Harrison is liable for more than $3.6 million that taxpayers paid to discharge William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program loans on behalf of borrowers who applied for and received closed school loan discharges. That amount is in addition to more than $2.9 million in closed school discharges that FSA previously assessed to Harrison following a final audit. Today’s actions underscore the Department’s commitment to protecting students and taxpayers from poor-performing programs. Last week, the Department announced its intent to form a negotiated rulemaking committee to address issues affecting student loan borrowers, including borrower defense to repayment for students harmed by their colleges’ misleading practices, loan repayment, and improving the rules governing targeted student loan cancellation, including closed school discharge."
9-Aug-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/new-interpretation-encourage-state-collaboration-student-loan-servicing,New Interpretation to Encourage State Collaboration on Student Loan Servicing,"Today, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) released a new legal interpretation that revises and clarifies its position on the legality of state laws and regulations that govern various aspects of the servicing of federal student loans. This action will help states enforce borrower bills of rights or other similar laws to address issues with servicing of federal student loans. This change is part of Federal Student Aid's (FSA's) efforts to strengthen the student loan program by enhancing oversight and accountability for student loan servicers in order to protect students, borrowers, and taxpayers. The interpretation will take effect this week, but the Department is also seeking public comment on the notice for the next 30 days so it can identify any additional changes that may be needed. ""Helping more students afford college is a top priority, and effective collaboration among the states and federal government is the best way to ensure that student loan borrowers get the best possible service,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""We welcome public input on this interpretation and look forward to enhancing consumer protections for student loan borrowers by clarifying the relationship between federal and state law on this issue."" Under Secretary Cardona's leadership, the Department is committed to using every tool to protect federal student loan borrowers, including maintaining strong partnerships with state regulators. The proposed notice clarifies that while federal law does preempt state regulation in certain narrow areas, states can regulate student loan servicing in many other ways without being preempted by the federal Higher Education Act (HEA). ""States have long played an integral role in higher education oversight and have been on the front lines of protecting student borrowers from fraud and abuse,"" said Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey. ""We applaud Secretary Cardona for rejecting the previous interpretation that inaccurately represented the states' authority and emboldened bad actors. Our residents deserve a strong federal-state partnership, and my office looks forward to collaborating with the Department to ensure servicer accountability and borrower rights."" Today's action replaces a prior notice of interpretation posted in the Federal Register on March 12, 2018. That notice stated that the HEA broadly preempted state efforts to regulate student loan servicers and has been uniformly rejected by the courts. The notice published today adopts an interpretation that is more consistent with case law on federal preemption and the Department's longstanding practice. The proposed notice of interpretation can be found here . It will be published in the Federal Register this week, and the public will have 30 days to submit comments. Today's announcement builds on the Biden Administration's previous efforts to protect student loan borrowers and to renew partnerships with state and federal regulators. On May 28, 2021, FSA's Chief Operating Officer Richard Cordray announced revised guidance to FSA vendors making it easier for state attorneys general and regulators to get the information they need from FSA and from student loan servicers to conduct oversight."

The Department believes this additional time and a definitive end date will allow borrowers to plan for the resumption of payments and reduce the risk of delinquency and defaults after restart. The Department will continue its work to transition borrowers smoothly back into repayment, including by improving student loan servicing. ""The payment pause has been a lifeline that allowed millions of Americans to focus on their families, health, and finances instead of student loans during the national emergency,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""As our nation’s economy continues to recover from a deep hole, this final extension will give students and borrowers the time they need to plan for restart and ensure a smooth pathway back to repayment. It is the Department’s priority to support students and borrowers during this transition and ensure they have the resources they need to access affordable, high quality higher education."" The Department will begin notifying borrowers about this final extension in the coming days, and it will release resources and information about how to plan for payment restart as the end of the pause approaches. Today’s action is one of a series of steps the Department has taken to support students and borrowers, make higher education more affordable, and improve student loan servicing, including: Approving $1.5 billion in borrower defense claims, including extending full relief to approved claims and approving new types of claims. Reinstating $1.3 billion in loan discharges for 41,000 borrowers who received a total and permanent disability discharge and protecting another 190,000 from potential loan reinstatement. Helping 30,000 small business owners with student loans seeking help from the Paycheck Protection Program."

New Hampshire’s plan details how the state is using and plans to use ARP ESSER funds to safely reopen and sustain the safe operation of schools and equitably expand opportunity for students who need it most, particularly those most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. As schools and states gear up for the return to school, the Department released the Return To School Roadmap , which provides key resources and supports for students, parents, educators, and school communities to build excitement around returning to classrooms this school year and outlines how federal funding can support the safe and sustained return to in-person learning. ARP funds can be used to support the roadmap’s efforts. Earlier this year, the Department distributed two thirds of the ARP ESSER funds, totaling $81 billion, to 50 states and the District of Columbia. The remaining third of the funding to states will be made available once state plans are approved. New Hampshire is receiving more than $233 million total in ARP ESSER funds, and today’s approval of their plan will result in the release of the final $116 million. Additionally, the Department approved plans for Hawaii, Montana, New York, and Pennsylvania. Today’s approvals mean a total of 22 ARP ESSER state plans have been approved since June. “I am excited to announce approval of New Hampshire’s plan,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “It is heartening to see, reflected in these state plans, the ways in which states are thinking deeply about how to use American Rescue Plan funds to continue to provide critical support to schools and communities, particularly as we move into the summer and look ahead to the upcoming academic year. The approval of these plans enables states to receive vital, additional American Rescue Plan funds to quickly and safely reopen schools for full-time, in-person learning; meet students’ academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs; and address disparities in access to educational opportunity that were exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. The state plans that have been submitted to the Department lay the groundwork for the ways in which an unprecedented infusion of federal resources will be used to address the urgent needs of America’s children and build back better.” “New Hampshire learners, families, and educators have demonstrated incredible resilience and dedication throughout the past year and half, and we are excited to return to school safely and in-person this fall,” said New Hampshire Commissioner of Education Frank Edelblut. “Through innovation and individualized instruction and supports, the New Hampshire Department of Education, our schools, and our community-based organizations have leveraged these unprecedented resources to meet the needs of students in all educational environments. We are proud of our learner-centered approach to realizing the Granite State’s vision for education—‘Live Free and Learn.’ ” “The COVID-19 pandemic has had an all-encompassing impact on New Hampshire schools. Our kids, families and teachers experienced immense challenges, which is why securing robust federal relief for our schools to address these obstacles was a top priority for me during negotiations for the American Rescue Plan,” said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen. “The approval of New Hampshire’s ESSER plan is an important step that will enable the state to use these additional funds to help students and faculty return safely to school in the fall, address learning loss incurred during the course of the pandemic, meet students’ needs and more. I’ll keep fighting to ensure Granite State schools, teachers, and staff have the resources they need to help our students turn the corner of this crisis.” “Granite State students and teachers have shown incredible resiliency during the pandemic, and it is important that we help them stay safe this fall for in-person learning,” said Sen. Maggie Hassan. “That is why Congress worked to pass critical education resources in the American Rescue Plan, and I am pleased that the U.S. Department of Education approved New Hampshire’s spending plan to help meet students’ academic, social, and emotional needs. I will continue to work with my colleagues to help our young people thrive.” The ARP ESSER state plans approved by the Department today, including New Hampshire, show how states are using federal pandemic resources to support safe in-person instruction and meet the social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs of students—with a focus on the students most impacted by the pandemic. For example: Investing in Expanded Afterschool Programs: The New Hampshire Department of Education (NHDOE) is considering using ARP ESSER funds to partner with multiple community-based organizations and schools to provide wraparound services, such as digital literacy and joint family instruction, to low-income students and English learners, and provide high-quality afterschool STEM enrichment, including robotics. NHDOE is also considering expanding its ReKINDling Curiosity program, which provides low-income students and students with disabilities the opportunity to attend a licensed New Hampshire camp. Supporting Students’ and Educators Social, Emotional, and Mental Health Needs: The state education agency has contracted with the New Hampshire Community Behavioral Health Association and the Association for the State Community Mental Health Centers. Through this $500,000 contract, all New Hampshire camp counselors (ages 14 and up) can access training this year and next year to help identify and respond to the mental and behavioral health issues of students. Supporting Educators: NHDOE will utilize its critical shortage survey results that will be collected in October 2021 to evaluate if higher than normal levels of retirement and attrition are resulting from the pandemic. This will inform strategies to support the teacher workforce and future teacher recruitment. The NHDOE also rolled out an extensive training program to all educators to help equip and provide them with tools for online instruction, including a statewide learning management system and high-quality instructional materials for all students and educators. A total of 44 states and the District of Columbia have submitted their ARP ESSER state plans to the Department. The Department is reviewing the plans expeditiously and is in contact with states to ensure their plans meet all necessary requirements in order to access the remaining funds, as outlined in the ARP. The Department also is in contact with states that have not yet submitted plans, the vast majority of which are due to state board of education or legislative review requirements. The distribution of ARP ESSER funds is part of the Department’s broader effort to support students and districts as they work to reengage students impacted by the pandemic, address inequities exacerbated by COVID-19, and build our education system back better than before. In addition to providing $130 billion for K-12 education in the American Rescue Plan to support the safe reopening of K-12 schools and meet the needs of all students, the Biden-Harris Administration also has: Released three volumes of the COVID-19 Handbook. Held a National Safe School Reopening Summit . Prioritized the vaccination of educators, school staff and child care workers. As of the end of May an estimated 84% of teachers and school staff were fully vaccinated. Provided $10 billion in funding for COVID-19 testing for PreK-12 educators, staff, and students. Launched a series of Equity Summits focused on addressing inequities that existed before, but were made worse by the pandemic. Released a report on the disparate impacts of COVID-19 on underserved communities. Developed a Safer Schools and Campuses Best Practices Clearinghouse elevating hundreds of best practices to support schools’ efforts to reopen safely and address the impacts of COVID-19 on students, educators, and communities. In addition to the actions the Biden Administration has taken to reopen schools, the President has proposed critical investments through his Build Back Better agenda that will enable schools to rebuild stronger than they were before the pandemic, such as investing billions to build a diverse educator workforce, expand access to pre-K to all families, and invest in school infrastructure, among other provisions."

ARP ESSER funds invest in our schools now and will enable them to further develop and implement lasting critical academic, social, and emotional resources, programs, and supports. The Pennsylvania Department of Education looks forward to continuing to collaborate with and provide assistance to schools as they navigate, overcome the impacts of, and emerge stronger from the pandemic.” “The pandemic created great disruptions in our education system, leaving schools with the significant task of keeping their communities safe, while also meeting the academic and social-emotional needs of their students. Recognizing the substantial challenges that remain ahead and the critical importance of bringing students back into the classroom, the Biden-Harris Administration and Congress included bold investments for K-12 schools in the American Rescue Plan,” said Sen. Bob Casey. “I am pleased to see that the Department of Education has approved Pennsylvania’s plan. The school year is quickly approaching, and these resources will help ensure that our children can safely return to school in the fall and receive the support they need to succeed after a challenging year.” “Students, educators, and our communities urgently need the funding from the American Rescue Plan in order to address learning loss and difficulties created by the pandemic,” said Rep. Susan Wild. “I’m glad to see the Department of Education approve Pennsylvania’s plan to use this funding so we can get kids back on track as quickly and safely as possible.” The ARP ESSER state plans approved by the Department today, including Pennsylvania, show how states are using federal pandemic resources to support safe in-person instruction and meet the social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs of students—with a focus on the students most impacted by the pandemic. For example: Addressing the Academic and Other Impacts of Lost Instructional Time: The Pennsylvania state budget allocated the ARP ESSER reserve for evidence-based interventions to address the academic and other impacts of lost instructional time as subgrants. PDE will provide a list of vetted evidence-based interventions through its Evidence Resource Center. PDE is emphasizing the use of ARP ESSER funds for social, emotional, and mental health supports; professional development and technical assistance to educators, school support staff, school leaders, and school health professionals; and reading support and improvement for students. Subrecipients will be required to use at least 30 percent of the required state set-side for addressing the academic impact of lost instructional time to support students’ social, emotional, and mental health needs. Using ARP ESSER funding, PDE has developed guidance and planning tools to support subrecipients in evaluating and addressing the pandemic’s disproportionate impact on vulnerable students and communities. Investing in Summer Learning and Expanded Afterschool Programs: PDE will allocate summer enrichment and comprehensive afterschool formula grants to school districts, available through the ARP ESSER funding period. Interventions will include activities such as learning academies, 1:1 tutoring, socialization, and development of social-emotional skills and growth mindsets. School districts will be required to target funds to student groups disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. A total of 44 states and the District of Columbia have submitted their ARP ESSER state plans to the Department. The Department is reviewing the plans expeditiously and is in contact with states to ensure their plans meet all necessary requirements in order to access the remaining funds, as outlined in the ARP.

Young, Jr. “I thank President Biden and our Congressional delegation for securing these funds and the stakeholders across the state that submitted valuable feedback as we developed our plan.” “New York’s plan creates a roadmap of how the state intends to use ARP ESSER funds to safely open and maintain a safe operation of schools this September,” said New York State Education Commissioner Betty A. Rosa. “With input from stakeholders, we have developed a plan to best disperse these funds to benefit all students, regardless of where they live or their socioeconomic status.” “COVID brought unprecedented challenges to our students, teachers, and families—this required a bold response from Congress,” said Sen. Charles E. Schumer. “As Majority Leader, I was proud to make funding for our schools a top priority in the American Rescue Plan and to deliver historic levels of support. These resources will deliver much needed aid that will allow schools to implement public health protocols to safely reopen, and address students’ learning loss, and meet students’ long-term academic, social, and emotional needs. I am pleased to see the Department of Education approve New York’s plan. Help is on the way for New York schools.” “The ongoing pandemic has disrupted learning across New York State and has put thousands of children at risk of falling behind in their education and development,” said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand. “I am proud to have worked hand in hand with the Biden-Harris Administration to secure these resources in the American Rescue Plan, which will help get students back to school safely and back on track with their education this fall. Every child deserves a quality education, and I am committed to closing the learning gap in New York and across the country.” “New York’s Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Plan will ensure we have the resources to safely reopen our schools and deliver critical support services to the students and families who have been most impacted by the pandemic,” said Rep. Joe Morelle. “I am grateful to the U.S. Department of Education for their swift approval of the state’s proposal, and I am proud to have helped secure this funding as part of the American Rescue Plan.” “The lives of our students and their families were completely upended as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. It presented unprecedented challenges that required unprecedented action from the Biden-Harris Administration and Congress,” said Rep. Adriano Espaillat. “We heeded that call to action with passage of the American Rescue Plan, delivering much needed resources to our constituents who needed them most. Learning loss and widening of the education gap over the past year and a half of this public health emergency have made the return of students to the classroom a top priority. I appreciate the New York State Department of Education putting forward an inclusive, thoughtful, and collaborative plan for the 2021-2022 school year and its approval by Secretary Cardona and the U.S. Department of Education. This money will help us get our children safely back in school and begin to address the social and emotional toll that this harrowing past year has had on our students, our educators, and our communities—and through it, building back better, and stronger than ever before.” The ARP ESSER state plans approved by the Department today, including New York, show how states are using federal pandemic resources to support safe in-person instruction and meet the social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs of students—with a focus on the students most impacted by the pandemic. For example: Addressing the Academic Impact of Lost Instructional Time, Investing in Summer Learning, and Expanding Afterschool Programs: The 2021-2022 enacted state budget fully allocated the ARP ESSER funds reserved to address the academic impact of lost instructional time, investing in summer learning through the ARP ESSER funding period, and expanding afterschool programs as subgrants to 398 high-need school districts. The New York State Education Department (NYSED) will require districts to utilize subgrant funds to implement evidence-based interventions. NYSED will provide technical assistance to support implementation and will monitor progress. Investing in Early Learning: NYSED will invest $195 million of its emergency reserve funds to fund new full-day prekindergarten programs for 4-year-olds and expand existing programs. The pandemic dramatically impacted pre-school children as many daycare, pre-school, and enrichment programs closed for much of the past year. NYSED will expand opportunities for 4-year-olds to attend free, public pre-K programs where they will be able to catch up on lost early childhood learning, socialization, and other foundational skills required for long-term success. A crucial goal of these programs will be to accelerate learning to mitigate the impact of lost instructional time and help close pre-existing performance gaps. Supporting Students’ and Educators Social, Emotional, and Mental Health Needs: NYSED collaborates with the Mental Health Association of New York State to provide districts with Mental Health First Aid training. Mental Health First Aid is a public education program that introduces participants to risk factors and warning signs of mental illnesses, builds understanding of their impact, and overviews common supports. NYSED also adapted trainings to focus on integrating social-emotional learning (SEL) and trauma-responsive practices into remote learning environments, where needed, in order to support development of students’ SEL competencies related to self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship skills, and reasonable decision making. A total of 44 states and the District of Columbia have submitted their ARP ESSER state plans to the Department.

I thank Secretary Cardona and his team for granting approval to Montana’s state plan and placing trust in our local control model.” “As I’ve talked with families and educators over the past year, one thing has been crystal clear: this pandemic hit Montana students hard, and we must do everything we can to help get them caught up,” said Sen. Jon Tester. “That’s why I was proud to support the American Rescue Plan, and why I fought to secure this urgently-needed support that will help Montana schools reopen safely and get students back on track when school starts this fall—all without breaking the bank for local taxpayers.” The ARP ESSER state plans approved by the Department today, including Montana, show how states are using federal pandemic resources to support safe in-person instruction and meet the social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs of students—with a focus on the students most impacted by the pandemic. For example: Addressing the Academic Impact of Lost Instructional Time, Investing in Summer Learning and Expanding Afterschool Programs: The Montana Office of Public Instruction (OPI) has allocated funds to school districts to invest in evidence-based programs and is providing tools to help school districts decide how to select interventions. OPI will provide a variety of sustained, multi-tiered systems of supports, professional learning, data support, and technical assistance opportunities to school districts to support their academic impact plans and implementation. OPI will use the Opportunity to Learn Survey collected in May 2021 and the Professional Needs Survey collected in February 2021, along with data collected at the local level, to identify student groups disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. Districts will submit specific action plans to target those students, such as afterschool or summer school programs. OPI also is partnering with community-based organizations like the YMCA, Boys and Girls Clubs, and local libraries to support summer and afterschool programs. Expanding Summer Enrichment Opportunities: OPI is developing summer enrichment opportunities for Montana students based on student-driven interests and purpose. The first student film festival will be held the summer of 2022 and will be enhanced with afterschool workshops developing student interests and skills in digital media and communication. The Montana Arts Council, the Department of Labor, the Chamber of Commerce, and Reach Higher are all partners in this effort. OPI will release a summer enrichment planning guide for public and nonpublic schools and communities this fall. Supporting Students’ and Educators Social, Emotional, and Mental Health Needs: Social, emotional, and behavioral supports and guidance are embedded throughout resources published by OPI. OPI also held virtual meetings for the Montana School Counselors Association that continued throughout spring 2020 focusing on school counseling, screening, and social emotional learning in partnership with the Montana School Counselors Association. Additionally, OPI is encouraging schools to utilize the additional funding received from COVID-19 relief to add personnel to their schools as deemed necessary through local needs assessments, including counselors.

Today’s approvals mean a total of 22 ARP ESSER state plans have been approved since June. “I am excited to announce approval of Hawaii’s plan,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “It is heartening to see, reflected in these state plans, the ways in which states are thinking deeply about how to use American Rescue Plan funds to continue to provide critical support to schools and communities, particularly as we move into the summer and look ahead to the upcoming academic year. The approval of these plans enables states to receive vital, additional American Rescue Plan funds to quickly and safely reopen schools for full-time, in-person learning; meet students’ academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs; and address disparities in access to educational opportunity that were exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. The state plans that have been submitted to the Department lay the groundwork for the ways in which an unprecedented infusion of federal resources will be used to address the urgent needs of America’s children and build back better.” “The U.S. Department of Education’s continued investment in Hawaii’s public schools throughout the pandemic has provided us with a degree of certainty in very uncertain times. We are committed to using these resources to, in turn, invest in our students and their futures,” said Interim Superintendent Keith T. Hayashi. “Our priorities are centered around our efforts to safely begin the new school year with in-person learning to support the academic, social, and emotional needs of our students.” The ARP ESSER state plans approved by the Department today, including Hawaii, show how states are using Federal pandemic resources to support safe in-person instruction and meet the social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs of students—with a focus on the students most impacted by the pandemic. For example: Safely Reopening Schools and Sustaining Safe Operations: The Hawaii State Department of Education (HIDOE) will continue to collaborate with the Hawaii State Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on guidance for schools, complex areas, and state offices. HIDOE has worked with the state Department of Health and local healthcare providers to host vaccination clinics for staff, students, and school communities across the state. HIDOE has hosted 45 vaccination clinics since students became eligible for the vaccine. Supporting Students Most Impacted by the Pandemic: Using ARP ESSER funds, HIDOE will implement strategies to reengage students in in-person learning, such as through high-interest programs like Hawaiian Education or performing arts and funding academic coaches to provide more intensive individualized supports to students who are struggling to reengage in learning. Addressing the Academic Impact of Lost Instructional Time: To address the academic impact of loss instructional time and ensure that interventions implemented respond to students’ academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs, HIDOE will: Implement high-dosage tutoring extended learning time, academic coaching, and opportunities for credit recovery and remediation. Finalize a learning acceleration framework to provide guidance to schools, complex areas, and state offices to mitigate learning loss. Implement an accelerated personalized learning program that will target students who are behind grade level in mathematics or language arts, including individualized tutoring support, academic coaching, and personalized approaches to engagement and support services. Consider using funds in the development of COVID-19 Impact Plans for students with disabilities, which provide services in addition to Individualized Education Program (IEP) services that may extend beyond the school day. Services include tutoring, small group instruction, behavior supports, and other personalized supports as identified by the IEP team. Implement transition programs to help students transition to their next school, such as a summer state kindergarten transition program. A total of 44 states and the District of Columbia have submitted their ARP ESSER state plans to the Department. The Department is reviewing the plans expeditiously and is in contact with states to ensure their plans meet all necessary requirements in order to access the remaining funds, as outlined in the ARP. The Department also is in contact with states that have not yet submitted plans, the vast majority of which are due to state board of education or legislative review requirements. The distribution of ARP ESSER funds is part of the Department’s broader effort to support students and districts as they work to reengage students impacted by the pandemic, address inequities exacerbated by COVID-19, and build our education system back better than before. In addition to providing $130 billion for K-12 education in the American Rescue Plan to support the safe reopening of K-12 schools and meet the needs of all students, the Biden-Harris Administration also has: Released three volumes of the COVID-19 Handbook. Held a National Safe School Reopening Summit . Prioritized the vaccination of educators, school staff and child care workers. As of the end of May an estimated 84% of teachers and school staff were fully vaccinated. Provided $10 billion in funding for COVID-19 testing for PreK-12 educators, staff, and students. Launched a series of Equity Summits focused on addressing inequities that existed before, but were made worse by the pandemic. Released a report on the disparate impacts of COVID-19 on underserved communities. Developed a Safer Schools and Campuses Best Practices Clearinghouse elevating hundreds of best practices to support schools’ efforts to reopen safely and address the impacts of COVID-19 on students, educators, and communities. In addition to the actions the Biden Administration has taken to reopen schools, the President has proposed critical investments through his Build Back Better agenda that will enable schools to rebuild stronger than they were before the pandemic, such as investing billions to build a diverse educator workforce, expand access to pre-K to all families, and invest in school infrastructure, among other provisions."
3-Aug-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-awards-10-million-projects-train-and-recruit-qualified-native-american-educators,U.S. Department of Education Awards $10 Million in Projects to Train and Recruit Qualified Native American Educators,"Today, the U.S. Department of Education awarded 29 grants totaling $10 million through the Indian Education Professional Development (PD) program. These grants to colleges and universities throughout the nation, including tribal colleges and universities, address a significant gap in the number of qualified Native American (Native) individuals in education-related professions that serve Native students. “Representation matters. All students deserve the opportunity to be taught by educators who are diverse and who reflect their backgrounds and experiences—and we know that far too few Native American students have the chance to engage with Native American teachers in their schools and as education leaders and mentors in their communities. That must change,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “I am heartened that this program will help to create a more diverse educator workforce for students across the country and support efforts to recruit and retain more talented Native American teachers and administrators for our schools.” Each project addresses unique conditions for Native students to have equitable access to well-prepared educators and a more diverse teacher and administrator workforce. Projects help develop and implement initiatives to prepare and retain Native teachers and administrators, with an emphasis on training and professional development that addresses the unique academic and cultural needs of Native students. These grants increase professional development for teachers and administrators to support their efforts to design and implement initiatives that help low-achieving Native students improve their academic achievement, outcomes, and preparation for postsecondary education or employment. Allowable activities under this program empower Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs), Local Education Agencies (LEAs), Indian Tribes or Organizations, and State Education Agencies (SEAs) to: Increase the number of qualified Native individuals in professions that serve in school districts, including charter and Bureau of Indian Education schools, that have a high proportion of Native students; Provide pre- and in-service training and support to qualified Native individuals to become effective teachers or education administrators; Improve the skills of qualified Native individuals who serve in the education field; and Develop and implement two-year induction services initiatives to promote retention of effective Native teachers, principals, and school leaders who have a record of success in helping low-achieving Native students improve their academic achievement, outcomes, and preparation for postsecondary education or employment. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) of 1965 was amended in 1974 to provide the then-U.S. Commissioner of Education the ability to make special grants “with institutions of higher education, Indian organizations, and Indian tribes for the purpose of preparing individuals for teaching or administering special programs and projects designed to meet the special educational needs of Indian children and to provide in-service training for persons teaching in such programs.” This amendment recognized the importance of increasing the number of qualified Native individuals available to teach Native children. To date, the PD program has remained in effect benefiting over 1,700 pre-service individuals since 2013. More information about this program can be found at: https://oese.ed.gov/offices/office-of-indian-education/indian-education-professional-development/ .

3-Aug-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/white-house-initiative-historically-black-colleges-and-universities-announces-2021-hbcu-scholars,White House Initiative on Historically Black Colleges and Universities Announces 2021 HBCU Scholars,"The White House Initiative on Historically Black Colleges and Universities (Initiative) today announced its eighth cohort of HBCU Scholars. This program recognizes 86 undergraduate, graduate, and professional students for their accomplishments in academics, leadership, civic engagement and much more. Currently enrolled at 54 of our nation's HBCUs, the scholars were selected from an applicant pool of over 200 students who submitted completed applications that included a transcript, resume, essay, and letter of recommendation. Applications also required the signature of their university president, adding a level of prestige to this application process. ""The HBCU Scholars announced today all have demonstrated remarkable dedication to their learning and exemplify the talent that our nation's Historically Black Colleges and Universities have nurtured for generations,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""The students who hold this honor are committed to creating a more just and equitable society through their civic engagement. They are leaders and change-makers in their communities, and I cannot wait to learn from them as they serve as ambassadors both for the White House Initiative and their institutions of higher education."" ""As President of the State of Florida's first Historically Black College or University I am exceedingly pleased to support the tremendous work of the Initiative in its most recent selection and recognition of the nation's highest achieving scholar students from across our 105 historic institutions,"" said Edward Waters University President & CEO, Dr. A. Zachary Faison, Jr. ""The White House Initiative on Historically Black Colleges and Universities Scholars Program's longstanding commitment and emphasis upon platforming the very best and brightest amongst our students and showcasing their exceptional high scholarship and demonstrable leadership on a national stage speaks directly not only to the continuing contemporaneous relevance of HBCUs but equally underscores the uncontroverted depth of extraordinary talent that our institutions continue to produce and possess."" Over the course of an academic school year, the HBCU Scholars selected through this program will serve as ambassadors of the Initiative and their respected institution. The Initiative will provide scholars with information about the value of education as well as networking opportunities. Scholars can also share these resources with their fellow students. Through their relationships with community-based organizations, and public and private partners, all of which are gained through this recognition, scholars will also share promising and proven practices that support opportunities for all young people to achieve their educational and career potential. This cohort of HBCU Scholars will also participate in national and regional events and monthly classes with Elyse Jones, HBCU Scholar Program Coordinator, Initiative staff and other professionals from a wide range of disciplines. All HBCU Scholar events are designed to connect HBCU students with non-profit, business, and federal leaders to discuss professional development while identifying challenges and providing equitable solutions to barriers that HBCU students face when preparing and entering the 21st century workforce. ""Supporting the next generation of student leaders who will continue their education and graduate from HBCUs has been the highlight and joy of my career with the Initiative"" says Elyse Jones, HBCU Scholar Program Coordinator. ""It is my honor to announce these 86 students who will continue to make meaningful contributions to our country. Each student selected into this program has demonstrated their commitment to their academic achievements and improving their communities. I look forward to working with them as partners I can't wait to see what they will do as leaders."" Selected HBCU Scholars will be invited to the 2021 HBCU Week National Annual Conference, which will take place September 7-10, 2021. This year's conference theme is ""Exploring Equity."" During their time at the conference, they will participate in sessions about entrepreneurship, innovation, and personal and professional development. Most importantly, they will also have opportunities to engage with one another and showcase their individual and collective talent across the HBCU community. More information about the HBCU Scholars' activities will be provided in the coming months as they serve as ambassadors of the White House Initiative on Historically Black colleges and Universities.

2-Aug-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-releases-%E2%80%9Creturn-school-roadmap%E2%80%9D-support-students-schools-educators-and-communities-preparing-2021-2022-school-year,"U.S. Department of Education Releases “Return to School Roadmap” to Support Students, Schools, Educators, and Communities in Preparing for the 2021-2022 School Year","Today, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) released the “Return to School Roadmap,” a resource to support students, schools, educators, and communities as they prepare to return to safe, healthy in-person learning this fall and emerge from the pandemic stronger than before. The Roadmap provides key resources and supports for students, parents, educators, and school communities to build excitement around returning to classrooms this school year and outlines how federal funding can support the safe and sustained return to in-person learning. Over the course of the next several weeks as schools reopen nationwide, the Roadmap will lay out actionable strategies to implement the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) updated guidance for K-12 schools, so that schools can minimize transmission and sustain in-person learning all school-year long. The Roadmap includes three “Landmark” priorities that schools, districts, and communities are encouraged to focus on to ensure all students are set up for success in the 2021-2022 school year. These include: (1) prioritizing the health and safety of students, staff, and educators, (2) building school communities and supporting students’ social, emotional, and mental health, and (3) accelerating academic achievement. As part of the Roadmap, the Department will release resources for practitioners and parents on each of these priorities, and will highlight schools and districts that are using innovative practices to address these priorities. The Department will also lift up ways that the American Rescue Plan and other federal funds can be used to address these priorities in schools and communities across the country, as well as outline additional investments from President Biden’s Build Back Better agenda that are needed to ensure our schools and communities can rebuild from the pandemic even stronger than they were before and address inequities exacerbated by the pandemic, particularly for students in underserved communities. “Over the past year-and-a-half, as a nation, we experienced struggles like never before. Schools, teachers, students, and families were challenged in ways none of us ever imagined. But from that struggle, came resilience. Teachers, principals, school staff, parents, and – mostly importantly – our nation’s students rose to the occasion. They demonstrated what is possible if we follow key mitigation strategies to keep our students and school communities safe. Now, we must use our renewed strength to focus on what matters most: winning the fight against COVID-19, getting our students back in classrooms for full-time in-person learning—together—and making our education system better than ever before so that all students receive the excellent education they deserve,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “I’m proud to be releasing these tools to help make sure students, parents, schools, educators, and communities receive the communication and supports they need to make this academic year a success, and I want all schools this year to lead with a clear focus on health and safety, student wellbeing, and academic acceleration as students return to classrooms nationwide.” The release of the Roadmap builds upon President Biden’s call to increase vaccinations among adolescents as students go back to school. Last week, the President called on school districts nationwide to host at least one pop-up vaccination clinic over the coming weeks, and the Administration directed pharmacies in the federal pharmacy program to prioritize this and to work with school districts across the country to host vaccination clinics at schools and colleges. Vaccination is our leading public health strategy to end the COVID-19 pandemic—and it is our best way to prevent COVID outbreaks before they happen, so that schools and colleges can return to safe, in-person instruction all year long. To advance the President’s call to action, the Administration will release additional resources that school districts can use to increase vaccination rates among young people, and will continue to partner with communities nationwide to make sure parents and students have their questions answered and have easy access to the vaccine. As part of the launch of the Return to School Roadmap, the Department released: A fact sheet for schools, families, and communities on the Return to School Roadmap, reviewing the three “Landmark” priorities, and elevating schools and districts that are addressing each in effective ways. A guide for schools and districts outlining what schools can do to protect the health and safety of students, including increasing access to vaccinations and steps for implementing the CDC’s recently updated K-12 school guidance. A checklist that parents can use to prepare themselves and their children for a safe return to in-person learning this fall, leading with vaccinating eligible children and masking up if students are not yet vaccinated. As part of the launch of the Roadmap, the White House also released a fact sheet highlighting the Administration’s efforts to safely reopen schools and support our nation’s students, including how the historic investment in the American Rescue Plan is advancing this work. Over the coming weeks, the Department will provide additional resources to schools, districts, and directly to parents and students as part of the Return to School Roadmap. This includes: Working with partners across the federal government to provide support to schools and districts and answer questions about expanding access to vaccinations for students 12+ and implementing CDC’s recently updated K-12 school guidance. Holding town halls with parents and parent organizations to highlight ways schools and districts are preparing to keep students safe during in-person learning and underscoring the importance of providing social, emotional, and mental health supports for students in addition to academic supports in our schools. Releasing implementation tools ;for schools, educators, and parents to address the three priority areas of health and safety; student wellbeing; and academics — in areas ranging from supporting schools in their efforts to address lost instructional and extracurricular time to providing information on how American Rescue Plan funds can be used to expand access to mental health supports for our nation’s students and educators, and provide additional academic supports. Updating Volumes 1 and 2 of the Department of Education’s COVID-19 Handbooks to reflect the recently updated CDC K-12 guidance. Secretary Cardona and other Department officials will be traveling across the country to feature priorities from the Roadmap and highlight schools and communities as they prepare to welcome their students back this fall. The Secretary will also participate in a “Return to School Road Trip” in the fall, visiting schools and districts welcoming students back to in-person learning and successfully implementing the priorities within the Roadmap. The Roadmap is part of the Department’s broader efforts to support schools and districts in the safe and sustained return to in-person learning since the beginning of the Biden Administration. In addition to releasing the Roadmap, the Department has: Issued three volumes of the COVID-19 Handbook to support K-12 schools and institutions of higher education in their reopening efforts. Prioritized the vaccination of educators, school staff and child care workers. Published a Safer Schools and Best Practices Clearinghouse , which includes over 200 examples of schools and communities safely returning to in-person learning. Held a National Safe School Reopening Summit . Provided $122 billion in support through the American Rescue Plan Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund for K-12 schools. Released over $3 billion in IDEA funds within the American Rescue Plan to support children and families with disabilities impacted by the pandemic. Released $800 million within the American Rescue Plan to support students experiencing homelessness who have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. Released a report on the disparate impacts of COVID-19 on underserved students. Launched an ;Equity Summit Series focused on addressing school and district inequities that existed before, but were made worse by the pandemic. Provided nearly $40 billion in funding for institutions of higher education within the American Rescue Plan, about half of which will provide direct aid to students at postsecondary institutions."
29-Jul-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-announces-it-will-expand-second-chance-pell-experiment-2022-2023-award-year,U.S. Department of Education Announces It Will Expand the Second Chance Pell Experiment for the 2022-2023 Award Year,"Today, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) announced it will expand the Second Chance Pell experiment for the 2022-2023 award year. The Second Chance Pell experiment has provided education opportunities for thousands of justice-involved individuals who have previously been unable to access federal need-based financial aid. The expansion will allow up to 200 colleges and universities to offer their prison education programs with support from the Pell Grant program, up from the 131 currently participating. To date, students have earned over 7,000 credentials , building new skills and improving their odds of success. Expansion of the experiment is part of the Department's efforts to expand access and equity in higher education. Providing education in prisons is proven to reduce recidivism rates and is associated with higher employment rates, which will improve public safety and allow individuals to return home to their communities and contribute to society. ""Education plays a crucial role in peoples' ability to prosper and advance,"" said Amy Loyd, Acting Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Career, Technical and Adult Education. ""Too often justice-impacted individuals are left out of the higher-education landscape. With the expansion of the Second Chance Pell experiment, we are taking a crucial step toward the reinstatement of Pell Grant eligibility for incarcerated students. The steps we've taken to include more geographic and program diversity in the experiment will strengthen our understanding of the needs of both the institutions and the students they serve."" The Obama-Biden Administration launched the Second Chance Pell experiment in 2015, providing Pell Grants to incarcerated students in up to 67 programs through postsecondary education programs in state and federal prisons. The program was expanded in 2020 to allow up to 67 additional programs to participate. Since 2015, over 22,000 unique participants have enrolled in a Second Chance Pell Program across 30 states and the Federal Bureau of Prisons. In December 2020, lawmakers expanded access to Pell Grants once again to include students who are incarcerated, as long as they are enrolled in prison education programs that are approved by their state corrections departments or the Federal Bureau of Prisons, and that meet other requirements. This expansion of the Second Chance Pell experiment will allow for opportunities to study the best practices for implementing the reinstatement of Pell Grant eligibility for incarcerated students, and will expand the geographic range of the programs, with the goal of including programs in most, or all fifty states. It will also allow for the inclusion of an even wider variety of postsecondary education programs serving a more diverse population. The Department intends to implement the legislative changes to allow eligible students in college-in-prison programs to access federal Pell Grants beginning on July 1, 2023. The Department has also announced plans to publish regulations on the program prior to its implementation and held public hearings in June of 2021. Institutions interested in applying to participate in the new cohort of Second Chance Pell may submit an application to the Department. Applications will be open from July 30, 2021 for institutions to be accepted for the 2022-23 award year."
29-Jul-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-announces-32-billion-additional-higher-education-emergency-relief-funds-support-students-historic-and-under-resourced-institutions,U.S. Department of Education Announces $3.2 Billion in Additional Higher Education Emergency Relief Funds to Support Students at Historic and Under-Resourced Institutions,"The U.S. Department of Education announced today $3.2 billion in additional emergency grants under the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF). These funds will support students who attend over 1,800 institutions of higher education and provide resources to help these institutions recover from the impacts of the pandemic. Of these funds, $2.97 billion from the American Rescue Plan (ARP) will provide $1.6 billion to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), $143 million to Tribally Controlled Colleges and Universities (TCCUs), and another $1.19 billion to Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs) and under-resourced institutions eligible for the Strengthening Institutions Programs, many of which are community colleges. Additionally, $225 million comes from additional grants from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act and the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act (CRRSAA) to support public and non-profit institutions and their students with the greatest unmet needs related to the pandemic. Today's announcement increases the total amount of funding made available to colleges under the HEERF to more than $76 billion. ""The American Rescue Plan provided critical funds to make sure our nation’s institutions of higher education – particularly those that serve students most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic – receive the resources they need in order to provide students with a high-quality education and the social, emotional and mental health supports to earn their degrees and thrive,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “These institutions have a long history of serving our students—particularly students of color, first-generation college students, and other students who are underrepresented in higher education—and the Department stands ready to support them so they can expand their vital services."" The ARP has made historic investments in many of our nation’s historic or under-resourced institutions that educate students whose communities were most acutely affected by the pandemic. These investments include more than $10 billion to community colleges, more than $2.6 billion to HBCUs, approximately $190 million to TCCUs, and more than $13 billion to MSIs such as Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) and Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institutions (AANAPISIs). ARP resources more than doubled the funding that was previously made available to many of these institutions under the CARES Act and CRRSAA. Today’s announcement provides funding to institutions that are used to doing more with less to enable the development of programs that expand opportunity for all students. These include initiatives aimed at engaging disconnected students, expanding mental health services, and creating more robust retention programs to ensure more students make it to graduation and are prepared to enter our nation’s workforce. It also reflects the Department’s commitment to providing support, resources, and guidance to institutions, students, and communities throughout the pandemic. Additional Funding Awarded Through Supplemental Assistance to Institutions of Higher Education and Institutional Resilience and Expanded Postsecondary Opportunity Grant Programs In addition to the nearly $2.97 billion the Department is announcing under ARP to HBCUs, TCCUs, and MSIs, the Department is announcing an additional distribution of more than $225 million from the CARES Act and CRRSAA to public and non-profit institutions with the greatest unmet needs related to the pandemic through the Supplemental Assistance to Institutions of Higher Education (SAIHE) and Institutional Resilience and Expanded Postsecondary Opportunity (IREPO) Grant Programs. These funds will largely help community colleges which have been hardest hit by the pandemic. This investment will allow such colleges to award additional financial aid to students and fund student support services, such as mental health counseling, retention, and reengagement in postsecondary education. As part of this $225 million in funding, the Department is awarding 110 institutions more than $113 million in additional grants provided under the CRRSAA through the SAIHE grant program. The bulk of these funds - more than $70 million - is awarded to 60 institutions with a high percentage of low-income students, largely community colleges, that experienced a large decline in their fall 2020 enrollment. Additionally, provided under the CARES Act through the IREPO grant program, the Department has awarded 62 institutions or consortiums with the greatest unmet needs related to the pandemic more than $112 million in financial support. These resources will enable institutions to resume or enhance in-person and online operations, implement COVID-19 mitigation strategies, and provide student support services, such as mental-health counseling and affordable course materials. Of the 62 institutions, more than half are community colleges, HBCUs or MSIs, or are rural or serve rural students.

28-Jul-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/department-education-releases-600-million-american-rescue-plan%E2%80%AFfunds-support-students-experiencing-homelessness,Department of Education Releases $600 Million in American Rescue Plan Funds to Support Students Experiencing Homelessness,"The U.S. Department of Education (Department) today released nearly $600 million in funding under the American Rescue Plan Act’s Homeless Children and Youth (ARP-HCY) program to support students experiencing homelessness. In April, the Department released the first $200 million of the $800 million in ARP-HCY funds to states. Following the Department’s approval of state applications today, distribution of all of the remaining funds will give states and school districts access to this critical funding before the beginning of the 2021-2022 school year. “Even before the coronavirus pandemic highlighted and exacerbated inequities in America’s education system, students experiencing homelessness faced numerous challenges as they strove to learn and achieve in school each day. Amid COVID-19 and the transition to remote and hybrid learning, for so many students, these challenges intensified. As a nation, we must do everything we can to ensure that all students—including students experiencing homelessness and housing insecurity—are able to access an excellent education,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “I am thrilled that all states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico now will be able to use these funds from the American Rescue Plan to support students’ success in the new school year and ensure they are connected to vital services and supports.” The additional ARP-HCY funding distributed today will be used by states and school districts to identify children and youth experiencing homelessness. States can provide wraparound services in light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to enable children and youth experiencing homelessness participate fully in school activities, consistent with the McKinney-Vento Act, which is the primary piece of federal legislation related to the education of children and youth experiencing homelessness. Today’s announcement follows the Department’s review and approval of each state’s streamlined application to access the remaining ARP-HCY funds. States may use up to 25 percent of their funds for state-determined uses and, as the result of a rule published by the Department on July 9, states will award at least 75 percent of the state’s funding to school districts through formula subgrants, determined in part by a district’s population of children and youth experiencing homelessness and a district’s Title I-A allocation. Accordingly, districts will not have to compete for these funds, so these funds will reach districts that may not have accessed previous federal funding designated for students experiencing homelessness. This will make it possible for this funding to reach more students experiencing homelessness and for states and districts to access funding more quickly. “Every single student deserves a safe place to call home, but for millions of students experiencing homelessness that is not the case—and during this pandemic these students faced truly unthinkable challenges,” said Sen. Patty Murray. “It’s critical that we identify students experiencing homelessness and get them the resources and support they need to thrive—and that’s exactly what this funding will help do. I’m so proud to have fought to include this critical funding in the American Rescue Plan, and I’m glad to see the Department of Education acting quickly to get these funds to our schools and communities in need. With so many students and families struggling with homelessness, I’ll keep fighting to ensure every single student can succeed in the classroom.” “Every child across America and West Virginia should have a roof over their head every single night,” said Sen. Joe Manchin. “I fought to ensure that the American Rescue Plan included $800 million to help identify and assist students currently experiencing homelessness. Today’s approval of state plans releases the second round of funding. West Virginia alone will be receiving more than $3.7 million, which is good news for the more than 10,000 West Virginia children and youth currently experiencing homelessness. This fight is far from over, and I’ll keep working with the Department of Education to ensure our children get the help they need and deserve.” Each state received the following ARP-HCY allocation, including the amount released today: Total ARP Homeless Allocation ARP Homeless II (75 percent) Total 800,000,000 National Activities 1,000,000 Amount to State Education Agency 799,000,000 599,250,000 ALABAMA 13,239,031 9,930,896 ALASKA 2,350,009 1,762,578 ARIZONA 16,922,395 12,693,864 ARKANSAS 8,213,312 6,160,984 CALIFORNIA 98,757,695 74,080,388 COLORADO 7,643,776 5,733,757 CONNECTICUT 7,247,850 5,436,759 DELAWARE 2,691,098 2,018,466 DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 2,531,300 1,898,654 FLORIDA 46,127,238 34,601,171 GEORGIA 27,849,370 20,890,458 HAWAII 2,701,880 2,026,637 IDAHO 2,882,705 2,162,241 ILLINOIS 33,129,062 24,850,845 INDIANA 13,072,898 9,806,255 IOWA 5,075,905 3,807,531 KANSAS 5,443,402 4,083,208 KENTUCKY 13,281,817 9,867,723 LOUISIANA 17,075,605 12,808,812; MAINE 2,694,822; 2,021,258 MARYLAND 12,787,274 9,592,027 MASSACHUSETTS 11,994,087 8,997,008 MICHIGAN 24,378,753 18,287,030 MINNESOTA 8,655,053 6,492,319 MISSISSIPPI 10,664,254 7,999,500 MISSOURI 12,822,529 9,618,451 MONTANA 2,502,430 1,876,823 NEBRASKA 3,577,701 2,683,703 NEVADA 7,025,680 5,270,140 NEW HAMPSHIRE 2,296,237 1,722,244 NEW JERSEY 18,118,225 13,590,844 NEW MEXICO 6,416,504 4,813,169 NEW YORK 58,910,436 44,190,109 NORTH CAROLINA 23,588,229 17,694,073 NORTH DAKOTA 1,999,979 1,500,064 OHIO 29,308,662 21,985,056 OKLAHOMA 9,788,535 7,342,594 OREGON 7,346,860 5,511,026 PENNSYLVANIA 32,748,656 24,565,479 PUERTO RICO 19,438,068 14,580,948 RHODE ISLAND 2,719,153 2,039,510 SOUTH CAROLINA 13,841,864 10,383,098 SOUTH DAKOTA 2,502,430 1,876,823 TENNESSEE 16,303,363 12,229,524 TEXAS 81,388,454 61,051,359 UTAH 4,033,829 3,025,823 VERMONT 1,868,242 1,401,248 VIRGINIA 13,825,002 10,370,430 WASHINGTON 12,140,633 9,106,915 WEST VIRGINIA 4,990,123 3,743,199 WISCONSIN 10,097,813 7,574,572 WYOMING 1,989,772 1,492,407 States are required to submit plans for their use of ARP-HCY funds within 60 days.

27-Jul-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/statement-us-secretary-education-miguel-cardona-cdc-guidance,Statement from U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona on CDC Guidance,"""Students are provided the best opportunity to learn and thrive when learning in person. We know the best way to safely do this is to get as many people age 12 and older vaccinated. Given the recent trends in COVID spread due to premature relaxation of prevention strategies by unvaccinated individuals and lagging vaccination rates in some parts of our country, we support the recommendation for masking in K-12 schools. We must do everything to ensure that our students do not have to compromise any more of their educational experiences due to increases in community spread. The Department stands ready to work with schools, families, and communities to implement these recommendations from the CDC and ensure all students in every corner of the country can return to school in-person, full time this fall."""
22-Jul-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/department-education-releases-resource-help-schools-improve-ventilation-systems-prevent-covid-19,Department of Education Releases Resource to Help Schools Improve Ventilation Systems to Prevent COVID-19,"Today, the Department of Education released a resource to help schools, colleges, and universities improve their ventilation systems to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and provide healthy learning environments. The resource outlines how American Rescue Plan (ARP) funds can be used to improve indoor air quality and is part of the Department's broader efforts to support schools as they prepare to welcome students back to in-person learning this fall and build back better. The release of the resource coincides with U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona's visit to Kelley Lake Elementary School in Decatur, Georgia, that will use ARP funds to invest in indoor air quality improvements and will be offering in-person learning to all K-12 students for the 2021-2022 school year. ""Protecting our schools and communities from the spread of COVID-19 is the first step in bringing more students back to in-person learning and reemerging from this crisis even stronger than we were before,"" said Secretary Cardona. ""With the American Rescue Plan, schools and districts now have access to unprecedented resources that will enable them to ensure proper ventilation and maintain healthy learning and working environments. At the Department, we are committed to helping communities identify how to use these resources quickly and effectively as they prepare to welcome all students back to in-person learning this fall."" The resource outlines how schools can invest ARP funds, as well as previous rounds of relief funding, to take immediate action to improve indoor air quality, such as the inspection, testing, maintenance, repair, replacement, and upgrading of projects in school facilities. This can include system upgrades, filtering, purification, and other air cleaning fans, and window and door repair. While these investments can provide an important foundation for schools to take action now to improve indoor air quality, more must be done to improve the infrastructure in schools across the country. That's why President Biden has proposed additional resources in his Build Back Better agenda to rebuild our nation's public schools. Visit ed.gov/coronavirus to see how schools can use ARP funds to improve indoor air quality, and learn more about the infrastructure proposals in President Biden's Build Back Better agenda, so that they are safe and healthy places of learning, energy efficient, and have the technology and labs our students need to prepare for jobs in tomorrow's economy.

New Mexico’s plan details how the state is using and plans to use ARP ESSER funds to safely reopen and sustain the safe operation of schools and equitably expand opportunity for students who need it most, particularly those most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Earlier this year, the Department distributed two thirds of the ARP ESSER funds, totaling $81 billion, to 50 states and the District of Columbia. The remaining third of the funding to states will be made available once state plans are approved. New Mexico is receiving more than $979 million total in ARP ESSER funds, and today’s approval of their plan will result in the release of the final $327 million. Additionally, the Department approved plans for Delaware, Georgia, Iowa, and Kansas. Earlier this month, the Department approved the plans for 11 other states and the District of Columbia. “I am excited to announce approval of New Mexico’s plan,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “It is heartening to see, reflected in these state plans, the ways in which states are thinking deeply about how to use American Rescue Plan funds to continue to provide critical support to schools and communities, particularly as we move into the summer and look ahead to the upcoming academic year. The approval of these plans enables states to receive vital, additional American Rescue Plan funds to quickly and safely reopen schools for full-time, in-person learning; meet students’ academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs; and address disparities in access to educational opportunity that were exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. The state plans that have been submitted to the Department lay the groundwork for the ways in which an unprecedented infusion of federal resources will be used to address the urgent needs of America’s children and build back better.” “The state of New Mexico is proud to have the ARP ESSER state plan approved,” said New Mexico Secretary of Public Education Dr. Ryan Stewart. “This plan reflects the input of hundreds of stakeholders throughout the state. The use of these funds will bring relief and opportunity to every student in our state, and will position New Mexico to bounce back strongly from the pandemic. We look forward to the impact these investments will have on students and educators for years to come.” “The pandemic posed a serious challenge to our students, teachers, and schools, and it’s crucial that students, families, and teachers have the resources and support that they need to learn and succeed,” said Sen. Ben Ray Luján. “The American Rescue Plan included robust support for K-12 schools, and I’m glad that the Department of Education approved New Mexico’s plan to respond to students’ needs and ensure that they can safely return to school, accelerate their learning, and address disparities that were exacerbated by the pandemic.” “Faced with an unprecedented pandemic, Congress and the Biden Administration responded with life changing resources for our communities,” said Rep. Teresa Leger Fernandez. “The American Rescue Plan provided the investments needed for our students and teachers to get back into the classrooms. I’m glad to see the Department of Education approve New Mexico’s plan to keep our schools safe and help our most vulnerable students thrive as we come out of this pandemic. These funds will allow our schools to address learning loss and help our students and educators through the social and emotional toll of the pandemic.” The ARP ESSER state plans approved by the Department today, including New Mexico, show how states are using federal pandemic resources to support safe in-person instruction and meet the social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs of students—with a focus on the students most impacted by the pandemic. For example: Addressing the Academic Impact of Lost Instructional Time: The New Mexico Public Education Department (NMPED) will use $22 million in ARP ESSER funds to support strategies to accelerate learning. This includes professional learning on academic acceleration, communities of practice for educators and administrators, developing high-dosage tutoring programs which include evidence-based curriculum and pedagogy, and peer-to-peer tutoring and mentoring. Investing in Summer Learning Programs: NMPED established a joint internship in tribal, county, or municipal governments, between NMPED and local municipalities for students and to reengage at-risk youth for the 2021-22 school year using $6 million in ARP ESSER funding. In addition, NMPED will use $3.8 million in ARP ESSER funding to provide grants to districts and partner organizations to run summer programs in five key areas: 1) STEM programs, 2) outdoor, environmental education programs, 3) museum-based, arts, or cultural programs, 4) at-risk youth and teen-oriented programs, and 5 Investing in Afterschool Programs: NMPED will provide a request for applications to community organizations to provide evidence-based services to students, including expanding Community Schools, which provide extended learning time and wraparound services. These programs will use hands-on learning experiences and encourage discovery and team building. NMPED also will use ARP ESSER funds to provide paid internships for high school students. A total of 41 states and the District of Columbia have submitted their ARP ESSER state plans to the Department. The Department is reviewing the plans expeditiously and is in contact with states to ensure their plans meet all necessary requirements in order to access the remaining funds, as outlined in the ARP. The Department also is in contact with states that have not yet submitted plans, the vast majority of which are due to state board of education or legislative review requirements. The distribution of ARP ESSER funds is part of the Department’s broader effort to support students and districts as they work to reengage students impacted by the pandemic, address inequities exacerbated by COVID-19, and build our education system back better than before.

For example: Addressing the Academic Impact of Lost Instructional Time: The Iowa Department of Education (IDOE) will support school districts to implement evidence-based interventions and practices to be determined that address accelerated learning in the context of COVID-19. The IDOE also will train and provide coaching through a statewide implementation network and provide curated lists of evidence-based interventions and practices from reviewed organizations. Investing in Summer Learning and Expanded Afterschool Programs and Supporting Social, Emotional, and Mental Health Needs: The IDOE will support school districts to select and implement evidence-based interventions and practices that address summer school programming in the context of COVID-19.

Lucy McBath. “Thanks to the hard work of the Biden Administration and my colleagues here in Georgia, this funding will provide vital resources for our schoolchildren, schoolteachers, and school districts. This is more funding to uplift our community, strengthen our schools, and create opportunities for our kids to grow and succeed.” The ARP ESSER state plans approved by the Department today, including Georgia, show how states are using federal pandemic resources to support safe in-person instruction and meet the social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs of students—with a focus on the students most impacted by the pandemic. For example: Addressing the Academic Impact of Lost Instructional Time: The Georgia Department of Education’s (GaDOE) evidence-based interventions will include deploying the state’s Continuous Improvement Teams, designed to support schools by increasing bandwidth, infrastructure, and equipment for students and educators; creating and curating standards-aligned instructional resources and courses; and providing responsive and relevant professional learning. Investing in Summer Learning and Expanded Afterschool Programs: GaDOE will use ARP ESSER funds this summer to provide evidence-based summer learning and enrichment programs and afterschool programs for students across the state. In order to ensure that programming is widely available and of a high caliber that will promote recovery and future academic and development success, the Georgia Statewide Afterschool Network (GSAN) will administer the Building Opportunities in Out-of-School Time (BOOST) grants. The BOOST program will offer three-year grants, renewed annually to community-based organizations that operate comprehensive out-of-school time programming over the summer months, after school during the academic year, or year-round, with the goal of providing evidence-based programming focusing on academic and non-academic barriers for students most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. GaDOE will grant $45 million to organizations with statewide reach and impact that operate year-round programming and would serve at least 2,000 youth annually across at least 15 counties, and $40 million to 100 to 120 community driven organizations operating afterschool and summer learning programs. A total of 41 states and the District of Columbia have submitted their ARP ESSER state plans to the Department. The Department is reviewing the plans expeditiously and is in contact with states to ensure their plans meet all necessary requirements in order to access the remaining funds, as outlined in the ARP. The Department also is in contact with states that have not yet submitted plans, the vast majority of which are due to state board of education or legislative review requirements. The distribution of ARP ESSER funds is part of the Department’s broader effort to support students and districts as they work to reengage students impacted by the pandemic, address inequities exacerbated by COVID-19, and build our education system back better than before. In addition to providing $130 billion for K-12 education in the American Rescue Plan to support the safe reopening of K-12 schools and meet the needs of all students, the Biden-Harris Administration also has: Released three volumes of the COVID-19 Handbook. Held a National Safe School Reopening Summit . Prioritized the vaccination of educators, school staff and child care workers. As of the end of May an estimated 84% of teachers and school staff were fully vaccinated. Provided $10 billion in funding for COVID-19 testing for PreK-12 educators, staff, and students. Launched a series of Equity Summits focused on addressing inequities that existed before, but were made worse by the pandemic. Released a report on the disparate impacts of COVID-19 on underserved communities. Developed a Safer Schools and Campuses Best Practices Clearinghouse elevating hundreds of best practices to support schools’ efforts to reopen safely and address the impacts of COVID-19 on students, educators, and communities. In addition to the actions the Biden Administration has taken to reopen schools, the President has proposed critical investments through his Build Back Better agenda that will enable schools to rebuild stronger than they were before the pandemic, such as investing billions to build a diverse educator workforce, expand access to pre-K to all families, and invest in school infrastructure, among other provisions."

Delaware’s plan details how the state is using and plans to use ARP ESSER funds to safely reopen and sustain the safe operation of schools and equitably expand opportunity for students who need it most, particularly those most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Earlier this year, the Department distributed two thirds of the ARP ESSER funds, totaling $81 billion, to 50 states and the District of Columbia. The remaining third of the funding to states will be made available once state plans are approved. Delaware is receiving more than $410 million total in ARP ESSER funds, and today’s approval of their plan will result in the release of the final $137 million. Additionally, the Department approved plans for Georgia, Iowa, Kansas, and New Mexico. Earlier this month, the Department approved the plans for 11 other states and the District of Columbia. “I am excited to announce approval of Delaware’s plan,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “It is heartening to see, reflected in these state ;plans, the ways in which states are thinking deeply about how to use American Rescue Plan funds to continue to provide critical support to schools and communities, particularly as we move into the summer and look ahead to the upcoming academic year. The approval of these plans enables states to receive vital, additional American Rescue Plan funds to quickly and safely reopen schools for full-time, in-person learning; meet students’ academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs; and address disparities in access to educational opportunity that were exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. The state plans that have been submitted to the Department lay the groundwork for the ways in which an unprecedented infusion of federal resources will be used to address the urgent needs of America’s children and build back better.” “I am grateful for Secretary Cardona’s and his team’s support of Delaware’s plan. Our students and educators are excited to return to school this fall. These funds will help our schools provide the structures and supports to meet students’ academic and social/emotional needs,” Delaware Secretary of Education Susan Bunting said. “As we were working to craft the American Rescue Plan, a top priority was ensuring that our schools, teachers, students, and families had the resources they need to address learning loss and return to school safely,” said U.S. Sen. Tom Carper. “I am hopeful that with these federal funds from the American Rescue Plan, Delaware will be on track to meet the needs of our First State communities, from school leadership to educators to students and their families.” The ARP ESSER state plans approved by the Department today, including Delaware, show how states are using federal pandemic resources to support safe in-person instruction and meet the social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs of students—with a focus on the students most impacted by the pandemic. For example: Addressing the Academic Impact of Lost Instructional Time: The Delaware Department of Education (DDOE) has identified a number of evidence-based interventions for which it may use ARP ESSER funds, which will be refined and finalized after further discussions with DDOE staff, local educational agencies, community organizations, and additional stakeholders. The funds may be used for designating ESSER funds to engage students who have missed the most instruction, providing educators with professional learning to most effectively use data to meet student needs, providing access to student and family supports in families’ home languages, focusing on mental health literacy, and providing additional supports and counseling. Investing in Summer Learning and Expanded Afterschool Programs: DDOE has identified a number of evidence-based interventions for which it may use ARP ESSER funds this summer (2021), which will include high-dosage tutoring, expanding online reading platforms, and expanding access to high-quality instructional materials. Supporting Students’ and Educators’ Social, Emotional, and Mental Health Needs: DDOE will extend its Social, Emotional and Behavioral Wellbeing plan (SEBW) to provide districts and schools with support and resources to identify and provide interventions to students who may be experiencing mental health challenges. The SEBW plan also demonstrates how schools can use current and new support staff alongside strategic system approaches to strengthen social, emotional, and behavioral wellbeing. A total of 41 states and the District of Columbia have submitted their ARP ESSER state plans to the Department. The Department is reviewing the plans expeditiously and is in contact with states to ensure their plans meet all necessary requirements in order to access the remaining funds, as outlined in the ARP.

Sharice Davids. “I’m glad to see the Department of Education approve Kansas’ plan to implement these funds and get our kids back in classrooms safely while also addressing the toll this past year took on our students, educators, and communities.” The ARP ESSER state plans approved by the Department today, including Kansas, show how states are using federal pandemic resources to support safe in-person instruction and meet the social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs of students—with a focus on the students most impacted by the pandemic. For example: Addressing the Academic Impact of Lost Instructional Time: The Kansas Department of Education (KSDE) has identified several evidence-based interventions to mitigate the academic impact of lost instructional time, including focusing on the science of teaching language and literacy skills, standards-based mathematics instruction, social-emotional learning, screening and progress monitoring, and evaluation of learning progress toward achievement of state curricular standards. Investing in Summer Learning and Expanded Afterschool Programs: KSDE will use ARP ESSER funds this summer (2021) to partner with youth-focused community organizations, such as the Boys & Girls Club, 4-H, and YMCA, to help recover lost instructional time in skill development due to the pandemic by using evidence-based summer learning and enrichment programs and afterschool programs. KSDE also plans to offset the cost of admission for students to visit museums, zoos, historical sites, state parks, and the Kansas state fair to promote experiential learning opportunities during the summer. Staffing to Support Students’ and Educators’ Social, Emotional, and Mental Health Needs: ARP ESSER funding will allow KSDE to address a state-wide shortage in licensed professionals trained to address the documented social-emotional needs of students coming out of the pandemic. This will include a Grow Your Own Counselor model that encourages districts to identify candidates and employ them as student services coordinators while they develop their skills in an approved school counseling graduate program.

Markey. ""These resources were made possible by the tireless advocacy of countless students, parents, educators, and administrators in Massachusetts. These critical funds will go a long way in addressing learning loss caused by the public health crisis and helping schools prepare for the 2021 school year."" ""Our students, educators, and communities have overcome unprecedented challenges to keep our kids learning during this crisis,"" said Sen. Elizabeth Warren.

""This funding is critical to supporting and re-engaging students and to accelerating learning,"" said Jeffrey C. Riley, Massachusetts commissioner of elementary and secondary education. ""Districts' careful use of this money can address many student needs that the pandemic exacerbated, including inequities in access to technology and high quality instructional materials."" The ARP ESSER state plans approved by the Department today, including Massachusetts, show how states are using federal pandemic resources to support safe in-person instruction and meet the social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs of students—with a focus on the students most impacted by the pandemic. For example: Returning to In-Person Learning in 2021: The Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) provided specific guidance on requirements related to the reopening and operation of school facilities. In the 2020-2021 school year, elementary schools returned to full-time, in-person learning in the spring. For the 2021-22 school year, all districts and schools will be required to be in-person, full-time, five days a week. Summer programming in 2021 will also operate in-person. Safely Reopening Schools and Sustaining Safe Operations: DESE has collaborated with the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH) to expand opportunities for vaccinations for faculty and students. Their joint effort led to prioritizing educators for vaccines during March and April with specific days set aside solely for them at mass vaccination sites. Most recently, the Department and DPH have launched an effort to provide on campus vaccination clinics for students, faculty, and family members. Such efforts will continue in the months ahead as vaccines become readily available for younger children and the state will encourage the use of American Rescue Plan ESSER funds for these efforts. Accelerating Learning for Students Impacted by the Pandemic: DESE has developed an Acceleration Roadmap designed to provide a focused and phased approach to supporting students as they begin the 2021-22 school year. The state is also considering using ARP ESSER funds for programs like Acceleration Academies, which will create small, hands-on learning environments for Early Literacy and Math. A total of 40 states have submitted their ARP ESSER state plans to the Department. The Department is reviewing the plans expeditiously and is in contact with states to ensure their plans meet all necessary requirements in order to access the remaining funds, as outlined in the ARP.

South Dakota schools also were among the first in the nation to reopen their doors at the start of the 2020-21 school year,” said Secretary of Education Tiffany Sanderson. “Our plan identifies three priorities for the next few years: supporting strong instruction and educational opportunities, addressing students’ mental health needs, and focusing on the educator workforce. As we move forward, we will continue to evaluate data and engage with stakeholders as we identify strategies to support engagement and learning for all students.” The ARP ESSER state plans approved by the Department today, including South Dakota, show how states are using federal pandemic resources to support safe in-person instruction and meet the social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs of students—with a focus on the students most impacted by the pandemic. For example: Returning to In-Person Learning in 2021 Safely Reopening Schools and Sustaining Safe Operations: South Dakota Department of Education (DOE) supported the return to in-person learning in fall 2020 by providing local leaders with the data, resources, and technical assistance they needed to make sound decisions based on the needs of their students, local conditions, and the most up to date science. As most schools have been open the entire previous school year, DOE expects this to continue in school year 2021-22. Hiring School Nurses, Counselors, and Paraprofessionals: In the 2020-21 school year, DOE supported district-led initiatives to add school nurses, counselors and special education paraprofessionals using federal ESSER funding Re-Engaging Students: South Dakota is exploring means to assist LEAs in identifying disengaged students through additional tools and programming to support these students’ academic progress and overall well-being. State level spending of ARP ESSER funds will focus on strategies designed to engage and reengage students that may have missed out on instruction and educational opportunities and provide strong instruction for academic attainment for all students based on their individual needs.

We stand committed to supporting school districts as they develop and implement these new programs. Our goal is to increase student learning, as we strive to lead the nation in student-focused education.” The ARP ESSER state plans approved by the Department today, including Arkansas, show how states are using federal pandemic resources to support safe in-person instruction and meet the social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs of students—with a focus on the students most impacted by the pandemic. For example: Safely Reopening Schools and Sustaining Safe Operations: The state was able to successfully reopen all schools to in-person learning during the 2020-2021 school year by working with the Arkansas Department of Health to establish and implement statewide guidance. Each LEA was required to create its own Ready for Learning plan that focused on the safe return to in-person instruction by outlining the LEA’s health and safety protocols and flexible options for student learning. Investing in Summer Learning and Expanded Afterschool Programs: DESE will partner with Arkansas State University to support its Arkansas out-of-school network using ARP ESSER funds. This network will work to approve programs/activities that can include academic programs, specialty programs, social-emotional support programs, future-ready work opportunities, and multi-purpose programs that provide an array of activities this summer and afterschool. Additionally, the DESE partnered with Arkansas PBS at the end of the 2019-2020 school year and into summer of 2020 to provide grade band content developed by previous Arkansas Teachers of the Year paired with learning guides, and quality programming. This partnership will continue into summer 2021 and is slated to provide educational programs for elementary aged students to help with lost instructional time. These programs include content standards in addition to social, emotional, and mental health material. Arkansas PBS will provide data regarding number of viewers and number of downloads of instructional materials for evaluation of the program. Addressing the Academic Impact of Lost Instructional Time: Using American Rescue Plan funds, DESE created the Arkansas Tutoring Corps, which includes recruitment, preparation, and support for candidates to become qualified tutors to provide instruction or intervention to meet the academic needs of at-risk learners or students most impacted by lost instructional time. A system will connect prepared candidates with organizations seeking support students’ academic needs. The Arkansas Tutoring Corps project will enhance learning experiences of students due to loss of instructional time and address gaps in foundational skills in mathematics and literacy. A total of 40 states have submitted their ARP ESSER state plans to the Department. The Department is reviewing the plans expeditiously and is in contact with states to ensure their plans meet all necessary requirements in order to access the remaining funds, as outlined in the ARP. The Department is also in contact with states that have not yet submitted plans, the vast majority of which are due to state board of education or legislative review requirements. The distribution of ARP ESSER funds is part of the Department’s broader effort to support students and districts as they work to reengage students impacted by the pandemic, address inequities exacerbated by COVID-19, and build our education system back better than before. In addition to providing $130 billion for K-12 education in the American Rescue Plan to support the safe reopening of K-12 schools and meet the needs of all students, the Biden-Harris Administration also has: Released three volumes of the COVID-19 Handbook Held a National Safe School Reopening Summit Prioritized the vaccination of educators, school staff and child care workers.

Rhode Island’s plan details how the state is using and plan to use ARP ESSER funds to safely reopen and sustain the safe operation of schools and equitably expand opportunity for students who need it most, particularly those most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Earlier this year, the Department distributed two thirds of the ARP ESSER funds, totaling $81 billion, to 50 states and the District of Columbia. The remaining third of the funding to states will be made available once state plans are approved. Rhode Island is receiving more than $415 million total in ARP ESSER funds, and today’s approval of their plan will result in the release of the final $138 million. Additionally, the Department approved plans for South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Arkansas, Massachusetts, and the District of Columbia. “I am excited to announce approval of Rhode Island’s plan,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “It is heartening to see, reflected in these state plans, the ways in which states are thinking deeply about how to use American Rescue Plan funds to continue to provide critical support to schools and communities, particularly as we move into the summer and look ahead to the upcoming academic year. The approval of these plans enables states to receive vital, additional American Rescue Plan funds to quickly and safely reopen schools for full-time, in-person learning; meet students’ academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs; and address disparities in access to educational opportunity that were exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. The state plans that have been submitted to the Department lay the groundwork for the ways in which an unprecedented infusion of federal resources will be used to address the urgent needs of America’s children and build back better.” “In Rhode Island, we convened the Learning, Equity & Accelerated Pathways (LEAP) Task Force to build a framework to help students not just recover from the learning disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic, but to leap ahead to academic success,” said Rhode Island Education Commissioner Angélica Infante-Green. “Our goal is not remediation but rather acceleration in education with a focus on ensuring equity across the board. With input from the communities we serve, leading education experts, and many other stakeholders, we built a roadmap for strategic, sustainable and impactful state-wide ESSER investments that will help us get students back to in-person learning, improve attendance, promote academic achievement and address existing inequities laid bare by the pandemic. With approval of Rhode Island’s American Rescue Plan Act ESSER plan, we are on track to make once-in-a-generation investments that will help us ensure every student has access to high-quality learning experiences.” “Our teachers and administrators did inspiring work to keep students on track during the pandemic,” said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse. “This award will help schools continue to tackle the complicated challenges of making sure students, teachers, and staff are safe and productive. The delegation fought hard to secure this federal funding in the American Rescue Plan, and I’m pleased to see it go to Rhode Island schools.” The ARP ESSER state plans approved by the Department today, including Rhode Island, show how states are using federal pandemic resources to support safe in-person instruction and meet the social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs of students—with a focus on the students most impacted by the pandemic. For example: Returning to In-Person Learning in 2021: Rhode Island was able to reopen schools at full capacity based on CDC guidance the past year, achieved through continued collaboration, robust testing, layered mitigation, and flexibility from school leaders, teachers, students, and families. All Local Education Agencies (LEAs) will be expected to provide full in-person learning for all students during summer 2021 and for the 2021-2022 school year. Safely Reopening Schools and Sustaining Safe Operations: The Rhode Island Department of Education (RIDE) worked directly with the Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) and local municipalities to establish vaccine clinics for all educational staff and eligible students. Student vaccine clinics were held in schools during the 2020-2021 school year and Rhode Island expects these to continue this summer and fall. Supporting Students Most Impacted by the Pandemic: RIDE expects all LEAs to ensure equity is the guiding lens for assessing local data and identifying the most pressing student needs. RIDE has allocated a portion of its state set-aside dollars from the American Rescue Plan to support the lowest performing schools and LEAs. Staffing to Support Students’ Mental Health Needs: RIDE has encouraged allocation of ARP funds towards human capital and staffing, particularly focused on expanding capacity to support students’ social-emotional wellness, including additional social workers or guidance counselors, or partnerships with community mental health providers. A total of 40 states have submitted their ARP ESSER state plans to the Department. The Department is reviewing the plans expeditiously and is in contact with states to ensure their plans meet all necessary requirements in order to access the remaining funds, as outlined in the ARP.

The ARP ESSER state plans approved by the Department today, including Utah, show how states are using Federal pandemic resources to support safe in-person instruction and meet the social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs of students—with a focus on the students most impacted by the pandemic. For example: Returning to In-Person Learning in 2021: The Utah State Board of Education (USBE) worked collaboratively with the Utah Department of Health, the Governor's office, and others to establish health and safety protocols that supported most Utah students continuing with in-person learning throughout the 2020-2021 school year. Assessing the Impact of Lost Instructional Time: USBE developed a comprehensive plan for determining the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on student learning, including the identification of relevant data sources and the addition of opportunity to learn questions on statewide summative assessments in grades 3-10. USBE also administered a school climate survey to all LEAs in spring 2021 to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on each student subgroup. USBE is also actively collecting school level data on lost instructional time. USBE will use data from these sources to identify additional highest priority needs and identify any subgroups of students which have been most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Investing in Summer Learning and Afterschool Programs: USBE indicates that it will award ARP ESSER funds for evidence-based summer learning and evidence-based afterschool programming through a competitive grant process to both LEAs and community-based organizations (CBOs). In the application, the LEA must include a description of the evidence-based interventions that it will implement. Applicants will not only be required to support student's academic needs, but also students' social, emotional, and mental health needs to be awarded the ARP funds. Applicants will also be required to submit targeted plans to serve students most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and applications will be reviewed by subject matter experts.

""Through our state plan, we prioritize a safe reopening when we welcome students and staff to our schools in the fall, focus on student and staff well-being, and promote accelerated learning to give our students the best opportunity to recover and move forward with a successful school year."" The ARP ESSER state plans approved by the Department today, including the District of Columbia, show how states are using federal pandemic resources to support safe in-person instruction and meet the social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs of students—with a focus on the students most impacted by the pandemic. For example: Returning to In-Person Learning in 2021 and Safely Reopening Schools and Sustaining Safe Operations: DC plans to serve all students in person, five days per week, in fall 2021. To address the challenges of returning to in-person instruction and to ensure a safe reopening, the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) is requiring local educational agencies (LEAs) to develop detailed health and safety plans that outline how each LEA will safely reopen in a way that aligns with guidance from the CDC, DC Department of Health, and OSSE. Staffing to Support Students' Social, Emotional, and Mental Health Needs: The District of Columbia is expanding its Comprehensive School Based Behavioral Health System to expand access to clinical services in public schools across the District of Columbia. This support is to ensure schools are fully staffed with behavioral health providers to deliver multi-tiered behavioral health systems and supports that are essential to the well-being of students and help prevent more complex, lifelong behavioral health challenges. Behavioral health clinicians (social workers and professional counselors) assigned full-time to schools provide prevention and mental health promotion activities to the whole school community and deliver early intervention and clinical services to assigned students. OSSE is also encouraging and supporting LEAs to plan for how district-level ESSER allocations may be used to support staffing their schools and training their teams to meet students' mental and physical health needs. Investing in Summer Learning and Expanding Afterschool Programs: OSSE will expand Out of School Time grants using ARP ESSER funds in 2020-21, which will be awarded to 501(c)3 organizations that provide summer learning and afterschool programs, and have experience implementing evidence-based interventions. OSSE will collect participant level data from grantees and will evaluate academic performance of participants, including in-school attendance, afterschool attendance, and assessment data. All grantees that serve grades four or higher will be required to administer the Survey of Academic and Youth Outcomes to measure social and emotional learning.

This model will span the next three years and will provide tutor training and certification, grade-level specific content, high-dosage tutoring, significant guidance and tutoring resources, and a directory of TDOE-reviewed providers. TDOE will offer districts the opportunity to apply for matching grants to fund TN ALL Corps, as well as offer matching grants for community partners to help provide academic acceleration supports for students. TDOE also will continue to invest in reading and early literacy through its statewide Reading360 initiative, launched earlier this year, directing a suite of supports and resources to boost third-grade reading proficiency. Investing in Summer Learning and Expanded Afterschool Programs: Ensuring students and families had opportunities to extend learning beyond classrooms, TDOE developed at-home learning resources and materials in partnerships with the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and the Tennessee STEM Innovation Network (TSIN) that continue today, and recently made available free Reading360 decodable readers for families with young children to focus on strengthening early reading skills. To support new statewide summer programming and tutoring supports for students, TDOE will provide resources for instruction in summer learning camps as well as district and community partner grants to support high dosage tutoring models.

West Virginia's plan details how the state is using and plans to use ARP ESSER funds to safely reopen and sustain the safe operation of schools and equitably expand opportunity for students who need it most, particularly those most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Earlier this year, the Department distributed two thirds of the ARP ESSER funds, totaling $81 billion, to 50 states and the District of Columbia. The remaining third of the funding to states will be made available once state plans are approved. West Virginia is receiving more than $761 million total in ARP ESSER funds, and today's approval of their plan will result in the release of the final $254 million. Additionally, the Department approved plans for Oregon, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Ohio. Last week, the Department approved the plans for six states and the District of Columbia. ""I am excited to announce approval of West Virginia's plan,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""It is heartening to see, reflected in these state plans, the ways in which states are thinking deeply about how to use American Rescue Plan funds to continue to provide critical support to schools and communities, particularly as we move into the summer and look ahead to the upcoming academic year. The approval of these plans enables states to receive vital, additional American Rescue Plan funds to quickly and safely reopen schools for full-time, in-person learning; meet students' academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs; and address disparities in access to educational opportunity that were exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. The state plans that have been submitted to the Department lay the groundwork for the ways in which an unprecedented infusion of federal resources will be used to address the urgent needs of America's children and build back better."" ""West Virginia's students will benefit greatly from the ARP ESSER funds,"" said State Superintendent of Schools Clayton Burch. ""Specifically, we are focused on making sure that students and staff have the supports they need to 1) recover from the social and emotional distress caused or heightened by the pandemic and 2) regain learning momentum that was negatively impacted by disruptions to in-person learning."" ""After the last year of the COVID-19 pandemic and unprecedented changes, West Virginia students deserve to return to safe, supportive schools in the fall,"" said Sen. Joe Manchin. ""The American Rescue Plan provides West Virginia schools with more than $760 million to safely open our schools and help our students catch up after the last year. I am pleased the Department of Education has approved West Virginia's plan for these funds and look forward to seeing the positive impacts for our students."" The ARP ESSER state plans approved by the Department today, including West Virginia, show how states are using federal pandemic resources to support safe in-person instruction and meet the social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs of students—with a focus on the students most impacted by the pandemic. For example: Safely Reopening Schools and Sustaining Safe Operations: In preparation of the 2020-2021 school year, the West Virginia Department of Education (WVDE) developed a Roadmap-to-Recovery that outlines the rules under which schools operate during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Roadmap document has been updated regularly and is available for public comment now. West Virginia began a campaign encouraging high school students to get vaccinated in April 2021, which included hosting student vaccination clinics and engaging students and families on social media and will continue into the fall of 2021. Addressing the Academic Impact of Lost Instructional Time: Districts in West Virginia will implement evidence-based interventions to address the impact of lost instructional time on students, including meeting the needs of students disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. WVDE also will support its districts by expanding state Technical Assistance Centers (TACs), which will support these interventions through professional development programs. WVDE will bolster three existing TACs by establishing two additional TACs using ARP ESSER funds, which will focus on grades 6-12 STEM and student support and wellbeing. A total of 40 states have submitted their ARP ESSER state plans to the Department. The Department is reviewing the plans expeditiously and is in contact with states to ensure their plans meet all necessary requirements in order to access the remaining funds, as outlined in the ARP. The Department also is in contact with states that have not yet submitted plans, the vast majority of which are due to state board of education or legislative review requirements.

""Oregon's ESSER state plan provides opportunities to deepen partnerships while addressing the challenges brought on by COVID-19, poverty, systemic racism, wildfires, loss of power, and the hundreds of ways we struggle to respond to the wholeness of students, families, educators, and school leaders,"" said Carmen Xiomara Urbina, deputy director of Oregon Department of Education. ""Thank you to President Biden and Congress for allocating these resources for our schools and Secretary Cardona and the U.S. Department of Education team for their hard work going through all the state plans. The historic investment in education from Oregon lawmakers in the form of the Student Success Act led schools and school districts to engage with students, families, and communities in new ways and the ESSER state plan leverages this model to ensure communities are involved in determining the best use of these federal funds. The resilience and strength of Oregon's communities and schools are remarkable, and this funding is a significant step on the road to recovery."" ""Oregon families and educators have their eyes set on the safe reopening of schools this fall. Our students deserve significant investment to address the learning losses as well as the social and emotional toll they endured in the past year and half due to the pandemic,"" Sen. Ron Wyden said. ""After fighting to make sure Oregon gets the resources to recover with the passage of the American Rescue Plan, I am heartened to see the Department of Education approve my home state's plan. Oregon's schools will see more than $1 billion in federal investment for the success of our state's youngsters after an extremely difficult and unprecedented period."" ""I am pleased the Department of Education approved Oregon's plan to use the emergency relief funds the state was awarded through the American Rescue Plan so we can get our elementary and secondary education system back on track in the wake of the pandemic,"" Rep. Kurt Schrader said. ""The unprecedented disruption to the traditional ways of learning took a significant social and emotional toll on our students, families and staff. Our communities of color and students with disabilities were especially impacted, as existing inequities in educational opportunities were further worsened with virtual learning. Now as we get closer to the start of a new school year, these resources will prove invaluable to Oregon schools as they work to address these deep issues and welcome students back in the classroom this fall."" ""Our schools are important to families, communities, and the economy,"" said Rep. Suzanne Bonamici. ""It's critical that students and educators have the support they need to recover from the pandemic and build a better future. I worked hard in Congress to get robust funding for our education systems, and I'm grateful that the Department of Education has approved Oregon's plan to use resources from the American Rescue Plan. These funds will help address unfinished learning, make sure our schools are safe for all to thrive, close the digital divide, and more."" The ARP ESSER state plans approved by the Department today, including Oregon, show how states are using federal pandemic resources to support safe in-person instruction and meet the social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs of students—with a focus on the students most impacted by the pandemic. For example: Safely Reopening Schools and Sustaining Safe Operations: Returning to in-person instruction and the safe operation of school facilities are Oregon's highest priorities. To support schools with safe operations and returning to in-person instruction in the 2020-21 school year, the Oregon Department of Education (ODE) partnered with the Oregon Health Authority and used CDC guidance to develop the Ready Schools Safe Learners (RSSL) Guidance. This guidance included both requirements and recommendations on health and safety protocols. The health and safety aspects of RSSL applied to all Oregon districts, public charter schools, and private schools, and was updated regularly throughout the pandemic as Executive Orders from the Governor and guidance from the CDC changed. In addition, ODE created supplementary supports, aligned with the RSSL, to communicate, respond to, and understand the on-the-ground needs of its schools. ODE will continue to provide guidance, technical assistance, and professional development to support the return to in-person instruction. Addressing the Academic Impact of Lost Instructional Time: ODE will select evidence-based interventions to support accelerated learning to expand opportunities to students currently and historically underserved by the education system. This will include the selection of evidence-based intervention to support Career, College and Community Readiness by working with districts and other educational partners to reengage high school students who have been disconnected from their schools or communities as a result of COVID-19. ODE also will design tools and resources for teaching and learning, such as formative assessment practices; professional learning opportunities for educators on learning acceleration, culturally affirming and sustaining pedagogy, and technology-enabled instruction; and culturally responsive instructional materials. Investing in Summer Learning and Expanded Afterschool Programs: ODE will develop a process to grant districts and educational entities funds to identify, create, and employ effective summer programming outreach strategies to recruit and retain students who missed the most in-person instruction and students who did not consistently participate in remote instruction during the 2020-21 school year. ODE also will establish a process with ARP ESSER funds to create high-quality out-of-school programs through the application of evidence-based practice to address unfinished learning and increase opportunities that elevate relationships, enrichment, and well-rounded learning that matters to students. A total of 40 states have submitted their ARP ESSER state plans to the Department. The Department is reviewing the plans expeditiously and is in contact with states to ensure their plans meet all necessary requirements in order to access the remaining funds, as outlined in the ARP.

""We are proud of our work toward recovery, and we are grateful to the USDE for their swift approval of our plan."" The ARP ESSER state plans approved by the Department today, including Oklahoma, show how states are using federal pandemic resources to support safe in-person instruction and meet the social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs of students—with a focus on the students most impacted by the pandemic. For example: Addressing the Academic Impact of Lost Instructional Time: OSDE will partner with Oklahoma college and universities to invest ARP ESSER funds in a Math Tutoring Corps to help address middle and high school learning disruptions due to the pandemic. OSDE is also investing in science and math professional development opportunities for educators. Additionally, it will invest in paid student teaching and first-year teacher induction programs. >All interventions will have evaluative measures applied through internal processes, collaboration with education partners, or contractual arrangements with external evaluators. Investing in Summer Learning and Expanded Afterschool Programs: OSDE intends to invest ARP ESSER funds to implement evidence-based summer learning and enrichment programs and to expand afterschool programming through partnerships with the YMCA and Boys & Girls Clubs. These programs will target the most at-risk youth. They will provide supports for academic recovery, social and emotional support, and access to technology. OSDE will provide competitive grant opportunities for funding to begin or enhance summer school programs, giving priority points to those applicants that will serve the most underserved populations and those that had their learning most disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic. These opportunities will supplement the 102 existing 21st Century Community Learning Centers in the state to provide afterschool programming. Staffing to Support Students' Needs: OSDE will use ARP ESSER funding to hire new school counselors, mental health professionals, and recreational therapists due to an identified shortage in the state. OSDE has awarded grants for 222 school counselors, 94 licensed mental health professionals, and 42 contracts for services. OSDE has launched a School Counselor Corps grant to allow districts to apply for funding to increase the number of school counselors, licensed mental health professionals, licensed recreational therapists and/or mental health contract services. Additional school counselors and school-based mental health professionals may also assist with student needs caused by the high incidence of childhood trauma in Oklahoma and the impact of the pandemic on students. Additionally, OSDE will employ five student support specialists to provide training, technical assistance, and coaching to all counselors hired under this initiative and any other counselors wishing to attend. Trainings will be provided to these new employees in order to best meet the academic, college and career, and social and emotional needs of students. OSDE will also launch new Social & Emotional Learning Competencies (PK-grade 12 and adult) in summer 2021. These competencies are based on the Collaborative for Academic, Social & Emotional Learning (CASEL) five evidence-based competencies: self-awareness, self-management, responsible decision-making, relationship skills, and social awareness. A total of 40 states have submitted their ARP ESSER state plans to the Department. The Department is reviewing the plans expeditiously and is in contact with states to ensure their plans meet all necessary requirements in order to access the remaining funds, as outlined in the ARP.

These Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) are intended to inform state and local efforts in effectively using American Rescue Plan Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ARP ESSER) funds to support evidence-based, full-service community schools and related approaches. ""When schools are at the center of our neighborhoods and communities, children and families benefit. I hope that the resource we are releasing today will help states and school districts use American Rescue Plan funds to increase access to evidence-based community schools for more students and families across the country,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""Community schools serve as hubs for vital resources and connect students and families to services that can help them thrive. Importantly, community schools expand learning and enrichment opportunities for both students and parents alike, and promote family and community engagement in education, which ultimately can bolster students' success. That's why I'm proud the President's Build Back Better agenda robustly supports community schools with an additional investment of $443 million in his budget request for education."" The Department is releasing the FAQs to provide districts and communities with information and considerations for expanding existing full-service community schools and implementing this approach in additional schools. All of the strategies described in the FAQs can be supported by funding under the American Rescue Plan, regardless of whether a school is a full-service community school. A full-service community school is a public elementary or secondary school that uses established partnerships between schools, families, and community organizations to provide well-rounded educational opportunities and meet the social, emotional, physical, mental health, and academic needs of students. Full-service community school approaches can leverage community resources to bring needed support for students and families into public schools, such as after-school programs, health and social services, and other comprehensive services. Full-service community schools can be a useful strategy to help ensure that a child's opportunities are not limited by zip code, family's income, race/ethnicity, disability status, or other factors. Research shows that evidence-based approaches to community schools can improve student social, emotional, and academic outcomes. In March, the Department announced the allocation that each state educational agency (SEA) will receive under the ARP ESSER Fund, totaling $122 billion in relief for K-12 schools. One of the important allowable uses of ARP ESSER funds specified in the statute is to support full-service community schools. The Department currently offers competitive & grants for full-service community schools to improve coordination, integration, accessibility, and effectiveness of services for children and families. ARP ESSER funds may be used to replicate, expand, and scale-up these efforts. In addition, because community schools have built-in services and structures that will help students return to in-person learning, the Department is requesting a significant increase in funding for the program ($443 million) in its Fiscal Year 2022 budget request in alignment with President Biden's Build Back Better agenda. Secretary Cardona embarked this week on a cross-country tour to visit schools and community colleges preparing for full reopening this fall, with the assistance of the American Rescue Plan. The Department will continue to provide support and resources to schools and communities as they work to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic and rebuild our education system back better than it was pre-pandemic."
13-Jul-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-announces-temporary-changes-federal-aid-verification-process-2021-22-award-year,U.S. Department of Education Announces Temporary Changes to the Federal Aid Verification Process for the 2021-22 Award Year,"Today, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) announced temporary changes to the federal student aid verification process for the 2021–22 award year. The temporary changes will provide relief to millions of students and colleges facing challenges as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Department will focus aid verification on identity theft and fraud for the 2021–22 application cycle, significantly reducing other barriers that have prevented students most in need, from accessing critical financial aid funds. Today's action is part of the Department's broader efforts to provide relief to students and borrowers impacted by the pandemic, and address inequities made worse by COVID-19. While the challenges students experience with verification extend beyond the pandemic, data from the National Student Clearinghouse show college undergraduate enrollment rates fell 4.9 percent in Spring 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 emergency. For students of color and students from low-income backgrounds, those declines were even steeper. These enrollment declines have also been sharpest at community colleges, which saw a 9.5 percent decrease in enrollment and are already significantly resource-constrained due to the economic impacts of the pandemic. Department research shows that targeting verification this aid cycle, can help approximately 200,000 more students from low-income backgrounds and students of color enroll in college and continue on the path to a degree. ""This has been an exceptionally tough year,"" said Richard Cordray, Chief Operating Officer of Federal Student Aid (FSA). ""We need to ensure students have the most straightforward path to acquiring the financial aid they need to enroll in college and continue their path to a degree. Targeting verification to focus on identity theft and fraud this aid cycle, ensures we address immediate student needs, continue to protect the integrity of the Federal Pell Grant Program, and reduce barriers to access for underserved students. We will continue to evaluate what improvements can be done longer-term to make the verification process more equitable while still preventing fraud."" Verification is an administrative process by which the Department requires a subset of federal student aid applicants who are eligible for Pell Grants to submit additional documentation, such as transcripts of tax returns, to verify their income and other information reported on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form. Non-Pell-eligible applicants are not selected for income verification. As a result, the verification process disproportionately burdens students from low-income backgrounds and students of color. The process can be extremely challenging for students, particularly because at least 20 percent of Pell-eligible applicants are exempt from tax filing due to their low-income levels. This prevents them from using the automated Data Retrieval Tool to easily import verified income data from the IRS onto their FAFSA form, and can impose difficulties in acquiring the necessary documentation to prove their income. Typically, more than three million potential Pell Grant recipients are selected for verification each year. Unfortunately, due to the challenges they face in acquiring the required documentation, some students never complete verification, and thus do not receive the financial aid they need to enroll. Targeting verification for the 2021–22 FAFSA cycle will make it easier for millions of students from low-income backgrounds to access federal financial aid. It will also alleviate some of the burden faced by financial aid administrators, allowing them to focus their time and resources on administering emergency relief funds, getting students into and through higher education, including by updating FAFSA information for students who have lost their jobs due to the pandemic, and by helping students learn about and access emergency financial aid grants provided under the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund. This temporary verification process accompanies the many tools and oversight measures the Department uses to monitor suspicious activity, mitigate fraud, and identify over- and under-awards of Pell Grant funds. Current tools and oversight measures include the following: FSA works with the Department's Office of Inspector General (OIG) to constantly monitor for fraudulent activity among groups of FAFSA filers. FSA conducts compliance reviews of colleges and universities. These compliance reviews ensure that fraud is not occurring at the campus level and that improper payments are not being made. FSA's Ombudsman receives complaints of cases of potential fraud through the Feedback Center. Such reports of suspicious activity are further examined by FSA and the OIG. FSA encourages the use of the IRS Data Retrieval Tool that FAFSA filers can use to automatically import their tax data directly into the FAFSA form. About 52 percent of filers use this tool, which eliminates the need to further verify their income. Today's announcement builds upon the Biden Administration's commitment to addressing inequities exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and targeting resources and relief efforts toward the colleges and communities that need it most. Under the American Rescue Plan, the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act, and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, the Department has provided $76 billion in economic relief for students and colleges impacted by the pandemic."

9-Jul-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/department-education-approves-borrower-defense-claims-related-three-additional-institutions,Department of Education Approves Borrower Defense Claims Related to Three Additional Institutions,"The U.S. Department of Education (Department) announced today the approval of over 1,800 borrower defense to repayment (borrower defense) claims for borrowers who attended three institutions: Westwood College, Marinello Schools of Beauty and the Court Reporting Institute. This is the first time the Department has announced approved borrower defense claims for students who attended institutions besides Corinthian Colleges, ITT Technical Institute, and American Career Institute since 2017. These borrowers will receive 100 percent loan discharges, resulting in approximately $55.6 million in relief. This brings total loan cancellation based on borrower defense by the Biden Administration to over $1.5 billion for nearly 92,000 borrowers. ""Today’s announcement continues the U.S. Department of Education’s commitment to standing up for students whose colleges took advantage of them,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “The Department will continue doing its part to review and approve borrower defense claims quickly and fairly so that borrowers receive the relief that they need and deserve. We also hope these approvals serve as a warning to any institution engaging in similar conduct that this type of misrepresentation is unacceptable."" Westwood College The Department is approving two types of claims related to Westwood College (Westwood). First, the Department found that, from 2002 through its 2015 closure, all of Westwood’s campuses across the country engaged in widespread misrepresentations about the ability of students to transfer credits. Despite claims by Westwood, students were generally unable to transfer their credits to other institutions. The inability of Westwood students to transfer their credits meant that they had to—or would have to—restart their education at a different school. Second, the Department found that, from 2004 until its closure in 2015, Westwood made widespread, substantial misrepresentations to students that its criminal justice program would lead to careers as police officers in Illinois, particularly in the Chicago area. The institution told students they would be able to find employment with the Chicago Police Department and other law enforcement agencies when, in fact, these agencies would not accept Westwood credits in their hiring processes. Borrowers said that instead of obtaining employment as a police officer after graduation from Westwood, they often had to accept minimum wage jobs or jobs that required no degree at all. The result was that students were worse off after attending Westwood. The Department has approved over 1,600 claims, representing approximately $53 million in relief for former Westwood students. Westwood College was owned by Alta College, Inc. (Alta), which was located in Colorado. Major executives at Alta included co-founder Kirk Riedinger and George Burnett. In 2002, Alta was acquired by Housatonic Partners, a private equity firm located in California and Massachusetts. Marinello Schools of Beauty The Department found that Marinello Schools of Beauty (Marinello) made widespread, substantial misrepresentations about the instruction that would be offered at its campuses across the country. These misrepresentations occurred from 2009 until the schools closed in 2016 after the Department denied Marinello’s application for continued participation in federal student aid programs. Borrowers regularly asserted that the schools failed to train them about key elements of a cosmetology program, such as how to cut hair. The Department found that Marinello left students without instructors for weeks or months at a time as part of a pattern of failing to provide the education it promised. As a result, students found it extremely difficult to pass necessary state licensing tests and receive any return on their educational investment. As of today, the Department has approved over 200 claims, representing approximately $2.2 million in relief for former Marinello students. At all times relevant to the findings, Marinello was owned by B&H Education Inc. (B&H), which was a Delaware corporation. The leaders of B&H included Rashad Elyas, Nagui Elyas, Mike Benvenuti, and Michael Flecker in 2013 when it was sued under the False Claims Act in a lawsuit that resulted in an $8.6 million settlement in 2016. Court Reporting Institute The Department found that from 1998 through its 2006 closure, the Court Reporting Institute (CRI) made widespread, substantial misrepresentations about the time it would take to complete its court reporting program. The majority of CRI students were never able to complete the court reporting program and, therefore, could not become court reporters. In fact, data reviewed by the Department showed that just two to six percent of students graduated and those who did finish the program took much longer to do so than the institution claimed. These findings cover each of the institution’s locations, which were in Washington, California, and Idaho. As of today, the Department has approved 18 claims, representing approximately $340,000 in relief for former CRI students. During the findings period and at the time of its closure, CRI was owned by Alen Janisch. The findings regarding Westwood and CRI were made possible by evidence provided by law enforcement partners at the offices of the Washington, Colorado, and Illinois attorneys general. The Department will continue working with these law enforcement partners and others to identify institutional misconduct that harms federal student loan borrowers. Today’s action continues efforts by the Biden Administration to ensure borrower defense and other targeted loan cancellation, forgiveness, and discharge programs deliver relief to students and borrowers. In March, the agency announced that it would grant $1 billion in relief to 72,000 borrowers with approved borrower defense claims related to Corinthian Colleges and ITT Technical Institute (ITT). Subsequently, the Department announced an additional $500 million in relief for 18,000 borrowers with approved borrower defense claims related to ITT. The Department also suspended requests for earnings documentation from borrowers who had received a total and permanent disability discharge; this action reinstated discharges for 41,000 borrowers and will help protect another 190,000 borrowers from the risk of losing their discharges for this reason. The Department is considering a future rulemaking on borrower defense and held public hearings to receive stakeholder feedback in late June.

The state plans detail how states are using and plan to use ARP ESSER funds to safely reopen and sustain the safe operation of schools, and address the needs of students, including by equitably expanding opportunity for students disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Earlier this year, the Department distributed two thirds of the ARP ESSER funds, totaling $81 billion, to 50 states and the District of Columbia. The remaining third of the funding to states is being made available once their plans are approved. Today's approval of state plans for South Dakota, Texas, Massachusetts, Utah, Arkansas, Rhode Island, and Washington D.C., will result in the release of nearly $6 billion in ARP ESSER funds for these six states and Washington D.C., following the $12 billion in ARP ESSER funds distributed to these states earlier this year. ""It is heartening to see, reflected in these state plans, the ways in which states and Washington, D.C., are planning to use American Rescue Plan funds to continue to provide critical support to schools and communities, particularly as we move into the summer and look ahead to the upcoming academic year,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""The approval of these plans enables states to receive vital, additional American Rescue Plan funds to quickly and safely reopen schools for full-time, in-person learning; meet students' academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs; and address disparities in access to educational opportunity that were exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. From investing in summer learning and enrichment programs, to expanding access to COVID-19 vaccinations for school staff and students, to addressing the academic impacts of unfinished instructional time and increasing students' access to school counselors and mental health services, the state plans that have been submitted to the Department lay the groundwork for the ways in which an unprecedented infusion of federal resources will be used to address the urgent needs of America's children and build back better."" Highlights of how states plan to use ARP ESSER funds include: Arkansas has developed an Arkansas Tutoring Corps that will create a system to recruit, prepare, and support candidates to become qualified tutors who provide instruction or intervention for students to meet academic needs of at-risk learners, or students most impacted by lost instructional time. The Arkansas Tutoring Corps project will enhance learning experiences of students due to loss of instructional time and address gaps in foundational skills in mathematics and literacy using ARP ESSER funds. Washington, D.C.'s Out of School Time grants, funded by ARP ESSER funds, will enable community-based organizations to provide summer learning programs to students, designed to improve academic performance through evidence-based interventions. Texas plans to use ARP ESSER funds to address the academic impact of lost instructional time for Texas students, and plans to offer high-dosage tutoring, high-quality instructional materials, and job-embedded professional learning to help address the academic impact of lost instructional time. In South Dakota, the state education agency will use ARP ESSER funding to focus on strategies designed to engage and re-engage students that may have missed out on instruction and educational opportunities over the last year. With a portion of ARP ESSER funds, Massachusetts will help schools fund Acceleration Academies this summer (2021), which will allow students to learn and build skills working intensively on one subject in small, hands-on learning environments with excellent teachers. This will be a multi-year program that the Department anticipates will impact more than 50,000 students statewide each year. Utah will award ARP ESSER funds for evidence-based summer learning and afterschool programming through a competitive grant process to both districts and community-based organizations which will support students' academic and social, emotional, and mental health needs. Rhode Island will significantly expand summer learning options statewide through its All-Course Network platform, which provides free instruction to students on topics ranging from AP classes to animation courses. The following remaining ARP ESSER funds will be distributed today to the seven states and territories with the approval of the state plans: Massachusetts: $611,331,608 Rhode Island: $138,468,766 Texas: $4,148,464,081 South Dakota: $127,339,745 Utah: $205,578,303 Washington, D.C.: $128,932,230 Arkansas: $418,634,738 A total of 40 states have submitted their ARP ESSER state plans to the Department. The Department is reviewing the plans expeditiously and is in contact with states to ensure their plans meet all necessary requirements in order to access the remaining funds, as outlined in the ARP. The Department is also in contact with states that have not yet submitted plans, the vast majority of which are due to state board of education or legislative review requirements. Distribution of ARP ESSER funds is part of the Department's broader effort to support students and districts as they work to reengage students impacted by the pandemic, address inequities exacerbated by COVID-19, and build our education system back better than before. In addition to providing $130 billion for K-12 education in the American Rescue Plan to support the safe reopening of K-12 schools and meet the needs of all students, the Biden-Harris Administration also has: Released three volumes of the COVID-19 Handbook.. Held a National Safe School Reopening Summit . Prioritized the vaccination of educators, school staff, and childcare workers. As of the end of May, an estimated 84% of teachers and school staff were fully vaccinated. Provided $10 billion in funding for COVID-19 testing for PreK-12 educators, staff, and students. Launched a series of Equity Summits focused on addressing inequities that existed before but were made worse by the pandemic. Released a report on the disparate impacts of COVID-19 on underserved communities. Developed a Safer Schools and Campuses Best Practices Clearinghouse elevating hundreds of best practices to support schools' efforts to reopen safely and address the impacts of COVID-19 on students, educators, and communities. In addition to the actions the Biden Administration has taken to reopen schools, the President has proposed critical investments through his Build Back Better Agenda that will enable schools to rebuild stronger than they were before the pandemic, such as investing billions to build a diverse educator workforce, expand access to pre-K to all families, and invest in school infrastructure, among other provisions."

6-Jul-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-invites-states-and-school-districts-apply-additional-600-million-american-rescue-plan-funds-students-experiencing-homelessness,U.S. Department of Education Invites States and School Districts to Apply for Additional $600 Million in American Rescue Plan Funds for Students Experiencing Homelessness,"To help support the needs of students experiencing homelessness, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) today is inviting states to complete the application for their share of the second disbursement of $800 million in funding under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021’s Homeless Children and Youth Fund (ARP-HCY) . In April, the Department released the first $200 million of the $800 million in ARP-HCY funds to states. The distribution of the additional $600 million will give states and school districts access to funding before the beginning of the 2021-2022 school year. ""Even before the coronavirus pandemic highlighted and exacerbated inequities in America’s education system, students experiencing homelessness faced numerous challenges as they strove to learn and achieve in school each day. Amid COVID-19 and the transition to remote and hybrid learning, for so many students, these challenges intensified. As a nation, we must do everything we can to ensure that all students—including students experiencing homelessness and housing insecurity—are able to access an excellent education that opens doors to opportunity and thriving lives,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “I encourage every state to urgently use these American Rescue Plan funds to support homeless children and youth so that these students have every chance to participate in summer learning and enrichment; experience full-time, in-person instruction in their schools in the fall; and get connected to vital services and supports that can support their success."" The needs of students experiencing homelessness remain urgent, as many schools and districts struggle to identify and serve students who experience homelessness. The ARP-HCY funds are designed to be flexible so that states and districts can address community needs. This additional ARP-HCY funding will be used by states and school districts to identify homeless children and youth, provide wraparound services in light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and provide assistance to enable homeless children and youth to attend school and participate fully in school activities. ""Every child deserves to have a warm place to sleep and a roof over their head every night. But for 1.5 million children across America and over 10,000 children in my home state of West Virginia, that is not the case. The COVID-19 pandemic made this heartbreaking and dire issue much worse for many of our families and children in need. Since the pandemic kept most students at home, schools have struggled to track students experiencing homelessness,” said Sen. Joe Manchin. “This second round of funding—part of the $800 million I successfully fought to include in the American Rescue Plan—will help schools identify students experiencing homelessness and provide support for these vulnerable students. States can begin applying for the second round of funding today in order to get the funds directly to school districts before the new school year so students experiencing homelessness can receive the support they need."" ""This past year has been so difficult for every student, parent and educator across the country—but what students experiencing homelessness have gone through is unthinkable. The first thing we told people during this pandemic was to ‘stay home.’ But so many students don’t have a safe place to call home, access to internet, devices, or critical services that students have relied on to learn during this pandemic,” said Sen. Patty Murray. “We fought hard to make sure the American Rescue Plan includes dedicated funding for students experiencing homelessness, and I’m so pleased the Department of Education is acting quickly to get these resources to our communities. The crisis of youth homelessness is especially acute for LGBTQ young people and children of color, and I’ll keep fighting to make sure students experiencing homelessness not only get enrolled in school, but also get the kind of support and stability they need so they can learn and grow in the classroom."" Following a brief application, states will receive funds that will be awarded to school districts through formula subgrants. These funds will reach districts that may not have accessed previous federal funding designated for students experiencing homelessness. Under the final requirements that will be published in the Federal Register, states are required to distribute funds to school districts via a formula that uses the district’s allocation under Title I, Part A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 and the number of identified homeless children and youth in either the 2018-19 or 2019-20 school year, whichever number is greater. With the exception of the district subgranting formula, which replaces the competitive subgrant process required by the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (McKinney-Vento Act), all requirements of the McKinney-Vento Act also apply to the ARP-HCY funds. The distribution of ARP-HCY funds is part of the Department’s broader efforts to support students and districts as they work to reengage students impacted by the pandemic, address inequities exacerbated by COVID-19, and build our education system back better than before. In addition to providing $130 billion for K-12 education in the American Rescue Plan to support the safe reopening of K-12 schools and meet the needs of all students, the Biden-Harris Administration has: Released three volumes of the COVID-19 Handbook Held a National Safe School Reopening Summit Helped over 175 million Americans ages 12 and older get vaccinated Provided $10 billion in funding for COVID-19 testing for PreK-12 educators, staff, and students Prioritized the vaccination of educators and other school staff Launched a series of Equity Summits focused on addressing inequities that existed before, but were made worse by the pandemic Released a report on the disparate impacts of COVID-19 on underserved communities, including homeless youth Developed a Safer Schools and Campuses Best Practices Clearinghouse elevating hundreds of best practices to support schools’ efforts to reopen safely and address the impacts of COVID-19 on students, educators, and communities."
1-Jul-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/department-education-implements-teach-grant-program-changes-benefit-teachers-and-students,Department of Education Implements TEACH Grant Program Changes to Benefit Teachers and Students,"The U.S. Department of Education (ED) today announced changes to the Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant Program, the only federal student aid grant program that directly benefits teachers working in high-need fields and underserved schools. ED implemented the changes as the Biden-Harris Administration proposes further enhancements to the program through the American Families Plan , which would double the annual grant amount, increase program flexibilities, address high grant-to-loan conversion rates, and ensure better outcomes for teachers and students. ""Our teachers are champions of students' potential and stewards of their success. Respecting and honoring teachers who serve students with the greatest needs also requires that we ensure these educators receive the support to which they are entitled from this important federal program without having to jump through unnecessary hoops,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""The changes announced today deliver much-needed improvements to the TEACH Grant. And, through the American Families Plan, even greater investments will be made in the program to strengthen teacher pipelines into the profession, support teacher retention, and address critical teacher shortages so that every child across America can be taught by well-prepared and outstanding educators."" About the TEACH Grant Program The TEACH Grant Program provides grants of up to $4,000 each year to students who are completing or plan to complete course work needed to begin a teaching career. Unlike other federal student grants, the TEACH Grant requires recipients to agree to complete four years of teaching in a high-need field and underserved school as a condition for receiving the grant. For each year that a TEACH Grant is awarded, the recipient must complete online counseling that explains the terms and conditions of the grant and sign an agreement in which the recipient agrees to teach at a school or educational service agency that serves students from low-income backgrounds, and in a high-need field. Before today, if a recipient did not complete the required four years of teaching within an eight-year period—referred to as the service obligation—or submit the required documentation within eight years after graduating from or otherwise stop attending the school where the TEACH Grant was awarded, the TEACH Grant was converted into a Direct Unsubsidized Loan that must be repaid in full. The loan included interest accumulated from the grant's disbursement date. Program Changes Now in Effect The TEACH Grant Program rules now provide greater flexibility and processes remove pain points grant recipients previously experienced navigating the program. Among the regulatory changes taking effect today: TEACH Grant Exit Counseling is required, and the counseling will inform recipients that the TEACH Grant servicer, FedLoan Servicing, will now send detailed annual notifications to recipients that include service obligation requirements and timelines, documentation reminders, accrued interest estimates, and explanations about the reconversion process. TEACH Grant recipients will no longer have their grants converted to loans if they do not certify that they have begun teaching or intend to begin teaching within 120 days of graduating or withdrawing from school, and there is no requirement for recipients to certify their intent to teach within 120 days of graduating or separating from school. If TEACH Grant recipients do not certify at the end of each year of teaching completed, their grants are not converted to loans until they do not have enough time to complete the required four years of service within the eight-year deadline. ED expanded the reasons that a TEACH Grant recipient's service obligation may be suspended for a period of time and a TEACH Grant recipient may teach for less than a full academic year, but still receive credit for the full academic year. ED simplified program requirements to allow TEACH Grant recipients to group together undergraduate and graduate service obligations, when possible. The reconsideration process is now open to all TEACH Grant recipients whose grants have converted to loans. The program changes provide additional relief for recipients whose TEACH Grants were converted to loans in error. In addition to the TEACH Grant Program changes, ED's office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) launched new and improved digital forms and resources to help guide and inform TEACH Grant recipients. FSA updated existing TEACH Grant counseling features and the Agreement to Serve or Repay and added a new counseling feature, TEACH Grant Conversion Counseling. This counseling feature provides information about the conditions under which a TEACH Grant is converted to a Direct Unsubsidized Loan. American Families Plan Proposals to Enhance the TEACH Program The Biden-Harris Administration introduced TEACH Grant Program enhancements as part of the American Families Plan that build on the improvements implemented today, while continuing to address teacher shortages in high-need fields such as special education, career and technical education, science, technology, engineering, and math. The proposed plan also aims to increase the access that students from low-income backgrounds and students of color have to comprehensive teacher preparation. The American Families Plan would double the TEACH Grant amount from $4,000 to $8,000 per year for juniors, seniors, and graduate students, in addition to the $4,000 students would receive in their freshman and sophomore year. The plan also aims to increase access to the program by removing the grade point average requirement and expanding it to early childhood educators that go on to serve in programs that disproportionately serve students from low-income backgrounds. Increasing the award amount will align the grant with the average cost of undergraduate education and ensure that teacher candidates have access to comprehensive programs that support effective teaching and that they can enter and remain in the profession without burdensome loans or debt. These changes are expected to increase the number of recipients by more than 50 percent to nearly 40,000 in 2022. In Academic Year 2019–20, nearly 27,000 students at more than 740 institutions received awards through the TEACH Grant Program. The American Families Plan would also reduce the repayment burden on recipients who do not complete their service requirement through reforms including: Not capitalizing interest upon conversion to a loan; Reducing the amount that converts to a loan for years of service completed; and Allowing promotions into schoolwide roles (e.g., principal) in a high-needs school to count toward the service obligation. Finally, the American Families Plan would ensure better outcomes for recipients and the students they teach by phasing in quality guardrails on program eligibility based on grant recipient outcomes. The program changes are now reflected on the TEACH Grant Program page at StudentAid.gov/teach and on the TEACH Grant loan servicer's website. The servicer will contact grant recipients affected by the program changes. In addition to doubling the TEACH Grant award, the American Families Plan (AFP) includes proposals to support teachers and build a diverse teacher pipeline. The plan includes $2.8 billion in investments in Grow Your Own programs and year-long, paid teacher residency programs, which have a greater impact on student outcomes, teacher retention, and are more likely to enroll teacher candidates of color. Additionally, the AFP targets $400 million for teacher preparation at Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal Colleges and Universities, and minority-serving institutions and $900 million for the development of special education teachers. The AFP invests $2 billion to support programs that leverage teachers as leaders, such as serving as mentors in high-quality mentorship programs for new teachers and teachers of color. The AFP will also support over 100,000 current teachers in answering the call to support their school communities by earning additional certifications in high-demand areas like special education and bilingual education.

The new funding will help aid more than 7.9 million infants, toddlers, and students served under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and adds to the ARP Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief allocation of $122 billion in state funding for K-12 schools, which the department announced in March. Today’s announcement reaffirms the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to addressing inequities exacerbated by the pandemic and targeting resources to historically underserved communities through the American Rescue Plan and other relief efforts. “We know that COVID-19 and disruptions in access to in-person learning over the last year have taken a disproportionate toll on America’s children with disabilities, who, far too often amid the pandemic, experienced challenges in receiving the services and supports that they were entitled to,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “It’s long past time that the federal government makes good on its commitment to students with disabilities and their families, and today’s announcement is one of many steps the Biden-Harris Administration has taken to support students with disabilities. With these crucial American Rescue Plan funds, our early intervention providers and schools will be better able to address the needs of infants, toddlers, children, and youth with disabilities and ensure our education system reemerges even stronger than before the pandemic.” In addition to releasing the funds, the Department of Education released a fact sheet describing how IDEA funds within ARP can be used by states to support infants, toddlers, children, and youth with disabilities. Today’s more than $3 billion in funds were allocated within Section 2014(a) of the ARP and will add to IDEA’s three major formula grants programs: $2.6 billion for IDEA Part B Grants to States (Section 611) for children and youth with disabilities aged 3 through 21. $200 million for IDEA Part B Preschool Grants (Section 619) for children with disabilities aged 3 through 5. $250 million for IDEA Part C Grants for infants and toddlers with disabilities and their families. The Department’s Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP) will administer and monitor the ARP section 2014(a) funds to states and other designated agencies. In general, these awards are subject to the same requirements under IDEA and the Uniform Guidance as all IDEA funds. The table below outlines the amount of funding each state educational agency or designated agency received from the ARP section 2014(a).

28-Jun-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/education-department-provides-nearly-4-billion-pandemic-relief-aid-and-other-grants-puerto-rico-department-education-secretary-cardona-visits-commonwealth,Education Department Provides Nearly $4 Billion in Pandemic Relief Aid and Other Grants to Puerto Rico Department of Education as Secretary Cardona Visits the Commonwealth,"U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona today informed The Honorable Pedro Pierluisi, Governor of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and The Honorable Eliezer Ramos, Interim Secretary of Education, that the Puerto Rico Department of Education (PRDE) now has full access to all federal education pandemic relief funds earmarked for the Commonwealth and other education program grant dollars. The additional funds available as of today, totaling nearly $4 billion, include: $2 billion from the American Rescue Plan Act; $1.2 billion from the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2021 (CRRSA); and $662 million in FY 2020 program grants. In the letter to Governor Pierluisi and Interim Secretary of Education Ramos, Secretary Cardona wrote: “I wish to personally affirm the Department’s commitment to working collaboratively with Puerto Rico and PRDE so that we can attain our shared goal of educational excellence for the children, students and youth of the Commonwealth. We acknowledge your commitment and progress in strengthening academic services and financial management. I know that by working together, we will deliver on this fundamental promise.” Today’s announcement comes as Secretary Cardona begins a visit to Puerto Rico where he will meet with government and educational leaders and students of the Commonwealth. Secretary Cardona is the first member of President Biden’s Cabinet to visit Puerto Rico, and during the trip, he will reinforce the Biden Administration’s commitment to the island and its continued support for Puerto Rico’s K-12 and higher education students, educators, and families. “ Me siento orgulloso , I am honored to be in Puerto Rico—the island of my roots—as the federal government releases critical funds to support Puerto Rico’s efforts to safely reopen its schools for in-person learning and to provide all students on the island with the opportunity to pursue their passions and achieve their dreams,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “Today’s announcement reinforces the Biden Administration’s strong partnership with the island and underscores our shared commitment to supporting Puerto Rico’s students, educators, and families. I look forward to the progress we will continue to make together now, and in the weeks and months ahead.” Today’s announcement follows a series of actions the Biden Administration took in its first months in office to support Puerto Rico students, educators, and families. As part of the American Rescue Plan (ARP), Puerto Rico was allocated nearly $3 billion in ARP Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) funding to support their efforts to reopen K-12 schools safely and equitably expand opportunity for students who need it most. On March 22, Secretary Cardona sent a letter to Governor Pierluisi informing him that the Department had provided the Commonwealth immediate access to $912 million in federal education funds, which had not been available to Puerto Rico as a result of previously imposed grant conditions. The release of those funds marked a commitment from the Department and the Biden-Harris Administration in supporting Puerto Rico. It also recognized the notable progress ;the Commonwealth has made in taking steps to ensure sound fiscal management of federal education funds while working to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic and the natural disasters that have impacted students, families, and educators across the island. And most recently in early June, the Department released $210 million in ESSER II funds to Puerto Rico, awarded under the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2021. Those federal resources enabled PRDE to implement a robust summer learning and enrichment program through its Summer Academy. As with all students nationwide, the summer presents a key opportunity for school and community partners in Puerto Rico to accelerate learning and provide new avenues for students to safely engage with each other. Today’s release of nearly $4 billion in funds represents all of the remaining funding that had previously not been available to Puerto Rico, including both pandemic relief funds and annual program grants. The Department has worked in partnership with Puerto Rico to put in place enhanced oversight and accountability measures to ensure that these resources result in impactful programs for the students of the Commonwealth and are spent in compliance with the applicable laws and other requirements. PRDE recently finalized the agreement with its selected third-party fiduciary agent (TPFA) and the TPFA is ready to perform financial management duties. The Department remains eager to provide needed resources and support to the Commonwealth’s schools and students in the wake of the pandemic."
24-Jun-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/statement-miguel-cardona-secretary-education-policies-and-priorities-us-department-education,Statement by Miguel Cardona Secretary of Education on the Policies and Priorities of the U.S. Department of Education,"Good morning Chair Scott and Ranking Member Foxx. I am pleased to join you today, and I am proud to testify about the policies and priorities of the Department of Education, including President Biden's fiscal year 2022 Budget Request for the Department of Education. The full fiscal year 2022 Budget Request, which was released a little over two weeks ago, makes good on President Biden's campaign commitment to reverse years of underinvestment in Federal education programs and would begin to address the significant inequities that millions of students—primarily students of color—and teachers confront every day in underserved schools across America. These inequities in opportunity and access continue to be experienced by students pursuing higher education and career and technical education credentials as well. American Rescue Plan Act Before I begin, I want to thank the Members of the Subcommittee—and your staff—who helped carry the American Rescue Plan Act to the finish line. I can tell you from immediate experience that the ARP funds will make all the difference in ensuring that schools re-open for full-time, in-person instruction as safely and soon as possible. In addition, ARP funds will enable schools to address the mental health, social, and emotional needs of students that the pandemic has laid bare, and to fully recover from the massive impact of lost instructional time on student achievement during the pandemic. The plans to reopen are bold – and will require coordination among key stakeholders at the Federal, State, and local levels. But they match the urgency the challenges before us demand. It's important to remember that once we fully reopen schools, we still have work to do. Our job will not be done. Generations of inequity have left far too many students without equitable access to high-quality, inclusive learning opportunities. Education can be the great equalizer – it was for me – if we prioritize, replicate, and invest in what works for all students, not just some. We must do more to level the playing field, including providing a strong foundation from birth, improving diversity among the teacher workforce, and creating learning pathways that work for all students. To that end, the fiscal year 2022 budget proposal for the Department of Education provides strong investments in key areas to ensure students of all ages have what they need to succeed. Department of Education Funding Levels The President's fiscal year 2022 request calls for a significant and long-overdue increase in Federal support for education from birth through college and career. The proposed discretionary request of $103 billion for Department of Education programs, an increase of almost $30 billion over the fiscal year 2021 enacted level, would be complemented by additional mandatory investments under the American Jobs Plan and the American Families Plan. We understand that some have raised questions about the unprecedented increase in Federal education funding proposed by President Biden, particularly coming on top of emergency appropriations over the past year to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our schools. However, it's important to recognize that these bold proposals follow a decade of virtually no funding growth in real terms for Department programs, a significant under-investment in light of the rising needs of students and families. The $73.5 billion that Congress appropriated for the Department for the current fiscal year, fiscal year 2021, is about 8 percent more than the fiscal year 2011 total of $68.3 billion. Title I funding did a little better, up 10 percent, or 1 percent a year, over the same period of time. The total Federal investment in elementary and secondary education grew at the same rate—just 1 percent annually over the past 10 years—not even keeping up with inflation. Funding Inequities in State and Local Education Systems This underinvestment in K-12 education matters because of the dramatic and longstanding inequities in State and local education funding systems, which despite more than half a century of litigation and reform, too often continue to provide significantly less funding for high-poverty districts and schools, which are more likely to serve students of color, resulting in a disproportionate impact on these students. Reversing these funding inequities, as well as immediately addressing the negative impact of those inequities in service of students, are critical goals of the Biden-Harris Administration's racial equity agenda, and the President's fiscal year 2022 request for the Department of Education would make a meaningful down payment toward these goals. Addressing these inequities are critical to our nation's future. Our country and our economy will be stronger when every child is prepared to succeed in tomorrow's economy, regardless of race, zip code, their family's income, or disability. Investment in Title I Grants to Local Educational Agencies The centerpiece of that request is $20 billion for a new Title I Equity Grants program—part of the President's commitment to dramatically increase funding for Title I schools—that would help address long-standing funding disparities between under-resourced school districts and their wealthier counterparts; ensure teachers in Title I schools are paid competitively; support expanded access to preschool; and increase preparation for, access to, and success in the rigorous coursework needed to prepare for postsecondary education and high-paying, in-demand careers. This proposal will further the goals of Title I as outlined by President Johnson in partnership with Congress back in 1965 as part of the War on Poverty, to help ensure that all students—especially students from low-income backgrounds and students of color in underserved communities—receive the high-quality education they need to thrive and achieve their dreams. Investment in Improving Students' Physical and Mental Health Long before the COVID-19 pandemic there was increasing evidence that the conditions of poverty—especially concentrated poverty—take a tragic toll on the physical and mental health of students. This warrants significant investments in mitigating the impact of this toll in order to improve student outcomes. Congress recognized this problem, in part, through the creation and rapid increase in funding for the Title IV-A Student Support and Academic Enrichment program. Our request would build on these efforts through a $1 billion investment for a new School-Based Health Professionals program to support the mental health needs of our students by increasing the number of counselors, nurses, and mental health professionals in our schools, and building the pipeline for these critical staff, with an emphasis on underserved schools. Community-Based Programs In addition, the President's request would help increase the availability of a broad range of wrap-around services to students and families in underserved schools and communities through a significant expansion of the Full-Service Community Schools program, from $30 million in fiscal year 2021 to $443 million in fiscal year 2022. This program recognizes the role of schools as the centers of our communities and neighborhoods, and funds efforts to identify and integrate the wide range of community-based resources needed to support students and their families, expand learning opportunities for students and parents alike, support collaborative leadership and practices, and promote the family and community engagement that can help ensure student success. The request would support implementation of the community schools model at roughly 800 additional schools serving up to 2.4 million students, family members, and community members. Our request also would help strengthen communities by fostering diverse schools through renewed efforts to improve school racial and socioeconomic diversity. We would provide $100 million for a new Fostering Diverse Schools program that would help communities develop and implement strategies that will build more racially and socioeconomically diverse schools. Research suggests that diverse learning environments benefit all students and can improve student achievement, serve as engines of social and economic mobility, and promote school improvement. Our proposal also would build evidence around effective practices for addressing the growing concern that our Nation's schools are becoming less diverse and more segregated each year. Support for Special Education We also think it is past time for the Federal Government to make good on its commitment to students with disabilities and their families, as expressed in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. The President's request makes a significant move toward full funding of the IDEA with a $2.6 billion, or 20 percent, increase for IDEA Part B Grants to States above the regular fiscal year 2021 appropriation, for a total of $15.5 billion. Notably, this increase would raise the Federal share of the excess cost of serving students with disabilities for the first time in 8 years—demonstrating that IDEA has been yet another casualty of the Federal underinvestment in education over the past 10 years. In addition, we would increase funding for the IDEA Part C Grants for the Infants and Families program by more than 50 percent, or $250 million above the regular fiscal year 2021 appropriation level, for a total of $732 million to expand access to early intervention services for infants and toddlers with disabilities. We would pair this increased funding with reforms to strengthen the Part C program, particularly for children who have been historically underrepresented in the program, including children of color. The President's Request would also boost the Preschool Grants program by $105 million over the 2021 appropriation, to aid in the provision of special education and related services for children with disabilities aged 3 through 5. Teacher Training and Support The Title I Equity Grants proposal is just one demonstration of President Biden's strong commitment to teachers. Other key investments, split between discretionary and mandatory American Families Plan funding, include $412 million ($132 million in discretionary funding and an additional $280 in mandatory authority for fiscal year 2022) for Teacher Quality Partnerships to address teaching shortages, improve training and supports for teachers, and boost teacher diversity, particularly through investment in teacher residencies and Grow Your Own programs; $340 million ($250 million in discretionary funding and an additional $90 million in mandatory authority for fiscal year 2022) for Special Education Personnel Preparation to ensure that there are adequate numbers of personnel with the skills and knowledge necessary to help children with disabilities succeed educationally; and $60 million ($20 million in discretionary funding and an additional $40 in mandatory authority for fiscal year 2022) to fund for the first time the Hawkins Centers of Excellence program designed to increase the quality and number of new teachers of color. In addition, the American Families Plan would make a one-time mandatory investment of $1.6 billion to support additional certifications at no cost for more than 100,000 educators in high-demand areas like special education, bilingual education, career and technical education, and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. We are also requesting, through the American Families Plan, $200 million in mandatory authority for a new Expanding Opportunities for Teacher Leadership and Development program to support opportunities for experienced and effective teachers to lead and have a greater impact on their school community while remaining in the classroom (and be compensated for additional responsibilities) through such activities as high-quality teacher mentorship programs and job-embedded coaching. Lastly, the American Families Plan would double TEACH Grants from $4,000 to $8,000 for future teachers while earning their degrees. Improving Career Pathways The President's Request also recognizes that a skilled workforce is critical for both strong communities and a strong economy by proposing to make targeted investments that would help build the capacity of our workforce development system. These investments include an increase of $108 million in Career and Technical Education National Programs to support an innovation grants initiative focused on youth work-based learning and industry credential attainment, along with a $25 million increase under Adult Education National Leadership Activities to expand college bridge programs for low-skilled adults without a high school degree. In addition, the American Jobs Plan would provide $1 billion in mandatory funding in fiscal year 2022 ($10 billion total over 10 years) to expand career pathways for underserved middle and high school students that include partnerships with employers, community colleges and other partners and allow students to earn credentials or college credit while still in high school; and also would invest $100 million annually over the next 10 years to help connect job-seeking adults to employment opportunities by focusing on foundational skills and embedded career services. Postsecondary Education Investments Turning to higher education, our budget proposal would make postsecondary education more affordable for students from low-income households through a $400 increase to the maximum Pell Grant. In combination with the $1,475 increase to the maximum Pell Grant proposed in the American Families Plan, the increase in 2022 would be the largest increase to the Pell Grant ever. This historic increase is just a first step in a more comprehensive proposal to double the grant. Importantly, our proposal also would ensure that postsecondary students who are DACA recipients may receive Pell Grants and other federal aid if they meet current eligibility requirements. Through the American Families Plan, our budget proposal would provide two years of free community college to first-time students and those wishing to reskill. It would also make college more affordable for low- and middle-income students at four-year Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), and Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) such as Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) and Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institutions (AANAPISIs). The fiscal year 2022 request also would increase institutional capacity and student supports at HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs, and other under-resourced institutions, such as community colleges. The discretionary request includes more than $600 million in additional funding for institutional supports programs and programs like TRIO and GEAR UP, to help ensure underserved students succeed in and graduate from college. The American Families Plan also provides historic mandatory investments over ten years in college access and success, including $46 billion for HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs, and $62 billion for a new Completion Grants program that would make formula grants to States to support the use of evidence-based strategies to strengthen completion and retention rates at institutions that serve students from our most disadvantaged communities like community colleges. School Infrastructure Too many students attend schools and child care centers that are run-down, unsafe, and pose health risks. These conditions are dangerous for our kids and exist disproportionately in schools with a high percentage of low-income students and students of color. We can't close the opportunity gap if low-income kids go to schools in buildings that undermine health and safety, while wealthier students get access to safe buildings with labs and technology that prepare them for the jobs of the future. Accordingly, the American Jobs Plan would provide $10 billion in mandatory funding in 2022, and $50 billion over five years, for grants to upgrade existing school facilities and build new public elementary and secondary schools. Outside of the Department of Education, funding would leverage an additional $50 billion in investments in school infrastructure through bonds. The American Jobs Plan would also provide $2.4 billion in mandatory funding in 2022, and $12 billion over five years, for grants to invest in community college facilities and technology in order to help protect the health and safety of students and faculty, address education deserts (particularly for rural communities), grow local economies, improve energy efficiency and resilience, and narrow funding inequities. Student Aid Administration In addition to making college more affordable, our budget proposal will improve the services we provide students and families to help them pay for college. We are requesting $2.1 billion to administer the Federal student aid programs in fiscal year 2022, an increase of $200 million over the fiscal year 2021 appropriation. The requested funds are necessary to implement the FAFSA® Simplification Act and FUTURE Act, which together will greatly ease the process of applying for student aid and accessing affordable, income-driven repayment options; provide high-quality loan servicing to more than 40 million student loan borrowers; and protect the personally identifiable information of around 75 million students and parents. Enforcement of Civil Rights Laws Finally, we would prioritize efforts to enforce the Nation's civil rights laws, as they relate to education, through a 10 percent increase for the Office for Civil Rights to protect students, providing a total of $144 million to advance equity in educational opportunity and delivery at Pre-K through 12 schools and at institutions of higher education. Closing Remarks Thank you again for this opportunity to share more about the President's plan to invest in students of all ages and the institutions that serve them. I look forward to hearing your reactions to this historic budget request, and to learning more about your individual interests and priorities related to Department of Education programs and activities. I am committed to working collaboratively with each of you, to the greatest extent possible, to help improve educational opportunities and outcomes for all students. Thank you, and I will do my best to respond to any questions you may have."

""Today marks 49 years since the passage of Title IX, the strongest tool we have to protect every student's right to equal access to educational opportunities free from sex discrimination. Because of this landmark rule, our nation has made important progress toward realizing our self-concept as a land of opportunity for all—from increasing equality in science, technology, engineering and math education; to enabling and encouraging more women and girls to participate in sports; to ensuring fairer funding in athletic programs; to protecting students from sex discrimination, including sexual violence. Amid this progress, we recognize there is still more to do, when we know that students still experience harassment, exclusion from school activities, and other forms of discrimination that stand in the way of them reaching their full potential and their dreams. I'm proud of the actions the Biden-Harris Administration has taken so far in ensuring that Title IX protects the civil rights of all students, including LGBTQ+ students, in our schools and on college campuses. As Secretary of Education, I am committed to ensuring Title IX works for all students and provides equal access to opportunities that will enrich students' educational experiences and their futures."" *** In observance of Title IX's 49th anniversary, the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights today issued a Dear Educator Letter and, in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division, a new fact sheet: Confronting Anti-LGBTQI+ Harassment in Schools: A Resource for Students and Families.

During the summit, participants highlighted the Biden Administration’s historic commitment to advancing equity in school reopening, recovery, and long-term investments in education, including: Through the American Rescue Plan, ensuring that schools not only have the resources to re-open for in-person instruction quickly, but also ensuring that schools are focused on investing in meeting the social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs of the students most impacted by COVID-19—who are often the same students who were furthest from opportunity before the pandemic, and doubling the number of school counselors, social workers, and school psychologists. Through the American Families Plan , expanding access to pre-K and free community college, and investing in our educators, and building a diverse pipeline so every student from every background can be supported by teachers, mentors, and staff who share and understand their experiences. Through historic investments in the President’s FY2022 Budget, more than doubling funding for Title I schools through new equity grants that will incentivize states to address inequitable school funding systems. Working towards fully funding the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Highlights from the summit included remarks from educators, leaders, students, and Biden Administration officials discussing the opportunities to reimagine our schools so they work for all students, particularly those in historically underserved communities. See excerpts of the conversation below: First Lady Jill Biden: ""For many years schools across the country have grappled with issues of inequity, especially our students of color, those from low income homes, students with disabilities, and English language learners. As we recover from this pandemic, it's on all of us to ensure we don't return to the same broken systems of the past, but build back better than before. And that’s exactly what our administration is committed to doing."" U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona: ""Equity in education is about providing all students, from all backgrounds and all parts of the country, with the resources and supports that they need to succeed and thrive in our society. It’s about providing them pathways to contribute to their communities, and to make the world a better place. Equity is not a passing buzzword, but an ongoing, continuous effort to make sure that every student feels supported in their classrooms and in every educational environment. That’s why this summit isn’t a one-time event for us – but something that will be infused in all of our work at the department and across the Administration for the next four years."" U.S. Deputy Secretary of Education Cindy Marten: ""As we work to reopen schools this summer and fall, we have an opportunity and responsibility to reflect on teaching and learning, best practices, and what did and didn’t work when we all had to rethink what it meant to be a student, teacher, principal, and more, and we had to do this at a moment’s notice, almost a year and a half ago. Now, with the benefit of hindsight, and the luxury of foresight, we will build back better, with urgency, intentionality, and joy, in the service of every student."" Dean of USC Rossier School of Education Pedro Noguera: ""Many of us have come from low income backgrounds, faced adversity and challenges but we used education to improve our lives, so we know it's possible. The real challenge that we face is how do we make that happen for more kids, and while the pandemic set us back, there's no reason why we have to stay back. If we can think holistically about the needs of children, and recognize how their social, emotional, and psychological needs are related to their academic and intellectual. There's no reason why we can't produce better outcomes, for all kinds of children across the country, and this should not be a controversial issue. This is really at the core of why we have public education"" 2021 DC Teacher of the Year Alejandro Diasgranados said this of increasing and retaining teachers of colors: ""Especially right now I'm afraid that the teaching profession might be at risk of losing a lot of great teachers of color, and right now that's not something that we can afford. For me it's personal because I only joined the profession after having an inspiring teacher of color who introduced me to the field of education. So I think that if we want to retain the teachers that we have, I think it starts with listening to the great teachers that we already have in classrooms. Also, pairing new teachers with veteran mentor teachers and, in order to prevent them from feeling isolated, creating different affinity spaces for teachers just so they can discuss different challenges and offer ongoing support mentorship and encouragement."" Tweets Sonya O. Hunte (@HunteSonya) : This first installation of the #EquitySummit was amazing! insight is: Equity is giving each student what they need, when, how, and where they need it. Another takeaway is parent/caretaker & student voice. Silvina Jover (@LatinaComm) : The #EquitySummit organized by the @USEducationDept this morning was rich in content, shared experiences. White Plains District in #NY brought their #DualLanguage IC as a pivotal member of the conversation surrounding Equity and Inclusion.

Participants will discuss the historic investments in the American Rescue Plan aimed at advancing equity in school reopening efforts, as well as how the proposals outlined in President Biden’s FY2022 Budget, the American Families Plan, and the American Jobs Plan can address inequities that were exacerbated by the pandemic and help build truly equitable schools across the country. The event will also feature discussions on how students can access a high-quality education responsive to their needs, and how schools can create more culturally and linguistically responsive and inclusive learning environments for all students.

21-Jun-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/secretary-cardona-holds-virtual-listening-learning-roundtable-rural-youth-across-nation,"Secretary Cardona Holds Virtual Listening, Learning Roundtable with Rural Youth From Across the Nation","Today, U.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona held a virtual roundtable conversation with rural students from grades 6-12. The Secretary discussed with participants what it was like to be a rural student during the pandemic as well as hear from them on what the Department can do to support them and improve their learning experience. After welcoming the students to the roundtable, Secretary Cardona opened the discussion saying that he has been talking to different students from across the country to hear their perspectives and incorporate their experiences into the Department's work. ""Compared to urban schools, rural community schools have a hard time offering a wider variety of classes and extracurriculars,"" he said. ""Our conversation today will help us focus on how we can best provide more opportunities for students in rural communities to get the same educational experience that students in larger schools are getting."" The students shared some of the challenges they faced attending a rural school and also provided feedback on what they hope will improve when they return to school in the fall. ""I hope there's more emphasis on technology, especially now that we know how to use it and how to use the different platforms,"" said Sheyenne, an 11th grader from North Dakota. Most of the students agreed with Sheyenne that technology was important when returning to school but having better bandwidth to use the technology was also essential. ""This was extremely beneficial to me as your Secretary of Education,"" he said. ""It's our job to serve you. We listen to what's working, what's not working and what we could do better."" During the conversation, the Secretary also emphasized the components within the American Families Plan that will support rural communities and students. The American Families Plan will provide nearly $193 million for rural education. Based on 2018 data from the National Center for Education Statistics, 28 percent of the Nation's public schools were located in rural areas, with 19 percent of all public school students enrolled at these schools."
16-Jun-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/secretary-cardona-holds-virtual-roundtable-early-childhood-stakeholders-discuss-priorities-early-learning,Secretary Cardona Holds Virtual Roundtable with Early Childhood Stakeholders to Discuss Priorities for Early Learning,"Today, U.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona held a virtual roundtable conversation with a diverse group of early childhood stakeholders and leaders who bring perspective from the experiences of early educators, families, and communities during the public health emergency. Today's conversation will help inform the Department's early learning priorities. Topics that the early childhood stakeholders discussed included the early educator workforce, childcare and pre-K, early intervention and early childhood special education services, and family supports. Secretary Cardona opened the discussion saying, ""We know that this upcoming year is going to be critically important, and this conversation today is going to help shape some of the work that we do in early learning. We have the early learning heavyweights from across the country on this call. I'd love your perspective on how we can build back better."" ""I think we've seen a renewed coming together of parents as teachers, and teachers, realizing that they're in this together and I think you can build upon that,"" said Joan Lombardi, senior scholar at Georgetown University and international expert on child development and social policy. ""I can't reinforce enough how much we need to revolutionize the K-3 system &helip; and the childcare and pre-school discussion…they should be planning together in a community."" Lea Austin, director of the Center for the Study of Childcare Employment at UC Berkeley, said, ""We know in this country that 98% of other occupations are paid more than people who are working with our youngest children. And within that, we know that we have some serious racial inequities and wage gaps. As we think about building back better, for me it really means having those educators who are the linchpin to early care and education quality, thriving and for these to be good jobs so that we have people clamoring to be early educators in this country."" Secretary Cardona closed the conversation saying, ""I want to go from these conversations to actually planning. Going back to what it was prior to March 2020 is not the goal; that's a low bar. ""I've visited about 11 states already during and after the tour, and those places that are doing the best are the ones that understand intentional collaboration; that doesn't mean you agree…but be intentional about making sure you're putting students at the center of the conversation. ""Supporting the development of our young children and families should be a community effort because when our children succeed, our communities succeed."""

Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in any education program or activity offered by a recipient of federal financial assistance. The Department's interpretation stems from the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in Bostock v. Clayton County , issued one year ago this week, in which the Supreme Court recognized that it is impossible to discriminate against a person based on their sexual orientation or gender identity without discriminating against that person based on sex. ""The Supreme Court has upheld the right for LGBTQ+ people to live and work without fear of harassment, exclusion, and discrimination – and our LGBTQ+ students have the same rights and deserve the same protections. I'm proud to have directed the Office for Civil Rights to enforce Title IX to protect all students from all forms of sex discrimination,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""Today, the Department makes clear that all students—including LGBTQ+ students—deserve the opportunity to learn and thrive in schools that are free from discrimination."" As OCR recently reported , LGBTQ+ students often face additional challenges in schools, including disproportionately experiencing persistent bullying, harassment, and victimization. The vulnerability of LGBTQ+ students has only increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, leaving them without access to school-based mental health services and other supports. One survey found that 78 percent of transgender and nonbinary youth reported that their mental health was ""poor"" either most of the time or always during COVID-19, compared with 61 percent of cisgender youth. ""The Department of Education strives to provide schools with the support they need to create learning environments that enable all students to succeed, regardless of their gender identity or sexual orientation. Equity in education means all students have access to schools that allow them to learn and thrive in all aspects of their educational experience,"" said Acting Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Suzanne B. Goldberg. ""As part of our mission to protect all students' civil rights, it is essential that OCR acts to eliminate discrimination that targets LGBTQ+ students."" Today's Notice of Interpretation continues OCR's sustained effort to promote safe and inclusive schools for all students, including LGBTQ+ students. This action is part of the Biden-Harris Administration's commitment to advance the rights of the LGBTQ+ community, set out in President Biden's Executive Order on Guaranteeing an Educational Environment Free from Discrimination on the Basis of Sex, Including Sexual Orientation or Gender Identity and the Executive Order on Preventing and Combating Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity or Sexual Orientation .

16-Jun-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/statement-miguel-cardona-secretary-education-us-department-education-fiscal-year-2022-budget-request,Statement by Miguel Cardona Secretary of Education on the U.S. Department of Education Fiscal Year 2022 Budget Request,"Good morning Chairwoman Murray and Ranking Member Blunt. I am pleased to join you today, and I am proud to testify on behalf of President Biden's fiscal year 2022 Budget Request for the Department of Education. The full fiscal year 2022 Budget Request, which was released a little over two weeks ago, makes good on President Biden's campaign commitment to reverse years of underinvestment in Federal education programs and would begin to address the significant inequities that millions of students—primarily students of color—and teachers confront every day in underserved schools across America. These inequities in opportunity and access continue to be experienced by students pursuing higher education and career and technical education credentials as well. American Rescue Plan Act Before I begin, I want to thank the Members of the Subcommittee—and your staff—who helped carry the American Rescue Plan Act to the finish line. I can tell you from immediate experience that the ARP funds will make all the difference in ensuring that schools re-open for full-time, in-person instruction as safely and soon as possible. In addition, ARP funds will enable schools to address the mental health, social, and emotional needs of students that the pandemic has laid bare, and to fully recover from the massive impact of lost instructional time on student achievement during the pandemic. The plans to reopen are bold — and will require coordination among key stakeholders at the Federal, State, and local levels. But they match the urgency the challenges before us demand. It's important to remember that once we fully reopen schools, we still have work to do. Our job will not be done. Generations of inequity have left far too many students without equitable access to high-quality, inclusive learning opportunities. Education can be the great equalizer — it was for me — if we prioritize, replicate, and invest in what works for all students, not just some. We must do more to level the playing field, including providing a strong foundation from birth, improving diversity among the teacher workforce, and creating learning pathways that work for all students. To that end, the fiscal year 2022 budget proposal for the Department of Education provides strong investments in key areas to ensure students of all ages have what they need to succeed. Department of Education Funding Levels The President's fiscal year 2022 request calls for a significant and long-overdue increase in Federal support for education from birth through college and career. The proposed discretionary request of $103 billion for Department of Education programs, an increase of almost $30 billion over the fiscal year 2021 enacted level, would be complemented by additional mandatory investments under the American Jobs Plan and the American Families Plan. We understand that some have raised questions about the unprecedented increase in Federal education funding proposed by President Biden, particularly coming on top of emergency appropriations over the past year to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our schools. However, it's important to recognize that these bold proposals follow a decade of virtually no funding growth in real terms for Department programs, a significant under-investment in light of the rising needs of students and families. The $73.5 billion that Congress appropriated for the Department for the current fiscal year, fiscal year 2021, is about 8 percent more than the fiscal year 2011 total of $68.3 billion. Title I funding did a little better, up 10 percent, or 1 percent a year, over the same period of time. The total Federal investment in elementary and secondary education grew at the same rate—just 1 percent annually over the past 10 years—not even keeping up with inflation. Funding Inequities in State and Local Education Systems This underinvestment in K-12 education matters because of the dramatic and longstanding inequities in State and local education funding systems, which despite more than half a century of litigation and reform, too often continue to provide significantly less funding for high-poverty districts and schools, which are more likely to serve students of color, resulting in a disproportionate impact on these students. Reversing these funding inequities, as well as immediately addressing the negative impact of those inequities in service of students, are critical goals of the Biden-Harris Administration's racial equity agenda, and the President's fiscal year 2022 request for the Department of Education would make a meaningful down payment toward these goals. Addressing these inequities are critical to our nation's future. Our country and our economy will be stronger when every child is prepared to succeed in tomorrow's economy, regardless of race, zip code, their family's income, or disability. Investment in Title I Grants to Local Educational Agencies The centerpiece of that request is $20 billion for a new Title I Equity Grants program—part of the President's commitment to dramatically increase funding for Title I schools—that would help address long-standing funding disparities between under-resourced school districts and their wealthier counterparts; ensure teachers in Title I schools are paid competitively; support expanded access to preschool; and increase preparation for, access to, and success in the rigorous coursework needed to prepare for postsecondary education and high-paying, in-demand careers. This proposal will further the goals of Title I as outlined by President Johnson in partnership with Congress back in 1965 as part of the War on Poverty, to help ensure that all students—especially students from low-income backgrounds and students of color in underserved communities—receive the high-quality education they need to thrive and achieve their dreams. Investment in Improving Students' Physical and Mental Health Long before the COVID-19 pandemic there was increasing evidence that the conditions of poverty—especially concentrated poverty—take a tragic toll on the physical and mental health of students. This warrants significant investments in mitigating the impact of this toll in order to improve student outcomes. Congress recognized this problem, in part, through the creation and rapid increase in funding for the Title IV-A Student Support and Academic Enrichment program. Our request would build on these efforts through a $1 billion investment for a new School-Based Health Professionals program to support the mental health needs of our students by increasing the number of counselors, nurses, and mental health professionals in our schools, and building the pipeline for these critical staff, with an emphasis on underserved schools. Community-Based Programs In addition, the President's request would help increase the availability of a broad range of wrap-around services to students and families in underserved schools and communities through a significant expansion of the Full-Service Community Schools program, from $30 million in fiscal year 2021 to $443 million in fiscal year 2022. This program recognizes the role of schools as the centers of our communities and neighborhoods, and funds efforts to identify and integrate the wide range of community-based resources needed to support students and their families, expand learning opportunities for students and parents alike, support collaborative leadership and practices, and promote the family and community engagement that can help ensure student success. The request would support implementation of the community schools model at roughly 800 additional schools serving up to 2.4 million students, family members, and community members. Our request also would help strengthen communities by fostering diverse schools through renewed efforts to improve school racial and socioeconomic diversity. We would provide $100 million for a new Fostering Diverse Schools program that would help communities develop and implement strategies that will build more racially and socioeconomically diverse schools. Research suggests that diverse learning environments benefit all students and can improve student achievement, serve as engines of social and economic mobility, and promote school improvement. Our proposal also would build evidence around effective practices for addressing the growing concern that our Nation's schools are becoming less diverse and more segregated each year. Support for Special Education We also think it is past time for the Federal Government to make good on its commitment to students with disabilities and their families, as expressed in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. The President's request makes a significant move toward full funding of the IDEA with a $2.6 billion, or 20 percent, increase for IDEA Part B Grants to States above the regular fiscal year 2021 appropriation, for a total of $15.5 billion. Notably, this increase would raise the Federal share of the excess cost of serving students with disabilities for the first time in 8 years—demonstrating that IDEA has been yet another casualty of the Federal underinvestment in education over the past 10 years. In addition, we would increase funding for the IDEA Part C Grants for the Infants and Families program by more than 50 percent, or $250 million above the regular fiscal year 2021 appropriation level, for a total of $732 million to expand access to early intervention services for infants and toddlers with disabilities. We would pair this increased funding with reforms to strengthen the Part C program, particularly for children who have been historically underrepresented in the program, including children of color. The President's Request would also boost the Preschool Grants program by $105 million over the 2021 appropriation, to aid in the provision of special education and related services for children with disabilities aged 3 through 5. Teacher Training and Support The Title I Equity Grants proposal is just one demonstration of President Biden's strong commitment to teachers. Other key investments, split between discretionary and mandatory American Families Plan funding, include $412 million ($132 million in discretionary funding and an additional $280 in mandatory authority for fiscal year 2022) for Teacher Quality Partnerships to address teaching shortages, improve training and supports for teachers, and boost teacher diversity, particularly through investment in teacher residencies and Grow Your Own programs; $340 million ($250 million in discretionary funding and an additional $90 million in mandatory authority for fiscal year 2022) for Special Education Personnel Preparation to ensure that there are adequate numbers of personnel with the skills and knowledge necessary to help children with disabilities succeed educationally; and $60 million ($20 million in discretionary funding and an additional $40 in mandatory authority for fiscal year 2022) to fund for the first time the Hawkins Centers of Excellence program designed to increase the quality and number of new teachers of color. In addition, the American Families Plan would make a one-time mandatory investment of $1.6 billion to support additional certifications at no cost for more than 100,000 educators in high-demand areas like special education, bilingual education, career and technical education, and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. We are also requesting, through the American Families Plan, $200 million in mandatory authority for a new Expanding Opportunities for Teacher Leadership and Development program to support opportunities for experienced and effective teachers to lead and have a greater impact on their school community while remaining in the classroom (and be compensated for additional responsibilities) through such activities as high-quality teacher mentorship programs and job-embedded coaching. Lastly, the American Families Plan would double TEACH Grants from $4,000 to $8,000 for future teachers while earning their degrees. Improving Career Pathways The President's Request also recognizes that a skilled workforce is critical for both strong communities and a strong economy by proposing to make targeted investments that would help build the capacity of our workforce development system. These investments include an increase of $108 million in Career and Technical Education National Programs to support an innovation grants initiative focused on youth work-based learning and industry credential attainment, along with a $25 million increase under Adult Education National Leadership Activities to expand college bridge programs for low-skilled adults without a high school degree. In addition, the American Jobs Plan would provide $1 billion in mandatory funding in fiscal year 2022 ($10 billion total over 10 years) to expand career pathways for underserved middle and high school students that include partnerships with employers, community colleges and other partners and allow students to earn credentials or college credit while still in high school; and also would invest $100 million annually over the next 10 years to help connect job-seeking adults to employment opportunities by focusing on foundational skills and embedded career services. Postsecondary Education Investments Turning to higher education, our budget proposal would make postsecondary education more affordable for students from low-income households through a $400 increase to the maximum Pell Grant. In combination with the $1,475 increase to the maximum Pell Grant proposed in the American Families Plan, the increase in 2022 would be the largest increase to the Pell Grant ever. This historic increase is just a first step in a more comprehensive proposal to double the grant. Importantly, our proposal also would ensure that postsecondary students who are DACA recipients may receive Pell Grants and other federal aid if they meet current eligibility requirements. Through the American Families Plan, our budget proposal would provide two years of free community college to first-time students and those wishing to reskill. It would also make college more affordable for low- and middle-income students at four-year Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), and Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) such as Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) and Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institutions (AANAPISIs). The fiscal year 2022 request also would increase institutional capacity and student supports at HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs, and other under-resourced institutions, such as community colleges. The discretionary request includes more than $600 million in additional funding for institutional supports programs and programs like TRIO and GEAR UP, to help ensure underserved students succeed in and graduate from college. The American Families Plan also provides historic mandatory investments over ten years in college access and success, including $46 billion for HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs, and $62 billion for a new Completion Grants program that would make formula grants to States to support the use of evidence-based strategies to strengthen completion and retention rates at institutions that serve students from our most disadvantaged communities like community colleges. School Infrastructure Too many students attend schools and child care centers that are run-down, unsafe, and pose health risks. These conditions are dangerous for our kids and exist disproportionately in schools with a high percentage of low-income students and students of color. We can't close the opportunity gap if low-income kids go to schools in buildings that undermine health and safety, while wealthier students get access to safe buildings with labs and technology that prepare them for the jobs of the future. Accordingly, the American Jobs Plan would provide $10 billion in mandatory funding in 2022, and $50 billion over five years, for grants to upgrade existing school facilities and build new public elementary and secondary schools. Outside of the Department of Education, funding would leverage an additional $50 billion in investments in school infrastructure through bonds. The American Jobs Plan would also provide $2.4 billion in mandatory funding in 2022, and $12 billion over five years, for grants to invest in community college facilities and technology in order to help protect the health and safety of students and faculty, address education deserts (particularly for rural communities), grow local economies, improve energy efficiency and resilience, and narrow funding inequities. Student Aid Administration In addition to making college more affordable, our budget proposal will improve the services we provide students and families to help them pay for college. We are requesting $2.1 billion to administer the Federal student aid programs in fiscal year 2022, an increase of $200 million over the fiscal year 2021 appropriation. The requested funds are necessary to implement the FAFSA® Simplification Act and FUTURE Act, which together will greatly ease the process of applying for student aid and accessing affordable, income-driven repayment options; provide high-quality loan servicing to more than 40 million student loan borrowers; and protect the personally identifiable information of around 75 million students and parents. Enforcement of Civil Rights Laws Finally, we would prioritize efforts to enforce the Nation's civil rights laws, as they relate to education, through a 10 percent increase for the Office for Civil Rights to protect students, providing a total of $144 million to advance equity in educational opportunity and delivery at Pre-K through 12 schools and at institutions of higher education. Closing Remarks Thank you again for this opportunity to share more about the President's plan to invest in students of all ages and the institutions that serve them. I look forward to hearing your reactions to this historic budget request, and to learning more about your individual interests and priorities related to Department of Education programs and activities. I am committed to working collaboratively with each of you, to the greatest extent possible, to help improve educational opportunities and outcomes for all students. Thank you, and I will do my best to respond to any questions you may have."

These borrowers will receive 100 percent loan discharges, resulting in approximately $500 million in relief. This brings total loan cancellation under borrower defense by the Biden-Harris Administration to $1.5 billion for approximately 90,000 borrowers. “Our action today will give thousands of borrowers a fresh start and the relief they deserve after ITT repeatedly lied to them,” said Education Secretary Miguel Cardona. “Today’s action is part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s continued commitment to stand up for borrowers when their institutions take advantage of them. Many of these borrowers have waited a long time for relief, and we need to work swiftly to render decisions for those whose claims are still pending. This work also emphasizes the need for ongoing accountability so that institutions will never be able to commit this kind of widespread deception again.” These approvals cover two categories of claims submitted by borrowers who attended ITT: their likely employment prospects and the ability to transfer credits. This is the first approval of a new category of borrower defense claims by the Department since January 2017. On employment prospects, the Department is expanding findings that it had previously made just for students who attended ITT in California to cover borrowers regardless of where they attended. ED’s review of the evidence found that ITT made repeated and significant misrepresentations to students related to how much they could expect to earn and the jobs they could obtain after graduation between 2005 and the institution’s closure in 2016. In reality, borrowers repeatedly stated that including ITT attendance on resumes made it harder for them to find employment, and their job prospects were not improved by attending ITT. Similarly, the Department found that ITT misled students about the ability to transfer their credits to other institutions from January 2007 through October 2014. The Department found that credits rarely transferred and borrowers made little to no progress along their educational journey, yet were saddled with student loan debt as a result of their time at ITT. These findings were made possible thanks to evidence provided by partners at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Iowa Office of the Attorney General, as well as Veterans Education Success. The Department looks forward to continuing to work with these organizations and others whenever schools engage in conduct that harms borrowers. The Department will begin notifying borrowers of their approvals in the coming weeks and will then work expeditiously to discharge the approximately $500 million loan balances for these borrowers. Today’s action continues efforts by the Department to provide targeted loan relief to student borrowers and ensure borrower defense and other relief programs are delivering promised assistance to borrowers. In March, the agency took action to grant $1 billion in relief to 72,000 borrowers with previously approved borrower defense claims. The Department also suspended requests for earnings documentation from borrowers who had received a total and permanent disability discharge. This action reinstated discharges for 41,000 borrowers and will help protect another 190,000 borrowers from the risk of losing their discharges. Additionally, the Department announced plans to conduct rulemaking on borrower defense, total and permanent disability discharges, and other items, starting with public hearings on June 21, 23, and 24.

14-Jun-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/department-education-updates-series-student-aid-quarterly-data-reports,Department of Education Updates Series of Student Aid Quarterly Data Reports,"Today, Federal Student Aid (FSA) released two new sets of quarterly portfolio reports on its Data Center website with key data and other information about federal student aid programs as of December 31, 2020 and March 31, 2021. ""We are committed to sharing data and information so that all Americans can better understand the value of federal student aid and how it actually works,"" said FSA Chief Richard Cordray. ""We are living through novel times, and the numbers show it. We also are spotlighting recent improvements in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, while underscoring the need for more work ahead to fulfill the original promise that Congress made to police officers, firefighters, teachers, and many others."" The reports reflect the novel flexibilities applied to borrower accounts as prescribed in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act and extended by executive actions through September 30, 2021. As a result, payments are paused, interest is waived, and collections are stopped on all Department-of-Education-held student loans as well as defaulted loans administered by guaranty agencies. FSA has also redesigned the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) report to align its reporting structure with the new application process that was recently implemented. This report highlights the need for continuing improvements to the PSLF and Temporary Expanded PSLF (TEPSLF) programs and FSA will refine and expand this document in future reports. In addition to the two new quarterly reports, FSA released updated figures for the reports on servicer performance metrics and allocations, and borrower defense to repayment. FSA posts these reports to its FSA Data Center to support open government initiatives to help ensure consistency and increase transparency. Overall Portfolio As of March 31, 2021, the outstanding federal student loan portfolio is $1.59 trillion, representing 42.9 million recipients. Of that, 90% of the outstanding balances are owned by the Department. As a result of special pandemic flexibilities for student loans, the number of borrowers in repayment status has fallen sharply. Only about 500,000 Direct Loan borrowers opted out of the payment pause and were in repayment status as of March 31, 2021, compared to 18.1 million borrowers a year ago, soon after the CARES Act was passed. More than 23 million Direct Loan borrowers with outstanding loans of about $938 billion are now in forbearance status, and more than 99% of these balances are in the special CARES Act forbearance. With almost all federal student loan borrowers now in forbearance, no new Direct Loan borrowers entered default during this quarter. The more detailed Direct Loan delinquency demographic reports have been suspended until at least December 31, 2021, the first quarter for which borrowers could potentially be delinquent. Despite the repayment pause for most borrowers, enrollment in income-driven repayment (IDR) plans has continued to grow during the pandemic. As of March 2021, 8.3 million Direct Loan borrowers were enrolled in IDR plans, up 3% from March 2020. Adding Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFEL) borrowers serviced by the Department, 8.6 million unique borrowers are enrolled in IDR plans. That is 30% of all ED-serviced borrowers or, in dollar terms, 48% of ED-serviced balances. Spotlight: *Public Service Loan Forgiveness* PSLF has recently undergone substantial changes to the application process. Over the years, PSLF has spawned much confusion and frustration. Millions of people are employed in public service, including teachers, firefighters, law enforcement, and some nonprofit workers, yet only about 5,500 borrowers have received PSLF discharges thus far, totaling $453 million. Congress has sought to simplify and streamline this relief for borrowers, which was first authorized by law more than a decade ago. One legislative measure has augmented PSLF with specific changes to qualify more borrowers, known as Temporary Expanded PSLF (TEPSLF). As a result, about 3,000 borrowers have received TEPSLF discharges totaling $130 million. FSA is currently scrutinizing PSLF to see how the promise of the original law can be better fulfilled. Today, FSA is introducing a new PSLF report that closely examines borrowers' progress toward loan forgiveness. The new report shows some encouraging signs, as almost all borrowers with a complete, processed application are receiving some credit toward ultimate forgiveness. FSA is exploring what additional data can be provided about processing times, reasons that forms are incomplete, and borrower resubmissions to further improve these reports. FSA is making other improvements as well. In November 2020, FSA released a new combined Certification and Application form that covers both PSLF and TEPSLF. Borrowers previously had to submit separate forms to certify their employment or to apply for forgiveness. Since the new form was implemented (through April 2021), FSA has received more than 391,000 applications from approximately 322,000 borrowers. Of these, more than 168,000 have been completed and processed, 146,000 remain in processing, and 76,600 were missing necessary information. Almost all (99.7%) of the 168,000 completed and processed applications came from borrowers whose loans and employment meet the legal requirements to receive credit toward PSLF, though the vast majority of applicants have not been in repayment on a qualifying loan long enough to meet the required ten years (120 months) of qualifying employment or qualifying payments. Cumulatively, 1.25 million borrowers have had their employment eligibility certified and have received a qualifying payment count so they can keep track of where they stand on attaining PSLF. The qualifying payment counts for these borrowers are pegged as of their last employment certification or combined form submission. Since borrowers do not formally enroll or un-enroll in PSLF or TEPSLF, FSA does not know how many of them still plan to pursue forgiveness on this basis, but those that do plan to do so will continue to make steady progress during the pause in current repayments as these months can count toward PSLF or TEPSLF, as long as the borrower's employment continues to qualify. FSA will include information about these borrowers' further progress toward forgiveness in its future data reports. The new PSLF report provides greater insight into why many borrowers are not meeting the forgiveness requirements. For most borrowers, it is simply a matter of timing. Over 82% of borrowers who do not yet qualify for forgiveness have eligible loans that have been in repayment less than 120 months, meaning they could not yet have accumulated the required 120 months of qualifying employment or qualifying payments. One notable problem here relates to borrowers who consolidated older federal student loans into new Direct Loans and then were made to start over on a brand-new clock; they did not get credit for employment or payment activity on their prior loans. This issue merits further consideration. In the meantime, however, close to half the borrowers who do not yet qualify for PSLF on this basis are held back by this treatment of their consolidated loans. The remaining 18% of borrowers who do not yet qualify for forgiveness divide as follows: 14% do not yet have 120 months of qualifying employment; 4% have met all requirements except for 120 qualifying payments.

14-Jun-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-posts-state-plans-use-american-rescue-plan-funds-support-students-and-safe-and-sustained-reopening-schools,U.S. Department of Education Posts State Plans for Use of American Rescue Plan Funds to Support Students and the Safe and Sustained Reopening of Schools,"Today, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) posted 28 plans submitted by State Education Agencies (SEAs) describing how states plan to use American Rescue Plan Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ARP ESSER) funds to support schools, students and educators. The ARP ESSER Fund provides nearly $122 billion to states to support the nation’s schools in safely reopening and sustaining safe in-person operations while meeting the social, emotional, mental health and academic needs of students impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The release of the submitted plans comes shortly after new data published by the Institute of Education Sciences found that, in April, 59% of K-8 schools were offering in-person instruction full time, up from 46% since the beginning of the Biden-Harris Administration. “We’re thrilled to see that states are directing the unprecedented resources from the American Rescue Plan toward addressing student needs and quickly and safely reopening our schools, so we can give every student the opportunity to learn full-time, in-person,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “These state plans make clear that the American Rescue Plan is providing much-needed support to states and districts as they work to not only bring students back to in-person learning, but also to address inequities made worse by the pandemic and make sure every student has the social, emotional, and mental health support they need to create a strong foundation for academic success.” In April, states received access to two-thirds of their ARP ESSER allocation—a total of $81 billion. The remaining $41 billion will become available following the Department’s approval of each state’s plan. Every plan will be reviewed by the Department to determine whether it addresses published requirements, including seeking input from key stakeholder groups and the public in the development of the plan, and addressing the needs of students disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including students in underserved communities. The Department will work with each state to revise its plan, as necessary, to meet all requirements so that the Department can expeditiously release the remaining funds. While these reviews are ongoing, the Department’s decision to post submitted plans online will make it possible for the public—including families, educators, and community-based organizations—to learn more about how states are planning to use ARP ESSER funds. The Department also will post all approved state plans. The 28 plans include examples of how ARP ESSER funds will provide critical support to schools and communities for safe school reopening and operating efforts, and to meet the needs of students disproportionately impacted by the pandemic, including by addressing underlying inequities in access and opportunity for underserved students. Highlights from the plans include: Accelerating and sustaining the safe return to in-person instruction: It is the Department’s expectation that all states and schools will provide every student the opportunity to return to in-person instruction full-time this fall. For example, New Jersey will provide state-level support for school nurses and other school health staff in understanding and implementing health and safety strategies for the return to in-person instruction. Tennessee released a template for school districts to develop health and safety plans as they work to bring more students back to in-person instruction and developed a data dashboard on school operating status that it plans to continue to share publicly in the fall. Implementing COVID-19 prevention and mitigation strategies, including expanding access to vaccinations for school staff and students: All plans described how states are supporting their districts in prioritizing the safety of their students, educators, and staff, including by implementing prevention policies in line with the most up-to-date guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Nine states detailed plans to prioritize vaccinations for educators and students. For example, Ohio is encouraging schools to offer eligible students the opportunity to get vaccinated during their extended or summer learning programming and into the fall. In addition, Arkansas is encouraging school districts to hold on-site vaccination clinics for students and to provide excused absences for students who miss class because they are getting vaccinated. ARP ESSER funds may be used by districts in these efforts. Offering summer learning and enrichment programs: States are required to describe programs to expand summer learning and enrichment opportunities for students, and many of the plans specifically indicate that they will focus summer learning opportunities on students who have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. For example, New Mexico is setting up a $6 million joint program with local municipalities to provide summer internships for middle and high school students, using research on best practices for work-based learning. Massachusetts will offer summer school matching grants for school districts to offer four- to six-week, in-person summer programs that include mental health services and additional supports for students with disabilities and multilingual learners. Kansas will reserve a portion of funds for an initiative that will offset the cost of admission for students to visit museums, zoos, historical sites, state parks, and the Kansas state fair. Providing social, emotional, and mental health support to students: All states described plans to expand social, emotional, and mental health supports for students. These critical supports will ensure more students—particularly those in communities disproportionately impacted by the pandemic—have access to counselors and mental health services to address the traumas students have faced over the last year and create a strong foundation for academic success. For example, Oklahoma is using approximately $35 million for districts to hire new school counselors, licensed mental health professionals and licensed recreational therapists to lower the student-to-counselor ratio. The District of Columbia, in partnership with its Department of Behavioral Health, is further expanding its Comprehensive School-Based Behavioral Health System to provide more students with access to clinical services in public schools. Addressing the academic impact of lost instructional time: An important element of the ARP ESSER state plans is the description of evidence-based interventions that address the academic impact of lost instructional time by addressing students’ social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs—particularly for student populations most impacted by the pandemic. For example, Arkansas’ Tutoring Corps program will create a system to recruit, prepare, and support candidates to become qualified tutors to support the students most impacted by lost instructional time. Massachusetts will use federal funding to provide early literacy tutoring grants and a K-8 Math Acceleration program. Montana is planning to use ARP ESSER funding to provide additional professional development for educators who serve in districts with significant populations of American Indian students to facilitate culturally responsive instruction to addressinequities exacerbated by the pandemic. Kentucky is planning to support its schools and districts in creating acceleration plans that provide students with more time and dedicated attention, and that focus on immersing students in grade-level standards. And West Virginia will be offering students with disabilities extended year services in conjunction with summer programming, so students can participate in both sets of programs. ARP ESSER state plans were submitted by the June 7 deadline by Arkansas, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Georgia, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Washington, West Virginia, and Wyoming. The Department is working closely with remaining states that did not submit by the deadline, the vast majority of which were due to state board of education or legislative review requirements. The rigorous and prompt review of these state plans is part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s broader efforts to help schools quickly and safely reopen for in-person instruction, sustain their safe operations, and support educators and other school staff as they meet all students’ social, emotional, mental health and academic needs. In addition to providing $122 billion to support the safe and continued reopening of K-12 schools in the ARP ESSER Fund, the Administration also has: Released Volume 1 , Volume 2 , and Volume 3 of the COVID-19 Handbook Released guidance on Maintenance of Effort and Maintenance of Equity requirements and worked with states to ensure that they fulfill these important responsibilities as they use federal funds, Held a National Safe School Reopening Summit , Launched the Safer Schools and Campuses Best Practices Clearinghouse , Called on states to prioritize vaccinations for educators and eligible students, and Provided $10 billion in funding for COVID-19 testing for PreK-12 educators, staff, and students. Also, later this month, the Department will launch an Equity Summit Series to help more states and schools address inequities exacerbated by the pandemic and ensure every student feels safe, supported, and set up for success in their classroom."

10-Jun-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/statement-us-secretary-education-miguel-cardona-results-april-2021-naep-survey-school-reopening,Statement from U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona on Results of April 2021 NAEP Survey on School Reopening,"“Today's data reaffirms what we’ve been seeing and hearing for months – that we’ve met and exceeded President Biden’s goal of reopening the majority of K-8 schools, and that as a nation we continue to make significant progress in reopening as many schools as possible before the summer. As of April, 96 percent of K-8 schools were offering in-person learning options and 59 percent of these schools were offering full-time in-person instruction. From speaking with educators, students, parents, and districts across the country, we know that additional reopening progress was made in May and the early weeks of June. While today’s data show that for the first time this year more Black and Hispanic fourth graders were attending school in-person full-time in April than attending fully remote, we have more work to do to ensure that Black, Hispanic, and Asian students have equal access to in-person learning options as their white peers, and that parents and students feel confident again learning inside school buildings. “Schools have shown that they can - and should - be offering in-person learning opportunities five days a week to every student. With increased access to vaccinations and testing, unprecedented funding from the American Rescue Plan, and resources like our COVID Handbooks and Best Practices Clearinghouse, it is my expectation that all schools will offer full time in person learning to every student this fall. The Department will continue to work with schools and districts over the coming months to provide more students access to summer learning opportunities to reengage and prepare them for the 2021 school year, and ensure every student can learn and thrive five days a week inside their classrooms this fall.”"
9-Jun-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/department-education-announces-actions-advance-equity-education,Department of Education Announces Actions to Advance Equity in Education,"Today, building on the American Rescue Plan’s historic funding for schools as drivers of equity and opportunity, the Department of Education announced a series of actions it is taking to advance equity in education and ensure schools across the nation are serving all students. Actions include the release of a report highlighting the disparate impacts of COVID-19 on K-12 and postsecondary students in underserved communities, the release of guidance to implement an historic provision within the American Rescue Plan that will ensure that the school districts with the highest poverty do not receive any per-pupil decrease in state funding below their pre-pandemic levels, and an Equity Summit Series the Department will be holding over the coming months. The actions aim to not only address inequities exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, but encourage schools more broadly to reimagine their education systems and practices and infuse equity into all of their work, so that every student has access to rigorous, culturally responsive, and fulfilling instruction. Today’s announcements are part of the Department’s ongoing efforts to implement President Biden’s Day One Executive Order to advance racial equity and support for underserved communities across the federal government and build our schools and communities back better than before the pandemic. “This is our moment as educators and as leaders to transform our education systems so they are truly serving all of our nation’s students,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “While COVID-19 has worsened many inequities in our schools and communities, we know that even before the pandemic, a high-quality education was out of reach for too many of our nation’s students and families. Our mission at the Department is to safely reopen schools for in-person learning, dramatically increase investments in communities that for too long have been furthest from opportunity, and reimagine our schools so that all students have their needs met. We must take bold action together to ensure our nation’s schools are defined not by disparities, but by equity and opportunity for all.” The actions include: The Department will launch an Equity Summit Series beginning on June 22nd The Educational Equity Summit Series will launch virtually with the first event on June 22nd and will focus on how, as schools and campuses continue to reopen and welcome students back for in-person instruction, they must not return to the status quo. The first installment of the series will explore how schools and communities can reimagine our school systems so that every student has a voice in their school and classroom, particularly students from underserved communities, including communities of color, students with disabilities, and multilingual learners. The event will also feature discussions on how all students can access a high-quality education responsive to their needs, and how schools can create more culturally and linguistically responsive and inclusive learning environments for all students. The first installment will feature remarks from Department leaders, panel discussions focused on evidence-based practices and promising strategies for building equitable and inclusive environments in our schools, and insights from leaders working to make equitable and inclusive schools a reality. Participants include Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona, Deputy Secretary of Education Cindy Marten, Dean of the University of Southern California Rossier School of Education Pedro Noguera, 2021 School Counselor of the Year Olivia Carter, and others. Interested participants can register to attend the Summit here . Information about additional installments in the series will be announced later this summer. The Department released a new report highlighting the disparate impacts COVID-19 has had on underserved communities The Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights released a new report today responding to the President’s Executive Order on Supporting the Reopening and Continuing Operation of Schools and Early Childhood Education Providers. The report highlights how COVID-19 threatens to deepen divides in educational opportunity across our nation’s classrooms and campuses if the pandemic’s disparate impacts are not adequately addressed. The report explores how the impacts of the pandemic are falling disproportionately on students who went into the pandemic with the fewest educational opportunities, many of whom are from marginalized and underserved communities. Observations from the report include impacts of the pandemic on both K-12 and postsecondary education students, including how COVID-19 has deepened pre-pandemic disparities in access and opportunities facing students of color, multilingual learners, students with disabilities, and LGBTQ+ students, with significant impacts on their learning. The report also discusses how many students have lost access to mental health services during the pandemic, with early research showing disparities in negative mental-health impacts based on students’ race, ethnicity, LGBTQ+ identity, and other factors. Additionally, the report includes data discussing how the pandemic has caused heightened risk of harassment, discrimination, and other harms for Asian American and Pacific Islander students, and recognizes that the pandemic may have put students at heightened risk of sexual harassment, abuse and violence - particularly girls, women, and students who are transgender, non-binary, or gender non-conforming. The Department is fully committed to confronting these impacts, which threaten to affect students’ access to educational opportunities, particularly those who already face unequal access to quality education prior to the pandemic. The Educational Equity Summit Series will aim to identify evidence-based practices and promising strategies to address these disparities and explore ways states, schools, and communities can invest the unprecedented resources provided by the American Rescue Plan and proposed in President Biden’s budget, the American Jobs Plan, and the American Families Plan to help close these gaps and support underserved students. The Department released new guidance to support states as they invest American Rescue Plan funds in communities and schools with the least access to educational opportunity Many students in underserved communities are facing multiple traumas as a result of the pandemic, and our states and districts must be responsive by targeting resources in schools and communities with the fewest resources. Last month, the Department released guidance on how states and school districts can use American Rescue Plan Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) funds and other pandemic recovery funds to advance educational equity in COVID-19 response. The guidance includes specific ways that schools can address the social, emotional, mental health, and academic impact of lost instructional time and support multilingual learners, students with disabilities, students experiencing homelessness, children and youth in foster care, migratory students, and other underserved students. Today, the Department released its Maintenance of Equity guidance to implement an important provision of the American Rescue Plan as the nation continues to respond to the impact of COVID-19. For the first time ever, these requirements will ensure that school districts and schools serving a large share of students from low-income backgrounds will not experience disproportionate budget cuts—and that the school districts with the highest poverty do not receive any decrease in state per-pupil funding below their pre-pandemic level. In addition, high-poverty schools will also be protected from disproportionate cuts to staffing. These provisions are critically important, as schools and school districts serving the greatest shares of students from low-income backgrounds have historically been under-funded and are more reliant on state funding than schools and school districts with lower concentrations of underserved students. President Biden’s budget proposes historic investments in Title I to address entrenched disparities in education systems In addition to the historic resources the American Rescue Plan is providing states to address inequities made worse by the pandemic, President Biden’s fiscal year 2022 budget proposes $36.5 billion in formula grants for Title I schools, a $20 billion increase from the 2021 enacted level. This investment will enable states and communities to reinvest in historically under-resourced schools and reimagine their education systems so all students can access high-quality education and have the support they need to succeed. The investment will provide meaningful incentives for states to examine and address inequities in school funding systems, as well as ensure teachers at Title I schools are paid competitively, provide equitable access to rigorous coursework, and increase access to high-quality preschool. States would be required to collect and report data analyzing gaps in these key foundational areas, and work with their districts to make plans to address them. As we look beyond recovery from the pandemic, we must ensure resources and support are reaching communities that have been most under-resourced, and this historic proposal will help make more equitable schools a reality for more students. For additional detail on this proposal, including the need for urgent action in these areas, please see the President’s FY 2022 Budget request."

The Department worked with public health officials and partners across the Biden-Harris Administration to ensure that the Handbook provides actionable strategies IHEs can use to implement CDC guidance to prevent and mitigate the spread of COVID-19. The Handbook also provides strategies on how higher education institutions can utilize funds from the American Rescue Plan (ARP) and previous relief bills to meet the needs of all students, boost vaccination rates on campus, and address inequities exacerbated by the pandemic, among other topics covered. ""Many of our nation's postsecondary students have experienced the toughest year in their educational careers,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""We must deploy every resource to bear to make sure all higher education students can reengage with their school communities, continue their education, and graduate ready to pursue their dreams. With the American Rescue Plan and key resources like Volume 3 of the COVID-19 Handbook, institutions of higher education will be able to not only protect the safety of students, educators, and staff, but also support those students who have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic."" Today's release is part of the Administration's broader effort to provide schools and communities with the resources and support they need to return to in-person learning safely and quickly. Volume 3 of the COVID-19 Handbook addresses several priority areas of interest to the higher education community, with an eye towards both a response and a recovery that leaves our nation's students and institutions of higher education stronger than before the pandemic began. Areas include: Providing practices to aid IHEs in implementing CDC guidance , such as ways to offer and promote the COVID-19 vaccination, and mitigation strategies to pursue for campuses where everyone is fully vaccinated, as well as campuses where not everyone is fully vaccinated. The Handbook also identifies common prevention strategies and provides examples of actions IHEs can take with Higher Education Emergency Relief (HEERF) grant funding from the three relief bills to pursue these efforts; Describing the ways in which IHEs have responded to the ongoing challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic—particularly challenges faced by underserved student populations—by supporting students' transition to online learning and addressing basic needs such as broadband access, financial assistance, housing, and childcare; Noting ways in which IHEs have already been and can continue to be sources of support to their communities' ongoing response and recovery from the pandemic— including in vaccination efforts; and Providing a catalog of the resources and administrative flexibilities offered to IHEs as they address rapidly changing conditions and needs on the ground, including resources that support both students and IHEs under the ARP. Volume 3 of the Handbook incorporated feedback from IHEs and over 40 organizations representing stakeholders and institutions across 15 listening sessions, and was developed in response to some of the most pressing questions the Department heard from colleges, students, families, educators, and others impacted by the pandemic. The Handbook incorporates a diversity of perspectives, experiences, and challenges facing our nation's postsecondary students, ranging from the full-time, on-campus recent high school graduate; to the older returning student seeking re-training through online, part-time programming while balancing work and parenting duties; to the middle-aged immigrant seeking English language skills, job training, and a high school equivalency with on-ramps into postsecondary education. Under the ARP, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES), and the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act (CRRSAA), approximately $76 billion in Higher Education Emergency Relief Funding (HEERF) has been made available to IHEs to support students and IHEs impacted by the pandemic. Earlier this year, the Department of Education released Volume 1 and Volume 2 of the COVID-19 Handbook, both of which focused on strategies to support the safe reopening of K-12 schools and address the impacts of COVID-19 on K-12 students, educators, and communities. The Department also launched the ""Safer Schools and Campuses Best Practices Clearinghouse,"" which highlights lessons learned and best practices that can help IHEs identify opportunities to best use ARP and other relief funds to support students, faculty, and staff impacted by the pandemic, particularly those in underserved communities and those hardest hit by the pandemic. The Clearinghouse also provides resources and guidance for institutions as they work to reengage with students who have temporarily opted out of postsecondary education."

This information will assist OCR in determining what policy guidance, technical assistance, or other resources may help schools improve school climate and safety, and ensure equal access to education programs and activities, consistent with the civil rights laws that OCR enforces. ""All students deserve access to safe, supportive schools and classrooms. Discrimination and use of exclusionary discipline can negatively impact students' abilities to learn, grow and thrive,"" said Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""We're seeking information so that the Department can help schools and educators confront disparities and create inclusive school environments that set all students up for success."" OCR's Civil Rights Data Collection has shown persistent disparities over time in the use of exclusionary discipline. The data from the 2017-18 school year survey show, for example, that Black students represented 15 percent of student enrollment but 38 percent of students who received one or more out-of-school suspensions, and students with disabilities represented 13 percent of student enrollment but 25 percent of students who received one or more out-of-school suspensions. ""Our nation's civil rights laws require fair and nondiscriminatory school discipline practices,"" said Acting Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Suzanne B. Goldberg, ""yet we have data that show concerning disparities based on race, sex, and disability in the administration of discipline. We want to hear from educators, students, parents, and other stakeholders about how the Department can support schools in addressing disparities and eliminating discrimination in school discipline and fostering positive and inclusive school climates."" Today's Request for Information continues OCR's broad and sustained effort to promote fair and nondiscriminatory school discipline and to support the development of safe and inclusive school climates. Last month, OCR and the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division hosted a virtual convening, "" Brown 67 Years Later: Examining Disparities in School Discipline and the Pursuit of Safe and Inclusive Schools,"" a discussion about strategies for addressing disparities in the administration of school discipline. Both the convening and today's actions are steps to carry out the Biden-Harris administration's commitment to equity, set out in President Biden's Executive Order on Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government."
3-Jun-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-administration-launches-covid-19-college-challenge-get-more-young-people-vaccinated,Biden Administration Launches COVID-19 College Challenge to Get More Young People Vaccinated,"Today, the Department of Education announced more details on the COVID-19 College Challenge, where colleges and universities take a pledge and commit to taking action to get their college communities vaccinated. The COVID-19 College Challenge is part of the Biden Administration's month of action in June encouraging Americans to get vaccinated and aims to accelerate our national progress toward President Biden's goal of 70% of the U.S. adult population receiving at least one vaccine shot by July 4th. First Lady Jill Biden and Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona kicked off the challenge on their social media platforms, encouraging institutions of higher education to join the challenge. The Challenge will galvanize colleges to reach young people where they are, with information they can use, through trusted messengers they rely on, and provide them opportunities and access to vaccination. Especially over the summer when many students are away from campus, it is important that college leaders and student leaders make a plan to reach every member of their campus community—student, faculty, and staff – to encourage them to get vaccinated now. ""The College Vaccine Challenge is a terrific way for all postsecondary institutions to engage students, faculty, and staff in an effort to keep their communities safe,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""I encourage every college and university to take this pledge and get creative in becoming Vaccine Champion Colleges. We must all work together to beat this pandemic and put the focus back on students' educational careers that will put them on the path to success."" Colleges around the country have been leading the way throughout the pandemic to keep their communities safe and healthy—including efforts to get students vaccinated this past spring. College presidents can now take the pledge to become a Vaccine Champion College, committing to taking the following actions: Engage every student, faculty, and staff member: Make sure every member of your campus community knows they are eligible for vaccine and has resources to find one. For example, colleges can: Make an Ask: Encourage every student, staff, faculty, and member of your college community to make a plan and get vaccinated now. Educate : Provide information and resources to all students and staff/faculty (virtually and in-person) on safety and availability of the vaccine—in language that young people understand. Organize your college community: Lead the way by identifying champions for vaccine efforts across campus and implementing a plan to get as many members of your college community vaccinated as possible. For example, colleges can: Host A Meeting: Convene a meeting of student, faculty, and staff leaders from across the college community to build a college-wide plan to get as many people vaccinated as possible this summer. Enlist student and staff/faculty leaders: Designate key leaders among students and staff/faculty to drive peer-to-peer engagement and education efforts and to serve as resources for the community. Speak Up : College administrators and student leaders can use their voices on social media, in school and community newspapers, and anywhere they can about how vaccination brings us back to the campus life we know and love. Deliver vaccine access for all: Meet your community where it is; bring vaccines on-site, and make it easier for students, staff, and faculty to get vaccinated sites nearby them this summer. For example, colleges can: Make it easier for everyone to get vaccinated: Offer vaccine clinics on campus, or partner with nearby providers. For students and staff not on campus, walk them through process to schedule a vaccine appointment nearby them and make a plan to complete it. Offer paid time off for employees to get vaccinated. Set goals and track success: Hold yourself accountable by setting goals, tracking success, and using data to know and understand your reach. Any college or university can commit to the Challenge by going to whitehouse.gov/COVIDCollegeChallenge and signing up. Signing up means that a college has committed to taking action, and their institution will be listed on the White House website as taking the pledge and committing to action. The Administration will provide resources to assist colleges and universities in their vaccination efforts, including toolkits and materials for communicating with staff and students about the vaccine and tips for how to drive success. We will encourage all Vaccine Champion Colleges to voluntarily share out their progress via social media with #COVIDCollegeChallenge and #WeCanDoThis. As part of the College Vaccine Challenge, the Administration will also be taking a series of actions to support institutions of higher education as they work to get their students, educators, and communities vaccinated, including: Launching new student focus within the COVID-19 Community Corps: The Administration will work with stakeholders to generate educational materials on the vaccine that can best reach young people. As part of this effort, the Administration will host regular training sessions for college and student leaders to organize their colleges, peers, and communities, under the umbrella of the COVID Community Corps. This new strand of the Community Corps work will focus on training up young people and youth/student organizations to become vaccine champions in their communities. Training will focus on getting friends and family vaccinated; working with civic, campus, and community leaders on drawing young people out to get vaccinated; designing and creating engaging content for young people to learn about the vaccine; and hosting community education events to build confidence in the vaccine. As part of the effort, the Administration will also be engaging educators to encourage their students and peers to get vaccinated and spread the word about the challenge. Building on efforts to provide vaccine access at community colleges : Earlier this month, President Biden announced that as part of ongoing efforts to reach students to get vaccinated, the Administration will launch partnerships between federal retail pharmacy partners and high-enrollment community colleges to provide on-site clinics for students, staff, and local communities. These community colleges will work to get word out to students, staff, and local communities to make use of these clinics, especially for students who are on or nearby campus this summer. The program builds on the strong success of the federal pharmacy program in reaching local communities, including through over 6,000 mobile vaccination clinics across the program to date. Community colleges are key anchors in our communities, with significant reach into the geographies they serve, and a great diversity of students enrolled. To date, 60 community colleges from 20 states have signed up for this initiative. The full list of colleges that have signed up can be found here ."

The following agencies were approved for renewal of recognition for five years: American Board of Funeral Services Education, Committee on Accreditation Association of Institutions of Jewish Studies American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, Council on Academic Accreditation in Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology Council on Naturopathic Medical Education Midwifery Education Accreditation Council Montessori Accreditation Council on Teacher Education National Accrediting Commission of Career Arts and Sciences, Inc. ""The SDO also notified the Commission on Massage Therapy Accreditation that within 12 months, it must come into compliance with the specific criteria outlined in the SDO's letter and submit a compliance report demonstrating the agency's compliance. If recognition is renewed following a decision on the compliance report, the period of recognition will not exceed five years from the date of today's SDO decision. Withdrawal of Recognition of the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools ""The SDO agreed with the recommendations of ED's accreditation staff and the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity (NACIQI) – an independent federal advisory committee – to withdraw recognition of the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools (ACICS). Accreditors are entrusted with assuring institutional quality and acting as gatekeepers to federal student aid. This oversight helps ensure that institutions deliver on the promises made to students and safeguard federal resources. In its February 2021 final staff report, accreditation staff found that ACICS failed to comply with federal recognition criteria including monitoring of compliance of institutions and inadequate administrative capability. Such breaches in compliance, as determined by agency staff and NACIQI, warrant withdrawal of federal recognition."""
28-May-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/statement-secretary-education-miguel-cardona-presidents-fiscal-year-2022-budget,Statement by Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona on the President's Fiscal Year 2022 Budget,"The Biden-Harris Administration today submitted to Congress the President's budget for fiscal year 2022 . As the Administration continues to make progress defeating the pandemic and getting our economy back on track, the budget makes historic investments that will help the country build back better and lay the foundation for shared growth and prosperity for decades to come. ""This proposal reflects the Biden-Harris Administration's commitment to ensuring that student success remains at the heart of the Department of Education's work. It calls on Congress to prioritize the physical and mental health of students and close education equity gaps, especially in underserved communities,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""We need to focus on not only recovering from the pandemic but also look towards our students' education after the pandemic to ensure there are improved resources to build our education system back better than before. This budget ensures all students have access to high-quality, affordable postsecondary education, while also improving career pathways for students of all ages and levels."" The budget includes the two historic plans the President has already put forward — the American Jobs Plan and the American Families Plan – and reinvests in education, research, public health, and other foundations of our country's strength. At the Department of Education (ED), the budget would: Add at Least Four Years of Free Education. The American Families Plan will make transformational investments from early childhood to postsecondary education so that all children and young people are able to grow, learn, and gain the skills they need to succeed. It will provide universal, high-quality preschool to all three- and four-year-olds, led by a well-trained and well-compensated workforce. It will provide two years of free community college and invest in making college more affordable for low- and middle-income students, including students at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), and minority-serving institutions (MSIs) such as Hispanic-serving institutions and Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-serving institutions. And, it will invest in our teachers as well as our students, improving teacher training and support so that our schools become engines of growth at every level. Make Historic Investments in High Poverty Schools. Addressing entrenched disparities in education is both a moral and economic imperative. The budget proposes a historic $36.5 billion investment in grants for Title I schools, a $20 billion increase from the 2021 enacted level. This investment would provide historically under-resourced schools with the funding needed to deliver a high-quality education to all of their students, as well as meaningful incentives for states to examine and address inequities in school funding systems. These additional funds will advance the President's commitment to ensure teachers at Title I schools are paid competitively, provide equitable access to rigorous coursework, and increase access to high-quality preschool. Prioritize the Physical and Mental Well-Being of Students. Recognizing the profound effect of physical and mental health on academic achievement, the budget provides $1 billion, in addition to the resources in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, to increase the number of counselors, school psychologists, nurses, and social workers in schools. In addition, it provides $443 million for Full Service Community Schools, which play a critical role in providing comprehensive wrap-around services to students and their families, from afterschool, to adult education opportunities, and health and nutrition services. Boost Support for Children with Disabilities. The budget includes $16 billion, a historic increase of $2.7 billion over 2021 enacted, for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) to support special education and related services for more than 7.6 million Pre-K through 12 students. This is a significant first step toward fully funding IDEA and supports providing a high-quality education to children with disabilities. The budget also provides $732 million for early intervention services for infants and toddlers with disabilities, funding services that have a proven record of improving academic and developmental outcomes. The $250 million increase would be paired with reforms to expand access to these services for underserved children, including children of color and children from low-income families. Enacting the budget policies into law this year would strengthen our nation's economy and lay the foundation for shared prosperity, while also improving our nation's long-term fiscal health.

26-May-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/secretary-cardona-holds-virtual-roundtable-discuss-importance-providing-pell-grants-incarcerated-individuals,Secretary Cardona Holds Virtual Roundtable to Discuss the Importance of Providing Pell Grants for Incarcerated Individuals,"This afternoon, Education Secretary Miguel Cardona held a virtual roundtable to showcase the importance of providing Pell Grants for incarcerated individuals by speaking with students and former students who took college courses in prison. This session allowed the Secretary to hear directly from students who have gone through college in prison programs and provided insight on how we can best serve these students going forward. Secretary Cardona launched the discussion and listened as the students shared their stories. “I am so glad to be here to talk with you today and thank each of you for your willingness to share your stories with me. College in prison programs have an important mission that I strongly believe in. I know how important teachers and professors are and the effect they have in all our life trajectories – and I want more incarcerated adults to have access to high-quality educational programs while they’re in prison.” One by one the formerly incarcerated students shared their stories of education triumph, as well as the many challenges they faced trying to meet their educational goals. Daniela Medina, from California, said she dropped out of high school and eventually was incarcerated. During her incarceration, she said she earned her GED, which led to her thirst for education and the longing to bringing something positive back to her family once she got out of prison. “Three years before I got paroled, Feather River College in Quincy, California, came into the prison and said they were only accepting 60 students out of the 3,000 women who were incarcerated. I was very fortunate to be one of the chosen,” Medina said. Medina said that having the opportunity to pursue an education while incarcerated filled her with confidence and changed her perspective about herself. “I no longer felt like I was just incarcerated or an incarcerated person,” she said. “I felt like I was a scholar and part of the student body on a college campus.” Medina graduated magna cum laude with a BASW from UC Berkeley in 2019. She recently graduated with her master’s in social work from UC Berkeley and was awarded the 2021 Social Welfare Dean’s Award for Social Justice. All the students overwhelmingly agreed that more resources are needed to help bond colleges with prisons so more incarcerated individuals have access to quality education. Cardona closed the roundtable reaffirming his commitment to providing Pell Grants for incarcerated students. “I am inspired by what I've heard today about the importance of this issue and the continued need for access to Pell for incarcerated students. I am committed to ensuring that the Department works to serve currently- and formerly incarcerated students well, and to increasing access to high-quality post-secondary education for these students.” The U.S. Department of Education (ED) is currently running the Second Chance Pell Experiment that allows about 100 colleges to offer Pell Grants to incarcerated individuals. In the coming years, ED will be implementing a change Congress made in December 2020 that removes a legislative ban that prevented incarcerated students outside the experiment from receiving access to this aid. The Biden administration has proposed historic investments in our education system, including increasing the maximum Federal Pell Grant by $1400."

These issues include borrower defense to repayment for students harmed by their colleges’ misleading practices and gainful employment requirements to protect students and taxpayers from poor-performing programs. They also include loan repayment and improving the rules governing targeted student loan cancellation authorities for borrowers engaged in public service, with disabilities, or whose institutions close, among other topics. This process of issuing new regulations reflects the Department’s commitment to serving students and borrowers well and protecting them from harmful programs and practices that may derail their postsecondary and career goals. “The Department of Education’s primary responsibility is to serve students and borrowers,” said Education Secretary Miguel Cardona. “That means taking a fresh look at a range of regulations to make sure they are not creating unnecessary barriers, but instead can ensure that institutions and programs serve our students well.” The Department is interested in comments on regulations that would address gaps in postsecondary outcomes, such as retention, completion, student loan repayment, and loan default. Specific consideration to disparate impacts by income, race/ethnicity, gender, and other demographic characteristics is encouraged. Today’s announcement is the first step in the process of issuing new regulations. Following the public hearings, the Department will solicit nominations for non-federal negotiators who can serve on the negotiated rulemaking committees, which will convene in late summer 2021. The Department suggests the following topics for regulation in the hearing notice but invites comment on any regulatory issue that that can improve outcomes for students, especially borrowers. Potential topics may include: Ability to benefit Borrower defense to repayment Certification procedures for participation in federal financial aid programs Change of ownership and change in control of institutions of higher education Closed school discharges Discharges for borrowers with a total and permanent disability Discharges for false certification of student eligibility Financial responsibility for participating institutions of higher education, such as events that indicate heightened financial risk Gainful employment Income-contingent loan repayment plans Mandatory pre-dispute arbitration and prohibition of class action lawsuits provisions in institutions’ enrollment agreements/li> Pell Grant eligibility for prison education programs Public service loan forgiveness Standards of administrative capability The Department is aware of likely stakeholder interest in regulations in response to the Fiscal Year 2020 appropriations bill, which made changes to the 90/10 rule to require that private for-profit institutions derive at least 10 percent of their revenue from non-federal sources like the Department’s federal financial aid programs and benefits for veterans and military servicemembers. By law, the Department may not begin regulatory activity on this provision until October 1, 2021. The hearings will be held from 10:00 AM – 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM – 4:00 PM (EST) on June 21, 23, and 24. Individuals who would like to make comments at the public hearings must register by sending an email message to negreghearing@ed.gov no later than 12:00 PM (EST) on the business day prior to the public hearing at which they wish to speak. The message should include the name and email address of the speaker, the general topic(s) to be addressed, and at least two dates and times during which the individual would be available to speak. The Department will attempt to accommodate each speaker’s scheduling preference; however, if we are unable to do so, determinations will be made on a first- come first-served basis, based on the registration submission time and date. Participant’s comments will be limited to three-to-five minutes. Individuals who wish to view the hearings without providing comment must register for each day they wish to observe.

18-May-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/washington-states-melito-ramirez-named-americas-first-recognizing-inspiring-school-employees-rise-awardee,Washington State's Melito Ramirez Named America's First ‘Recognizing Inspiring School Employees (RISE)’ Awardee,"U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona announced today the selection of Melito Ramirez, an intervention specialist at Walla Walla High School in Washington state, as the nation's first Recognizing Inspiring School Employees ( RISE ) awardee. This new honor, established by Congress in 2019, spotlights classified school employees' outstanding contributions to quality K-12 education in the United States. Classified school employees include paraprofessionals, clerical and administrative services, transportation services, food and nutrition services, custodial and maintenance services, security services, health and student services, technical services, and skilled trades professionals. They offer essential services to the school community and play a vital role in providing for the welfare, safety, and success of students. ""I'm pleased to recognize Mr. Ramirez as a most deserving employee who has demonstrated courage and creativity every day over decades of service as he inspires students in Washington State,"" U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona said. ""Education support professionals' work too often goes unrecognized. However, especially in this pandemic year, they have made some of the most extraordinary contributions to keep our communities safe and support our students and schools. I'm honored to recognize them for the heroes that they are."" Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington said, ""I congratulate Mr. Ramirez for being the classified staff of the year. This honor recognizes his commitment to supporting students at Walla Walla High School. In his words, educators and school staff are tutors, enablers and caregivers combined into one, and Mr. Ramirez truly understands how building relationships with students can have positive impacts that last a generation and beyond."" Chris Reykdal, Washington state superintendent, said, ""For his entire career, Mr. Ramirez has gone above and beyond for his students, their families, and his community as a whole. Mr. Ramirez shows us that a high-quality K-12 education isn't limited to the walls of a classroom or the daily bell schedule. He has dedicated his career to empowering his students to pursue their dreams, and I am very proud to honor him in this way."" Over his 40-year career, Ramirez has worked for multiple school districts in more than a dozen different roles, such as migrant home visitor, summer school coordinator, special education secretary, and bus driver. Ramirez now conducts home visits, bridges the gap between home and school for Spanish speaking families, and works to secure the mental health and technological resources students need. Ramirez helped to organize a night school in English and Spanish for adults in the Walla Walla community. He has supported students as they apply for and participate in youth leadership programs, as both a mentor and bus driver. And, he is credited with diminishing tensions among rival gang members in the 1990s when gang conflict was high in the Walla Walla area by coordinating supervised evening and weekend activities. Events leading to Ramirez' selection began in April 2019 when Congress passed the Recognizing Achievement in Classified School Employees Act (Public Law 116-13), which states, ""The Secretary shall select a classified school employee to receive the Recognizing Inspiring School Employees Award for the year.""

13-May-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/department-educations-federal-student-aid-denies-reinstatement-application-profit-law-school,Department of Education’s Federal Student Aid Denies Reinstatement Application of For-Profit Law School,"Today, the office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) in the U.S. Department of Education (ED) informed Florida Coastal School of Law that its application for reinstatement to participate in federal student aid programs has been denied. The action delivers on President Biden’s commitment to stop for-profit education programs from profiteering off students and comes as U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona and new FSA chief Richard Cordray are stressing that for-profit schools will be held accountable for meeting the standards for participation in the Department’s Title IV programs. ""Too often, we see for-profit schools that try to take advantage of students, misuse taxpayer dollars, and skirt the rules to participate in federal student aid programs,” Secretary Cardona said. “Today we want to be heard and understood by for-profit schools around the country: we will be vigilant in ensuring they meet their commitments to students, families, and taxpayers.” The reinstatement application for Florida Coastal School of Law was denied for three reasons: Failure of the financial responsibility standards: Failure to meet the fiduciary standard of conduct; and Failure to meet the standards of participation, including the standards of administrative capability. “Florida Coastal School of Law operated recklessly and irresponsibly, putting its students at financial risk rather than providing the opportunities they were seeking,” said Cordray. “Our commitment is to stand up for all students and ensure their institutions are held to the standards our students and communities expect and deserve.” Today’s notification comes after the school’s contract with the Department expired on March 31, 2021, when required Florida Coastal School of Law officials refused to sign the contract, effectively ending the school’s participation in the federal student aid programs. In early April, Florida Coastal School of Law applied for reinstatement. Below are additional details regarding the denial of Florida Coastal School of Law’s reinstatement application: Failure of the financial responsibility standards The federal Higher Education Act requires institutions to meet general standards of financial responsibility to participate in the federal student financial aid programs. Florida Coastal School of Law failed to meet these standards because its financial composite score for the past two fiscal years was -1.0, the lowest possible score. The institution carried significant debt due to a declining student population and issues surrounding the closure of two other schools that were also under the same ownership: Charlotte School of Law in Charlotte, North Carolina and Arizona Summit Law School in Phoenix, Arizona. Additionally, the audited financial statements for Florida Coastal School of Law contain a disclosure that raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue operations. Last month, the private equity firm that had owned 98.6% of the institution relinquished its ownership. This move demonstrated its unwillingness to assume any potential liabilities related to noncompliance rather than using its resources to support the school’s continued participation in the federal student financial aid programs. The institution’s accreditor also found that Florida Coastal School of Law was violating other standards, such as failing to provide critical services that it advertises and failing to meet its obligations to correctly determine student eligibility for the federal student financial aid programs. FSA therefore determined that the institution failed the financial responsibility standards set by federal law. Failure to meet the fiduciary standard of conduct Institutions—and the owners of the institutions—that participate in the federal student financial aid programs must adhere to a fiduciary standard of conduct and must act with the competency and integrity required as a fiduciary. In ongoing discussions for over two years, officials at Florida Coastal School of Law did not meet these standards by failing to notify FSA about accreditation issues and other significant developments related to the institution’s ownership structure. Failure to meet the standards of participation To participate in the federal student financial aid programs, institutions must adhere to all applicable statutory and regulatory provisions and must competently administer the programs with adequate internal controls. By not disclosing its accreditation and ownership issues, Florida Coastal School of Law failed to meet the standards of participation. Further steps Florida Coastal School of Law has 10 days from receipt of today’s notification to submit factual evidence to dispute FSA’s findings and seek to demonstrate their inaccuracy. If any such evidence is submitted, FSA will evaluate it and notify the institution about whether the denial of its reinstatement application will be modified, rescinded, or remain in place. The Department is poised to collaborate with state partners and the school’s accreditor to support students if Florida Coastal School of Law closes precipitously. The Department’s work would include helping students understand their options to transfer their credits to another school or apply for a closed school loan discharge. Today’s actions are part of a broader effort by ED to support the needs of America’s students and borrowers and hold for-profit institutions accountable if they fail to serve students well. In addition to today’s announcement, the Department recently streamlined the borrower defense relief process, helping approximately 72,000 borrowers whose institutions engaged in certain misconduct receive $1 billion in loan cancellation. The Department also has taken a series of steps to provide relief to borrowers during the pandemic, including extending the pause on student loan payments, affecting 40 million borrowers across the country, and ensuring hundreds of thousands of borrowers who have received student loan discharges due to total and permanent disability can keep their discharges."

12-May-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/secretary-cardona-holds-virtual-roundtable-members-asian-american-and-pacific-islander-community,Secretary Cardona Holds Virtual Roundtable with Members of the Asian American and Pacific Islander Community,"This afternoon, U.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona held a virtual roundtable with members of the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community to discuss their experiences during the pandemic and ongoing challenges related to education in their communities. The participants included teachers, parents, and members of AAPI community organizations. They shared their personal experiences with the Secretary and provided feedback on ways the U.S. Department of Education (ED) can help address issues of racism, bullying, reopening schools for in-person learning, and supporting students' social, emotional, academic, and mental health needs. Secretary Cardona launched the discussion and listened as the participants shared their stories: ""I hope that together we can create a culture around our country where we're listening to the needs of our AAPI students, especially after this past year. I want to let you know that as long as I am Secretary, you have a partner at the Department and someone who wants to help lift all students—but in particular, right now we have to make sure that our AAPI students are feeling embraced, are feeling welcome, and are supported in this process."" The participants shared the challenges they have faced as teachers or helping their own children with virtual learning during the pandemic; returning to school in person and dealing with the effects of lost socialization time for students; the increase in bullying and hate towards the AAPI community; and addressing safety issues. One high school teacher said, ""I have been teaching virtually this entire year until last week. We are just transitioning back into the classroom and I've noticed that our students have missed out on social/emotional support over this past year. I highly recommend an increase in the amount of mental health resources at the school level for all our students, counselors, and more supports for restorative justice, so that our students feel like they're being supported in coming back. To start learning again, they have to first feel safe and welcomed and comfortable in the classroom, and again I think that begins with having increased mental health supports."" Cardona closed the roundtable reaffirming his commitment to address these issues affecting the AAPI community. ""In March, 61% of our AAPI 4th graders across the country were learning remotely, and a part of that is Asian families who are afraid to send their children back into an environment where they feel that they may be attacked verbally. We have to fix that. We have to be proactive about reaching out to our AAPI families and communities. There are groups that understand how to support those families; we need to do a better job connecting with those groups and bringing them into our schools, so that families feel trust with the system. I want to continue to partner and listen to make sure that all of our students across our country have a good experience. All students benefit when we lift up the voices of AAPI students and families."""
12-May-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/department-education-launches-outreach-campaign-millions-k-12-students-and-federal-pell-grant-recipients-now-eligible-monthly-discounts-broadband-internet-service,Department of Education Launches Outreach Campaign to Millions of K-12 Students and Federal Pell Grant Recipients Now Eligible for Monthly Discounts on Broadband Internet Service,"The U.S. Department of Education today launched a major outreach campaign to millions of students who are now eligible for a monthly discount on broadband internet service under a temporary program administered by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The campaign will inform millions of families with children participating in the free or reduced-price lunch or school breakfast program, and 6.5 million Pell Grant recipients that they are now eligible for the discount of up to $50 per month. Eligible households on qualifying Tribal lands can receive a discount of up to $75 per month. “The COVID-19 pandemic has magnified issues of internet access and affordability for both K-12 students and college students, particularly students of color, students in rural or tribal communities, and students from low-income families,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “We know that the quality of home internet access has an impact on student success, and that students without robust internet access and reliable devices struggled more with the transition to remote learning this past year. This campaign will not only keep more of America’s students connected and learning, but will help address inequities exacerbated by COVID-19. As we recover from the pandemic, we have an opportunity to rebuild our education system back better than it was before, and providing reliable, affordable internet access to more students disproportionately impacted by the pandemic is one way we can make sure all students are set up for success.” Households with a child who has received approval for benefits under the under the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) or the School Breakfast Program (SBP), including a child that attends a school participating in the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Community Eligibility Provision (CEP), during the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 school years are now eligible for the FCC’s Emergency Broadband Benefit Program (EBB Program). Pell Grant recipients, who are usually undergraduates with exceptional financial need, also qualify for the FCC’s EBB Program to help pursue postsecondary education if they received their grant during the 2020-2021 award year. The temporary program provides a monthly discount of up to $50 per month on broadband service and associated equipment (a modem, for example) for eligible households and up to $75 per month for households on qualifying Tribal lands. Each participating household may also receive a one-time discount of up to $100 for one connected device—a laptop, desktop, or tablet computer—where available from a participating broadband provider, as long as the household contributes between $10 and $50 towards the cost of the device. Eligible families of K-12 students and eligible Pell Grant recipients can apply for the discount online , via mail, or through a participating service provider. Eligible households can find participating internet service providers in their area by entering their zip code into the Companies Near Me tool. “It’s more apparent than ever that broadband is no longer nice-to-have. It’s need-to-have. For everyone, everywhere,” said acting FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel. “Seemingly overnight, the COVID-19 pandemic required millions of families and students to shift to remote learning. These students, their families, and their teachers worked hard to make remote learning a reality. But this crisis highlighted like never before that the virtual classroom was closed to millions of students without reliable internet access at home – with students of color and low-income families hit the hardest. And that’s simply unacceptable. I’m proud to partner with Secretary Cardona and the Department of Education to help get the word out about the FCC’s newest program to help families struggling with digital disconnection and provide them support.” The Education Department is reaching out directly to approximately 6.5 million Pell Grant recipients to inform them that they may be eligible for the discount. The Department is also reaching out to CEP schools and districts to inform them that they or their students may be eligible for the internet access program and share information on how to apply. Additionally, the Department is working with the FCC to develop materials to support schools, districts, and postsecondary schools in spreading the word about the program to eligible students and families. As trusted community members, schools, districts, and postsecondary schools are critical outreach partners. In addition to conducting EBB Program outreach to eligible students and families, schools can take steps to help eligible students and families navigate the sign-up process, including: Using the outreach toolkit materials to inform eligible students and families about the Emergency Broadband Benefit. The toolkit and other consumer materials can be found at fcc.gov/broadbandbenefit . Outreach resources for K-12 schools and districts can be found at Companies Near Me tool to identify participating providers. Organizing a provider fair so that students and families can compare and ask questions about the available internet service plans offered by participating local providers. For questions about the EBB Program please visit GetEmergencyBroadband.org , call 833-511-0311, or email EBBHelp@usac.org . Today’s announcement is part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s broader commitment to providing support and resources to students and communities impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, expand access to broadband, and build back better. The American Rescue Plan provides resources states and schools districts can use to close the digital divide, for example by purchasing laptops and wi-fi hotspots. The Department has also provided direct support to students through the American Rescue Plan , including informing more students of expanded eligibility for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) during the pandemic. President Biden has also proposed historic investments in the American Jobs Plan to reach 100 coverage of high-speed, reliable, broadband internet, and he has proposed in the American Families Plan to increase the maximum Pell Grant award by about $1,400."

Our top priority at the Department of Education is to reopen America's schools for in-person learning, support students' social, emotional, and academic needs, and address inequities that have been exacerbated by the pandemic. I am thrilled that Cindy has accepted this challenge and I look forward to working with her as she continues to serve our nation's students as Deputy Secretary."" About Cindy Marten Cynthia ""Cindy"" Marten was confirmed by the U.S. Senate as the Deputy Secretary on May 11, 2021.

11-May-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-makes-available-36-billion-american-rescue-plan-funds-support-students-and-institutions,U.S. Department of Education Makes Available $36 Billion in American Rescue Plan Funds to Support Students and Institutions,"The U.S. Department of Education (ED) announced more than $36 billion in emergency grants today provided under the American Rescue Plan (ARP) Act for postsecondary education. These grants will help over 5,000 institutions of higher education (institutions), including HBCUs, TCCUs, and HSIs, provide emergency financial aid to millions of students and ensure learning continues during the COVID-19 national emergency. Emergency funds provided by ARP more than double the emergency relief aid available to students and institutions already authorized under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES) and the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act (CRRSAA) relief legislation. This funding is provided by the ARP’s Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF III), with a new formula requiring approximately half of the funding to be used by each institution to provide direct relief to students. ""These funds are critical to ensuring that all of our nation’s students – particularly those disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic – have the opportunity to enroll, continue their education, graduate, and pursue their careers,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “With this action, thousands of institutions will be able to provide direct relief to students who need it most, so we can make sure that we not only recover from the pandemic, but also build back even stronger than before.” Today’s announcement will enable institutions to equitably expand opportunity by targeting resources to all students with exceptional financial need. It also reflects ED’s broader commitment to providing support, resources, and guidance to institutions, students, and communities throughout the pandemic. The previous rounds of relief funding have already made direct impacts on millions of students across the country by providing emergency financial aid to students impacted by the pandemic, assistance with distance education and technology upgrades, and mental health and student support services, among other uses. ARP will make critical investments into many of our nation’s most under-resourced institutions educating students most acutely affected by the pandemic, including more than $10 billion to community colleges, more than $2.6 billion to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), approximately $190 million to Tribally Controlled Colleges and Universities (TCCUs), and more than $6 billion to minority-serving institutions such as Hispanic-serving institutions (HSIs) and Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-serving institutions (AANAPISIs), more than doubling the funding available to these institutions under CARES and CRRSAA. To help institutions quickly and effectively utilize the ARP funds to support their students and communities, ED also released new guidance today detailing how institutions can use these funds to, among other things, support vulnerable students, monitor and suppress the coronavirus, and reengage students whose education was disrupted by the pandemic. Ways the funding can be used to have the greatest impact on students and communities include: Using emergency financial grants to support students with exceptional needs: While the pandemic has affected all students, it has hit some students and their families especially hard and has exacerbated inequities within our educational system. ED has released a final rule that allows institutions to provide emergency aid to all students. The ARP requires that institutions prioritize students with exceptional need, such as students who receive Pell Grants or undergraduates with extraordinary financial circumstances. ED’s guidance clarifies that institutions can consider a variety of factors when assessing need, such as a student’s eligibility for other federal or state need-based aid, significant unexpected expenses, loss of employment, reduced income, or food or housing insecurity. Institutions can also consider the needs of students who did not complete a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). For more details about student eligibility requirements, please see the final rule here and additional guidance here . Examples of institutions using relief funds to support students with exceptional needs: San Joaquin Delta College (HSI in Stockton, California) has already earmarked $6.2 million of their ARP allocation to provide direct grants to over 4,100 students that have shown the highest need for financial support. Fisk University (HBCU in Nashville, Tennessee) distributed over $500,000 to 100% of their students eligible for emergency aid from previous relief packages. Diné College (TCCU in Tsaile, Arizona) distributed more than $600,000 in emergency funding to students from previous relief packages. Northern Virginia Community College (Annandale, Virginia) used 25% of CARES Institutional funds for emergency grants. Retention and reengagement of students : Institutions can also use their funds to help retain students by providing academic or mental health support systems for students. Additionally, institutions can reengage students by discharging student debts at their institution accrued during the pandemic so students can re-enroll, continue their education, or obtain their official transcript to continue their education, transfer to another postsecondary institution, and/or secure employment. Examples of institutions using relief funding to retain and reengage students: Foothills-De Anza Community College (Los Altos Hills, California) established a Mental Wellness Ambassador program aimed at promoting mental health services, reducing stigma surrounding mental health disorders, creating community, and fostering an inclusive and non-judgmental campus culture, using previous rounds of relief funding. Blackfeet Community College (TCCU in Browning, Montana) purchased 500 laptops, using previous relief funding to create a loaner program to allow students to remain enrolled and engaged with their academic studies. Alcorn State University (HBCU in Alcorn, Mississippi) used previous relief funds to provide enhanced virtual academic support services. Prevent and mitigate the spread of COVID-19, including efforts to vaccinate students and campus communities: Public and private nonprofit institutions must also use a portion of their Institutional award to implement evidence-based practices to monitor and suppress coronavirus in accordance with the public health guidelines . Institutions can use funds to help detect coronavirus transmission, such as funding the costs associated with diagnostic or screening testing strategy, setting up testing sites, purchasing tests, and hiring additional personnel to administer tests. Institutions can also work to prevent the spread of the virus by using institutional funds to spread awareness and build confidence in getting vaccinated, and to set up vaccination sites on or off campus, including costs of bringing sites to rural and satellite locations. Additionally, HEERF institutional funds can be used to reduce barriers to vaccination, such as paid time off for staff to get the vaccine and costs associated with vaccination efforts. Examples of institutions using relief funds to prevent and mitigate the spread of COVID-19 : Alabama State University (HBCU in Montgomery, Alabama) used prior relief funds to prioritize the health and safety of its students, faculty, and staff through the purchase of personal protective equipment (PPE). Mountain View College (HSI in Dallas, Texas) has used prior relief funds for PPE masks and enhanced weekly cleanings. Public and private nonprofit schools can also use the institutional portion of their awards to cover a variety of institutional costs, including lost revenue, reimbursement for expenses already incurred, technology costs associated with a transition to distance education, faculty and staff trainings, and payroll. Public and private nonprofit institutions must also use a portion of their institutional award to conduct direct outreach to financial aid applicants about the opportunity to receive a financial aid adjustment due to recent unemployment of a family member or of the independent student. Proprietary schools must use their awards exclusively to provide financial aid grants to students. Institutions can learn more about allowable uses and limitation in our FAQs . Allocations to institutions are based on a formula that includes the relative shares of Federal Pell Grant recipients (on both a headcount and full-time equivalent basis), the relative shares of non-Pell Grant recipients, and the relative shares of Federal Pell recipients exclusively enrolled in distance education prior to the coronavirus emergency.

7-May-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/secretary-cardona-holds-virtual-roundtable-educators-discuss-public-service-loan-forgiveness-program,Secretary Cardona Holds Virtual Roundtable with Educators to Discuss the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program,"This afternoon, U.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona held a virtual roundtable to discuss the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program with educators who have student loans and are participating in the program. The participants included teachers from elementary and secondary schools and an occupational therapist. They shared their personal experiences with the Secretary and provided feedback on ways the Department can make it easier for borrowers to understand the PSLF program, complete their payments, communicate clearly with their loan servicers, and eventually receive loan forgiveness based on their service. Secretary Cardona launched the discussion and listened as the educators shared their stories: ""Student loan forgiveness is getting a lot of attention, and rightfully so. And we're going to be focusing on that. We have tools in our toolbox at the Department of Education that I don't think are working, and we need to fix them. We need to work hard to make sure that the intention of those tools—in this case, the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program—is working in the way it's supposed to."" One by one the teachers shared the challenges they face in repaying their student loans and meeting the current requirements of the PSLF program. ""Public Service Loan Forgiveness was passed by Congress with bipartisan support to attract talented professionals to vitally important jobs that are typically lower paying than the private sector. And while I did not go into this career to have my loans forgiven, I definitely welcome the help,"" said Christine Conlon, a school based occupational therapist from Staten Island, New York, who works with students receiving special education. ""Reform to Public Service Loan Forgiveness is definitely necessary to make pursuing degrees in higher education and careers in public service more equitable and affordable. Not having the accurate information on my repayment prevented me from making decisions that were in my best financial interest. The three-year uncertainty was grueling and impacted my approach to major life decisions, like buying a house and starting a family."" James Stewart, a high school science teacher from Maryland said, ""The past calamity associated with the loan process and the teacher loan forgiveness program cannot be undone, as each of us here today and many others have suffered. But we hope that something can be done to bring our suffering to an end. My journey was never going to happen without a price, so I'm not looking for a free ride. But the government did promise to cancel the debt for all who served 10 years or more as educators."" Cardona closed the roundtable reaffirming his commitment to improve the PSLF program: ""There's a lot of work for us to do to make this process not only more manageable, but we also have a long way to go in terms of our customer service to make sure that we're serving our borrowers and not putting them through different obstacles in order to get the support that they were promised in 2007. I commit to you that this is a priority for me."" Participants in the Roundtable included: James Stewart , high school science teacher from Maryland; member of the National Education Association. Sean Ichiro Manes , elementary music teacher from New Jersey; member of the National Education Association. Christine Conlon , occupational therapist from Staten Island, New York; member of the American Federation of Teachers. Gloria Nolan , teacher from St. Louis, Missouri; member of the American Federation of Teachers."
6-May-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/statement-us-secretary-education-miguel-cardona-results-march-2021-naep-survey-school-reopening,Statement from U.S Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona on Results of the March 2021 NAEP Survey on School Reopening,"Statement from U.S Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona on results of the March 2021 NAEP Survey on School Reopening: “The data released today reaffirms that we reached President Biden’s goal of reopening the majority of K-8 schools ahead of schedule. In March, 54% of K-8 schools were open for full-time in-person learning, and 88% were open for either full-time in-person and/or hybrid learning. Today’s data also shows positive trendlines of increasing numbers of Black, Hispanic, Asian, and American Indian/Alaska Native students enrolled in in-person learning since January. This success is the result of hard work and intentional collaboration between the Administration, states, school districts, educators, and families across the country. Nothing can replace in-person learning, and thousands of schools have made that a reality for millions of students. But we must maintain a high level of urgency. “While we’ve made important progress, I will not be satisfied until 100% of schools are safely open for full time in-person learning for all students. We are still seeing a much lower percentage of Black, Hispanic, and Asian students enrolled in full time in-person learning compared to their White counterparts. And even when offered in-person options, many Black, Hispanic, and Asian students, as well as multilingual learners and students with disabilities, are still learning fully remote. At the national and local level, we must act with urgency and bring every resource to bear to get more schools reopened full-time this spring and address the inequities that continue to persist in our classrooms and communities. The Department will continue to work with students, families, educators, states, and districts, to ensure our education system serves all students, not just some.”"
3-May-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-announces-richard-cordray-chief-operating-officer-federal-student-aid,U.S. Department of Education Announces Richard Cordray as Chief Operating Officer of Federal Student Aid,"The U.S. Department of Education (ED) announced today that it has selected Richard Cordray as the Chief Operating Officer of Federal Student Aid. Cordray is the former Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the former Attorney General of Ohio. Federal Student Aid is responsible for managing the student financial assistance programs authorized under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, including grants, work-study and loans for students attending college or career school. U.S Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona issued the following statement on Cordray's selection: ""I am thrilled that Richard Cordray will be joining the Department of Education as the Chief Operating Officer of Federal Student Aid. It is critical that students and student loan borrowers can depend on the Department of Education for help paying for college, support in repaying loans, and strong oversight of postsecondary institutions. Cordray has a strong track record as a dedicated public servant who can tackle big challenges and get results. I am confident that under his leadership, Federal Student Aid will provide the kind of service that our students, families, and schools deserve."" About Richard Cordray Richard Cordray served for six years as the first Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).

30-Apr-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-launches-best-practices-clearinghouse-highlight-innovative-practices-reopening-schools-and-campuses,U.S. Department of Education Launches Best Practices Clearinghouse to Highlight Innovative Practices for Reopening Schools and Campuses,"Today, the U.S. Department of Education (ED) launched the Safer Schools and Campuses Best Practices Clearinghouse (the Clearinghouse) , a website that highlights the innovative work underway nationwide in continuing to reopen K-12 schools, early childhood centers and postsecondary institutions. Through the Clearinghouse, the Department is providing examples of how schools and other educational institutions can safely reopen as communities continue recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic. ""It is encouraging to see states, districts and schools serving all levels of students using their best practices and lessons learned from each other and implementing these strategies to quickly reopen schools and campuses—all while keeping our students, teachers, faculty, and staff safe,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""There is no substitute for in-person learning and the Clearinghouse will be an invaluable resource as we continue the safe return to in-person instruction."" President Biden's Executive Order on Supporting the Reopening and Continuing Operation of Schools and Early Childhood Education Providers called on ED to develop a Safer Schools and Campuses Best Practices Clearinghouse as a way to share lessons learned and best practices from the field for safely operating schools and postsecondary institutions during the pandemic. By launching the Clearinghouse, ED aims to collect and disseminate innovative, evidence-based, or solutions-oriented approaches to school reopening and make this information available to elementary and secondary schools, early childhood centers, and postsecondary institutions across the country so they can learn from each other. Resources from ED and other federal agencies related to reopening strategies and guidance are also available on the website. The Clearinghouse includes resources that target the needs of students in, K-12, early childhood, and higher education settings in three main topic areas: Safe and Healthy Environments: School and campus approaches to implement prevention and mitigation strategies and prepare and sustain in-person operations safely. Supports for Students: School and campus strategies to meet students' academic, social, emotional, mental health, and other needs, including providing access to food, counselors, and financial aid for college students. Teacher, Faculty, and Staff Well-Being; Professional Development; and Supports: School and campus strategies to address skills, trauma and other mental-health needs among educators, faculty, and staff, and other support strategies such as providing access to childcare and professional development for educators. ED specifically invited submissions that focus on students most impacted by the pandemic and on strategies that address educational inequities that were exacerbated by the pandemic. Since March 25, ED has received over 500 submissions that include over 1,500 resources. The Clearinghouse currently includes over 180 resources and will continue to be updated. Examples that reflect the diversity of submissions include: The New Mexico Public Education Department published a resource to improve the identification and protection of students experiencing homelessness, either before the pandemic or as a result of COVID-19. As school districts continue to develop reopening plans and procedures, they must properly identify and support students experiencing homelessness. The resource includes case studies of promising practices on assisting homeless students and their families, and helpful resources for students and educators as they continue to navigate this school year and prepare for the next school year. Marin County Office of Education in San Rafael, California, developed a ""Rethinking Schools"" webpage, which serves as a one-stop-shop for parents, students, and educators with public health and education data. The site includes up-to-date information on in-person instruction in schools across the district, public health guidelines on safe in-person instruction, and safety plans for students and staff. Rowan-Cabarrus Community College in North Carolina developed a resource webpage that includes return to campus information and college updates for students, an FAQ on coronavirus and illness-related questions, as well as information on scholarship programs, local emergency rental assistance programs, COVID-19 vaccination appointment information, and more. Rowan-Cabarrus has included expectations and requirements for students, faculty, and staff to maintain safe in-person learning on campus, including regular health screenings and social distancing. The resource webpage also includes information for students on community resources, including local food pantry locations and hours of operation. ED has also launched a series of ""Lessons from the Field"" webinars as part of the Clearinghouse that spotlight promising practices in early childhood, K-12, and postsecondary education. The first three webinars in the series highlighted prevention strategies for safely reopening K-12 schools, new CDC guidance focused on early childhood providers, and family and community engagement during the return to in-person instruction. Future webinars will share best practices and lessons included in the Clearinghouse. The Clearinghouse is another step in a series of efforts by the Biden-Harris Administration to support the safe reopening of schools and campuses. The Administration is providing $130 billion for K-12 education in the American Rescue Plan to support safe reopening of schools; $10 billion for COVID-19 testing for PreK and K-12 educators, staff and students; and has provided nearly $40 billion for higher education institutions and students. The Administration has also urged states to prioritize vaccinations for educators; held a virtual National Safe School Reopening Summit , where districts, educators, school leaders, and students from across the country shared their best practices on how to reopen schools quickly and safely; and released two volumes of the COVID-19 Handbook , which provide roadmaps and strategies to support the safe reopening of America's schools and to meet the needs of students, educators, and staff. ED welcomes additional lessons learned and best practices from the field for consideration for the Clearinghouse, including those with an educational equity focus. Submissions should be sent via email to: Bestpracticesclearinghouse@ed.gov ."
29-Apr-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/100-days-biden-administration-how-department-education-has-helped-more-schools-safely-reopen-and-meet-students-needs,100 Days of the Biden Administration: How the Department of Education Has Helped More Schools Safely Reopen and Meet Students Needs,"During the first 100 days of the Biden Administration, the Department of Education's (ED) top priority has been to ensure students can return to schools safely, and has taken significant actions to help schools safely reopen for in-person instruction, address inequities exacerbated by the pandemic, and support the needs of all students, teachers, and staff. In less than three months, the Biden Administration has provided unprecedented resources to states and districts to achieve President Biden's goal of safely reopening the majority of K-8 schools for in-person learning and support students, families, teachers, and staff, and institutions of higher education during this challenging time. The Biden Administration has also proposed historic investments to education through the American Jobs Plan, the discretionary budget, and the American Families Plan, all to lead the country not just through recovery, but to transform our education system so students of all ages and backgrounds can access opportunities to receive a high-quality education and achieve their highest potential. The Biden Administration remains committed to accelerating this critical progress in the nation's reopening efforts. In the first 100 days, the Biden Administration has made significant strides in reopening schools for in-person learning. The Administration has: Reopened majority of K-8 schools for in-person learning: About half of elementary and middle schools were open full-time in person , according to the Institute of Education Sciences (49 percent as of February 2021). About 80 percent of public elementary and middle schools were offering some form of in-person instruction (full time and/or hybrid). Dozens of large school districts, serving over two million students have expanded in-person learning options since March 1, including: San Diego , Oakland , Indianapolis , Albuquerque , Minneapolis , and Boston . There is widespread alignment among data sources, including IES, Burbio , MCH, and the American Enterprise Institute, showing an upward trend in schools offering in-person learning nationally over time. While a significant majority of K-8 schools are offering at least some in-person learning (full time and/or hybrid) to students across the country, access to and enrollment in in-person instruction is not yet equal , with communities of color learning completely remotely at higher rates compared to their white counterparts. Over the coming days and weeks, the Department will continue its focus on understanding the root causes of these gaps, including hesitancy among parents and students in returning to in-person learning, and addressing those gaps. ED will also continue helping states and districts utilize federal funds to accelerate access to in-person learning, particularly in underserved communities, and address gaps in educational opportunities that have been exacerbated by the pandemic. Provided unprecedented resources and support to PreK-12 schools to help in their reopening efforts: Distributed $81 billion of $122 billion in American Rescue Plan (ARP) funds to states for immediate use this spring and planning ahead for summer and beyond. Through ARP's Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) funding, states now have access to unprecedented resources to help them safely reopen schools for in-person learning and address the needs of students. The funding can be used to implement the CDC's recommended prevention and mitigation strategies for K-12 schools, meet student and educators' social, emotional, and mental health needs, invest in strategies to address lost instructional time, and boldly address inequities exacerbated by the pandemic. Released two volumes of the COVID-19 Handbook. In February, the Department released Volume 1 of the COVID-19 handbook, which focused on strategies to implement CDC's recommended prevention strategies to safely reopen schools for in-person learning. Volume 2 of the Handbook, released in April, focused on strategies to address students' social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs and advance equity in reopening efforts. These handbooks were created through thoughtful engagement with stakeholders, advocates, and leaders from across the country who are doing the work in opening or supporting the safe reopening of schools. Released a State Plan application for states to access the additional $41 billion in relief funds, to be released this summer, and available to support the 2021-22 school year and beyond. States and districts must engage stakeholders and school communities in developing plans to use ARP ESSER funds to reopen schools, maintain safe and continuous in-person school operation, and address the needs and experiences of students, educators, and families. Prioritized K-12 educator, staff and child care vaccinations. At the beginning of March, President Biden issued a directive to prioritize K-12 educators, school staff, and childcare workers for vaccination, and set a goal of getting all of these essential workers at least one shot in the month of March. By the end of March, over 80 percent of educators and staff had received at least one dose. Awarded $10 billion in ARP funding to support COVID-19 testing in K-12 schools. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention awarded $10 billion to states and jurisdictions to support COVID-19 screening testing for teachers, staff, and students in K-12 schools. By ramping up testing for educators and school staff, the Administration is helping more schools to be able to safely and quickly reopen and more students. Conducted a multi-state school reopening tour to aid in school reopening efforts. Over the past month, Secretary Cardona has traveled across six states to visit K-12 schools to support and highlight their efforts to bring students back for in-person learning. During the tour, Secretary Cardona saw and shared best practices, helped districts identify challenges they are facing, and heard about unique needs facing students, educators, and staff as communities recover from the pandemic. Began distributing $800 million in ARP funds to support students experiencing homelessness. ED distributed $200 million of the $800 million in funding to help states identify students experiencing homelessness, provide wraparound services in light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and provide assistance to enable students experiencing homelessness to attend school and participate fully in school activities. ED announced the distribution of these funds at an event featuring voices of students experiencing homelessness from around the nation. The remaining $600 million in funding will go out this summer. Released nearly $1 billion in pandemic relief and other grant funds to Puerto Rico. In March, ED provided the Commonwealth immediate access to $912 million in federal education funds which had not been available to Puerto Rico as a result of previously imposed grant conditions. The release of funds marked a commitment from ED and the Biden Administration in supporting Puerto Rico as the Commonwealth recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic and recent natural disasters that have impacted students, families, and educators across the island. Held a National Safe School Reopening Summit and announced the launching of the Safer Schools and Campuses Best Practices Clearinghouse to share best practices on school reopening efforts. During the summit, states, districts, students, educators, staff, and parents heard from President Biden, Vice President Harris, First Lady Biden, Secretary Cardona, CDC Director Walensky, and engaged with each other about how to safely reopen more schools and support students as they return to in-person learning. Best practices at the summit and in the forthcoming Clearinghouse also focus on utilizing ARP and other federal funds to invest in under-resourced and underserved communities to make sure schools can reopen safely and stay open, and to ensure reopening efforts are advancing equity and rebuilding our education system better than it was before the pandemic. Launched the Summer Learning and Enrichment Collaborative , a partnership between the Department of Education, the National Governors Association, the Council of Chief State School Officers, and other national partners to design and launch evidence-based summer enrichment and learning programs for students this summer. The Collaborative brings together state and local leaders and key stakeholders to identify ways to utilize ARP and other federal funding to develop summer programs that address the lost instructional, social, and extracurricular time students have experienced as a result of the pandemic, especially underserved students and those disproportionately affected by COVID-19. Over 46 states and territories have joined the Collaborative to act urgently to prepare programming for this summer. Provided support and relief to students, borrowers, and postsecondary institutions impacted by the pandemic: Included $40 billion in emergency relief for institutions of higher education in the American Rescue Plan to provide emergency aid for students and to support institutions in their efforts to keep students enrolled and completing their programs. The funding allows institutions to provide emergency financial assistance to students to help them cover the cost of tuition as well as basic needs like housing, health care, and technology. ARP includes additional funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), and institutions such as Hispanic-serving institutions (HSIs), Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-serving institutions (AANAPISIs), and other minority-serving institutions (MSIs), which face additional challenges in serving students who have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. Extended the pause on federal student loan payments , saving borrowers $5 billion dollars a month so they can focus on covering necessities during the pandemic. ED also expanded the student loan pause to cover defaulted federal loans held by banks and other private companies. The pause affects over 40 million borrowers across the country. Took action to help more than 230,000 borrowers who have received student loan discharges due to total and permanent disability. ED reinstated discharges for 41,000 borrowers and took steps to help another 190,000 keep their discharges. These actions will ensure these borrowers are not at risk of having their loans reinstated for failure to provide earnings information during the COVID-19 emergency. Provided full relief for approved borrower defense claims. The Department announced it will streamline debt relief determinations for tens of thousands of borrowers whose institutions engaged in certain misconduct. This action is anticipated to affect up to 72,000 borrowers who could receive $1 billion in loan relief combined. Provided guidance on unemployment insurance and federal student aid available to students . In January, ED released a letter reminding student financial aid administrators of their ability to make it easier for those who are unemployed or have received unemployment assistance to get federal aid for postsecondary education. Reached out to millions of students informing them of expanded eligibility for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits. In partnership with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, ED released guidance to institutions about the temporarily expanded SNAP eligibility for students in need. ED has since emailed millions of students directly to let them know that they meet certain eligibility for these benefits. Provided support and guidance to institutions of higher education on how to use emergency relief funds to support students during the pandemic. Since the Department's guidance released in March, nearly two-thirds of institutions increased their spending of emergency relief funds to support students and their communities as they work to recover from the pandemic. Discharged over $1.6 billion in HBCUs' capital finance debt, providing relief to 45 institutions across the country that participate in the HBCU Capital Finance Program. The action enabled these institutions to focus their resources on supporting students, faculty, and staff for the duration of the COVID-19 national emergency. Helped small business owners with student loans access the Paycheck Protection Program. ED requested a waiver from the Small Business Administration so that individuals will still be eligible for a Paycheck Protection Program loan and related loan forgiveness even if they currently or previously defaulted on federal student loans or were previously being delinquent on payments. The waiver immediately helped nearly 30,000 small business owners. Proposed historic new investments in America's educational system to lead the country through an economic recovery and build the education system back better than it was before: Make historic investments in high-poverty schools. President Biden's discretionary budget request provides $36.5 billion for Title I grants, a $20 billion increase compared to the 2021 enacted level, and the largest year-over-year increase since the creation of the Title I program. This investment will ensure every student – including those from disadvantaged backgrounds – can learn and thrive and advance the President's commitment to ensuring teachers are paid competitively, increasing access to PreK, equitable access to rigorous curriculum, and meaningful incentives for states to examine and address the inequalities in their school funding systems. Modernize and rebuild our nation's schools and early learning facilities. Even before the pandemic, too many students have attended schools and child care centers that are run-down, unsafe, and pose health risks. Through the American Jobs Plan, President Biden is calling on Congress to make investments that will support $100 billion to upgrade and build new public schools, $12 billion to invest in community college infrastructure, and $25 billion to upgrade child care facilities and increase the supply of child care in areas that need it most. Expand reach and access of broadband to ensure all students can compete in a global economy. The American Jobs Plan prioritizes building ""future proof"" broadband infrastructure in unserved and underserved areas so that we finally reach 100 percent high-speed broadband coverage. The President is also committed to working with Congress to find a solution to reduce internet prices for all Americans, increase adoption in both rural and urban areas, hold providers accountable, and save taxpayer money. Invest $9 billion in teachers. The investments in the American Families Plan will address critical teacher shortages, increase pipelines for teachers of color, and provide training and support to help teachers grow and keep great teachers in the classroom. Provide universal access to Pre-K for all American families. The President's American Families Plan includes an $200 billion investment to provide access to Pre-K for all three- and four-year-olds. Invest in community colleges and minority-serving institutions. The American Families Plan includes a $109 billion investment to provide two years of free community college to all Americans. The plan also includes tuition subsidies for students from low and middle-income households attending HBCUs and MSIs, which, when paired with free community college, would provide students with four years of free college. Increase investments in Pell Grants to support students most in need. Through the discretionary budget request and the American Families Plan, President Biden is proposing to invest $88 billion in order to increase the maximum Pell Grant award by approximately $1,800. In the coming days and weeks, the Department of Education will continue supporting states, districts, institutions, schools, students, teachers, faculty, and staff in their reopening and recovery efforts. In addition to helping more schools implement strategies to reopen for in-person learning, ED will work closely with communities to ensure students' social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs and educator and staff well-being are met, and that federal funding is utilized to rebuild our education system back better than it was before March 2020."

26-Apr-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/secretary-cardona-holds-virtual-roundtable-military-children-during-month-military-child,Secretary Cardona Holds Virtual Roundtable with Military Children During Month of Military Child,"This afternoon, Education Secretary Miguel Cardona held a virtual roundtable with military- connected students who are in schools near military installations around the globe. The conversation comes in April, which marks the Month of the Military Child, when our nation pays tribute to the resilience and tenacity of military children. The students in the roundtable ranged from Pre-K to 12th grade. They shared their personal experiences with the Secretary and provided feedback on ways the education leaders could make their learning experience smoother. Secretary Cardona listened as students shared their stories: “The purpose of this round table is for me, as the Secretary of Education, just to listen, to listen to what's working and what you wish could happen, so that we can make sure that we're supporting our military connected students. We’re indebted to you and not a day goes by where I don’t appreciate the sacrifices that are being made for the freedom that I enjoy.” One by one the students shared some of the challenges they face as military children. Some of these included, the struggle of socialization, different standards from one state to another, and many felt the pressure of having one parent deployed. They also reiterated the need for school leaders to have a little more patience with them because they average a move to a new school three-to-four times during a five-year period. “One way our school helps military students is by having a military student ambassador welcome the new student. This helps ease some of the socialization stress we face from going from one school to another in such a short period of time,” said Elizabeth, a 12th grader at Knob Noster High School in Missouri. Cardona closed the roundtable reaffirming his commitment to the military children. “We have to make sure we’re making things as easy as possible for you to get your education and remove barriers that might exist,” he said. “Not only do you have more to do because you are military-connected, whether it’s the constant moving or learning a new a curriculum, there’s so much more on your plate and you’re handling it with so much grace. I’m really proud to have been part of this conversation.” There are over 2 million active duty, National Guard, Reserve and children of veterans who did not make the choice to serve, but live each day supporting their brave parents."
26-Apr-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-launches-national-summer-learning-enrichment-collaborative-help-students-most-impacted-pandemic,U.S. Department of Education Launches National Summer Learning & Enrichment Collaborative to Help Students Most Impacted by the Pandemic,"NOTE : Press interested in covering the launch of the Collaborative may register here to receive updated meeting information and links to join National Convening on April 26 and 27. The U.S. Department of Education (ED) launched the Summer Learning & Enrichment Collaborative today, providing support to 46 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Bureau of Indian Education, and three territories working together to use American Rescue Plan and other federal pandemic relief funding to support as many students as possible through enriching and educational summer programming. Summer programs are key in the nation’s efforts to address lost instructional and extracurricular time as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Collaborative—a partnership between ED, the Council of Chief State School Officers, the National Governors Association, and other national partners—follows President Joe Biden’s call to action at ED’s National Safe School Reopening Summit to, “work together to ensure that all children have access to high quality summer learning and enrichment opportunities this summer and beyond.” Biden added that, “This is essential for all students, particularly those disproportionately impacted by the pandemic, students of color, English learners, students with disabilities, homeless students, and all those who went without in-person instruction this year.” The Collaborative brings together state and local leaders working alongside key stakeholders to design evidence-based summer programs that address the lost instructional, social, and extracurricular time students have experienced as a result of the pandemic, especially underserved students and those disproportionately affected by COVID-19. “Too many students have experienced interruptions in learning and negative effects on their social and emotional wellbeing due to time apart from friends and community,” said Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “Summer presents a key opportunity for school districts and community partners to accelerate learning and provide new avenues for students to safely engage with each other in fun activities. Let’s use this moment to reimagine what fun, engaging summer programming can look like, make it accessible for all students, and work together to make sure our communities recover and rebuild stronger than they were before the pandemic.” The American Rescue Plan Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ARP ESSER) Fund provides nearly $122 billion to states and school districts and requires that states invest at least $1.2 billion on evidence-based summer enrichment programs. Under the ARP ESSER Fund, school districts are also required to use at least $21 billion for evidence-based initiatives to address the impact of lost instructional time, including summer programs. ED recently released the ARP ESSER state plan application template , which invites states to describe their plans for how they will engage their communities to distribute and utilize ARP ESSER funds. Over the next two days, ED will convene states for virtual learning sessions to kick off the Collaborative. The Collaborative aims to both take a national approach to understanding best practice and rapidly setting up fun, innovative, and engaging summer opportunities for students, while also facilitating regional and local level partnerships to ensure speedy and robust implementation of state- and district-level plans. The convening will include sessions on forming state-level coalitions; using evidence to inform summer programs; and using federal funds to promote equity through summer enrichment opportunities that support social, emotional, and academic development. Speakers include: Secretary Miguel Cardona, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, Illinois State Superintendent of Education Dr. Carmen Ayala, Arkansas Secretary of Education Johnny Key, Education Trust Interim CEO Denise Forte, National Summer Learning Association CEO Aaron Dworkin, and Founder of the Harlem Children’s Zone Geoffrey Canada. Participants will discuss how to design summer programming in ways that create safe, welcoming, and inclusive environments that reengage students socially, emotionally, and academically as they recover from the impacts of COVID-19. Summer activities can include opportunities to accelerate learning, along with a broad array of enrichment activities ranging from physical fitness and heal education; arts programs; science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) activities; and career and technical education (CTE) programs; to youth development. For older students, these opportunities can include a work-based learning or community service component. The Collaborative also emphasizes the importance of offering the necessary supports to ensure all students have access to summer learning and enrichment programs—including students with disabilities, English learners, students from low-income backgrounds, and students experiencing homelessness. In addition to the launch of the Collaborative, ED recently released Volume 2 of the COVID-19 Handbook, which outlines strategies to meet the needs of underserved students, including summer learning opportunities. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently released guidance for operating youth and summer camps during COVID-19. The guidance is intended to help camp administrators operate camps while preventing the spread of COVID-19 and protecting campers, their families, staff, and communities. The Summer Learning & Enrichment Collaborative will prioritize and maintain a clear and ongoing emphasis on health and safety in all summer offerings. Organizations participating in The Collaborative’s convening include : AASA, The School Superintendents Association American Camp Association American Federation of Teachers Boys & Girls Clubs of America Charles Stewart Mott Foundation Council of Chief State School Officers Council of the Great City Schools National Association of Elementary School Principals National Association of Secondary School Principals National Education Association National Governors Association National League of Cities National Rural Education Association National Summer Learning Association National Youth Employment Coalition Nebraska Children and Families Foundation RAND Corporation StriveTogether The Afterschool Alliance The Education Trust The National Comprehensive Center Wallace Foundation Additional information about the Collaborative is available here . Planning meetings as well as regional and theme based convenings will take place in May through July, and the Department will provide additional technical assistance to states and districts upon request. At the end of the summer, the Department will hold a second national convening to discuss implementation success and challenges."

Joe Manchin (WV) and Patty Murray (WA) where they spoke with students who have experienced homelessness. The conversation came on the heels of the Department of Education (ED) announcing plans to distribute $800 million in American Rescue Plan funds to states to support students experiencing homelessness, particularly those disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. ED will distribute $200 million of the total funding to states on Monday. The students in the roundtable ranged from ages 12-20 and represented seven different states. Event participants shared their personal experiences with the Secretary and the Senators, centering the conversation on lived experiences and how the critical funds in the American Rescue Plan will help other students in similar situations. Secretary Cardona listened as students shared their stories: ""Among the issues that affect our students' ability to learn is the instability in where they're living, and homelessness is an issue that's critically important. It's hard to learn if you're wondering where you're going to be staying at night, or if there's no stability there and you don't have any support around that you. We need to make sure that our students can learn at high levels and addressing student homelessness is one of those issues that is critically important. All of you are stronger than most students in this country, and you're resilient. You're going to grow. It's our job to make sure we support you because you have so much to offer."" Sen. Joe Manchin discussed the importance of sharing these stories and providing relief for these students. ""It is vital to provide all of our young students with a platform to share their stories and experiences. I'm pleased the Department of Education is committed to helping our children and youth succeed in spite of the challenges they face. We all know, last year has added burdens for us all, especially our children currently experiencing homelessness, but we will get through this together, as we always do, by supporting our fellow Americans in need. Each and every one of you here today embody resilience, strength and determination."" Sen. Patty Murray thanked the students for sharing their experiences and applauded the designated funds in the American Rescue Plan that goes towards helping students who are experiencing homelessness. ""This past year has been so difficult for every student and parent and educator across the country. But what students who are experiencing homelessness have gone through is really unthinkable…So as a mom and a grandmother, my heart truly goes out to each one of you because these are struggles that no kid should have to bear. Please know, I want you to know, we're fighting for you. We hear you. You are not alone. We made sure that there is dedicated support in the American Rescue Plan."""

ED announced the state allocations for the $800 million total allocated in the American Rescue Plan and will distribute $200 million in funding on Monday. Alongside the announcement, the Department issued a letter to Chief State School Officers underscoring the urgent need to use this funding to identify homeless children and youth, provide wraparound services in light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and provide assistance to enable homeless children and youth to attend school and participate fully in school activities, including in-person instruction this spring and upcoming summer learning and enrichment programs. The remaining funds will be allocated to states as soon as June. ""The pandemic made the inequities in our education system even worse, especially for students experiencing homelessness,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""As districts and schools return to in-person learning, we must act with urgency to provide all students, including students experiencing homelessness, equitable access to high-quality learning environments and the resources to help meet their basic needs which schools often provide."" The Department's letter to Chief State School Officers provides additional information and recommendations to support states and school districts in putting these resources to work to support students experiencing homelessness, particularly for student groups who have been historically underserved. On Friday, April 23, 2021, at 4:15 p.m. ET, Secretary Cardona will lead a roundtable discussion with students who have experienced homelessness, centering the conversation on lived experiences and critical federal investments. Secretary Cardona will be joined by U.S. Sen. Patty Murray (WA) , Chair of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) and U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin (WV) . Together, they will learn about the individual background of each student and discuss how American Rescue Plan funds can support students experiencing homelessness. Members of the press who wish to cover the event may RSVP by emailing press@ed.gov . Today's announcement received praise from Members of Congress from both sides of the aisle: ""This past year has been so difficult for every student, parent and educator across the country—but what students experiencing homelessness have gone through is unthinkable. The first thing we told people during this pandemic was to 'stay home.' But so many students don't have a safe place to call home, access to internet, devices, or critical services that students have relied on to learn during this pandemic,"" said U.S. Sen. Patty Murray (WA), Chair of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP). ""We fought hard to make sure the American Rescue Plan includes dedicated funding for students experiencing homelessness, and that the Department of Education is acting quickly to get these resources to our communities. I'll keep fighting to make sure students experiencing homelessness not only get enrolled in school, but also get the kind of support and stability they need so they can learn and grow in the classroom."" ""The COVID-19 pandemic has created additional burdens for everyone but especially our students currently experiencing homelessness,"" said U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin (WV) . ""I am pleased Secretary Cardona is moving quickly to get the first round of the $800 million I successfully fought to include in the American Rescue Plan to school systems so they can identify and assist homeless students in their schools. If we can't find these students, we can't provide the essential support and services they need. I won't stop fighting to put a roof over every student's head and ensure they have the tools to succeed. I look forward to continue working with my bipartisan colleagues as well as Secretary Cardona to help every student thrive."" ""It is significant that every single one of my colleagues recognized the importance of supporting homeless youth and children by unanimously agreeing to my amendment twice on the Senate floor earlier this year,"" said U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (AK) . ""I thank President Biden and Secretary Cardona for working with me and my colleagues to get this funding out the door as quickly and effectively as possible. By releasing this first round of funding, we can start to provide much-needed relief to the most vulnerable - homeless youth and children. I appreciate that Secretary Cardona has invited a young Alaskan to participate in a roundtable discussion with students who have experienced homelessness. This young Alaskan, who has persevered and is now thriving, will be a strong voice for so many other young people throughout our country."" ""Arizona youth experiencing, or at risk of homelessness, deserve safe and stable shelter, especially during the pandemic. I'm proud of our work across the aisle ensuring the COVID-relief law included our bipartisan Emergency Family Stabilization Fund, helping protect Arizona families and children from housing insecurity and keeping kids connected to their school work,"" said U.S. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (AZ).

21-Apr-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-education-department-releases-state-plan-template-american-rescue-plan-elementary-and-secondary-school-emergency-relief-fund,U.S. Education Department Releases State Plan Template for the American Rescue Plan Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund,"Today, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) released the State plan application that will support states in describing how they will use resources under the American Rescue Plan Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ARP ESSER) fund to continue to safely reopen schools, sustain their safe operations, and support students—especially those most impacted by the pandemic. Last month, states received access to two-thirds of their ARP ESSER allocation—a total of $81 billion. The remaining $41 billion will become available after states' plans are approved by the Department. After the final one-third of funds are made available, states would have received access to nearly $122 billion to help safely reopen and sustain the safe operation of schools and address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our nation's students. ""Throughout my recent school visits, I have witnessed how federal relief dollars are being used to help schools reopen safely and communities recover from the impacts of the pandemic,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""These American Rescue Plan funds are essential to providing more in-person learning options for students quickly, sustaining schools' safe operations, supporting our students' social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs, and boldly addressing inequities that were exacerbated by the pandemic. In developing plans to utilize these funds, it's critical that states and districts bring to the table the voices of those who can best speak to how we can meet these goals, including students, parents, educators, and stakeholders."" Today's action demonstrates the Biden-Harris Administration's continued commitment to support states in their ongoing efforts to sustain the safe reopening of schools and to maximize in-person instruction safely and quickly. The State plan application presents an opportunity for states and local education agencies to engage the public to ensure that the needs of students and communities are best reflected in state and local spending plans. Many states and school districts are already actively developing their plans for the use of ARP ESSER funds. At the state level, stakeholder engagement must include students; families; Tribal Nations; civil rights organizations, including disability rights organizations; teachers, principals, school leaders, other educators, school staff and their unions, school and district administrators; superintendents; charter school leaders; and other stakeholders representing the interests of children with disabilities, English learners, children experiencing homelessness, children and youth in foster care, migratory students, children who are incarcerated, and other underserved students. In addition to the State plans, school districts will also be required to seek broad public input and develop their own plans for the use of ARP ESSER funds. This is in addition to the statutory requirement in the American Rescue Plan that school districts develop a plan for the safe return to in-person instruction and continuity of services. In the State plan, states will describe how they will ensure states and school districts are demonstrating transparency in their planning, identify and meet the needs of students most impacted by the pandemic, choose effective evidence-based interventions, and prioritize educational equity, inclusive stakeholder engagement, and strong fiscal safeguards. These plans will provide critical information to the public and the Department about the use of these unprecedented resources. The plans will also inform the Department's technical assistance to states and school districts, as well as the Department's approach to monitoring implementation of ARP ESSER funds. States must submit their ARP ESSER State plans by June 7, 2021. The Department will begin approving applications and disbursing the remaining ARP ESSER funds expeditiously once plans are received and reviewed. To support states in completing their ARP ESSER State Plans and meeting ARP ESSER requirements, the Department has also issued an accompanying notice of interim final requirements with additional details. The notice is available here: https://oese.ed.gov/offices/american-rescue-plan/american-rescue-plan-elementary-and-secondary-school-emergency-relief/ . States must also commit to several actions as part of their receipt of ARP ESSER funds. One addresses civil rights protections, reflecting the state's responsibility to ensure that it will conduct all its operations so that no person shall be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subject to discrimination based on race, color, national origin, which includes a person's limited English proficiency or English learner status and a person's actual or perceived shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics; sex; age; or disability. Other important commitments address transparency and compliance with ARP ESSER requirements such as uses of funds, maintenance of effort, and maintenance of equity. Today's actions are part of the Biden Administration's broader efforts to help schools quickly and safely reopen for in-person instruction. In addition to providing $130 billion for K-12 education in the American Rescue Plan to support the safe reopening of K-12 schools, the Biden Administration has: Released two volumes of the COVID-19 Handbook, which provide roadmaps and strategies to support the safe reopening of all America's schools and to promote educational equity by addressing opportunity gaps that have been exacerbated by the pandemic. Held a National Safe School Reopening Summit , where districts, educators, school leaders, and students shared best practices on how to reopen schools quickly and safely.

Several meal service flexibilities that enable social distancing are now extended through June 30, 2022. The waivers continue the Administration’s commitment to provide safe, healthy meals free of charge to children as the pandemic continues to threaten the food and nutrition security of our most vulnerable. “USDA will remain relentless in ensuring our nation’s children get the critical nutrition they need,” said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. “States and districts wanted waivers extended to plan for safe reopening in the fall. USDA answered the call to help America’s schools and childcare institutions serve high quality meals while being responsive to their local needs as children safely return to their regular routines. This action also increases the reimbursement rate to school meal operators so they can serve healthy foods to our kids. It’s a win-win for kids, parents and schools.” A recent study from Tufts University found that in 2018, schools were the single healthiest source of U.S. food consumed across a sample of children and adults. The 2018 study found that diet quality for foods from schools improved significantly from a similar study conducted in 2003-2004. Schools nationwide will be allowed to serve meals through USDA’s National School Lunch Program Seamless Summer Option (SSO), which is typically only available during the summer months. This option maintains the nutrition standards of the standard school meal programs – including a strong emphasis on providing fruits and vegetables, fluid milk, whole grains, and sensible calorie levels, while allowing schools to serve free meals to all children. In addition, schools that choose this option will receive higher-than-normal meal reimbursements for every meal they serve, which will support them in serving the most nutritious meals possible while managing increased costs associated with pandemic-related operational and supply chain challenges. This option also affords schools the financial flexibility to further customize their meal service design to fit their local needs. “Students’ success in the classroom goes hand in hand with their ability to access basic needs like healthy and nutritious meals,” said Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “It’s critical that our efforts to reopen schools quickly and safely include programs that provide access to free, healthy meals for our most vulnerable students, particularly those whose communities have been hardest hit by the pandemic. This program will ensure more students, regardless of their educational setting, can access free, healthy meals as more schools reopen their doors for in-person learning.” USDA will continue to offer targeted meal pattern flexibility and technical assistance as needed. In addition, schools and both child and adult care institutions can continue providing breakfasts, lunches, and after school snacks in non-group settings at flexible meal times. Parents or guardians can also pick up meals for their children when programs are not operating normally, all while maintaining social distancing consistent with federal recommendations. Up to 12 million children are currently living in households where they may not always have enough to eat during the pandemic. During the past year, America’s schools and childcare centers have provided a nutrition lifeline for children across the country, many of whom depend on USDA’s child nutrition programs for the nourishment they need to grow and thrive. Some kids rely on these programs for as many as three meals a day, underscoring how essential it is for USDA to empower schools and childcare centers to continue their dedicated efforts to serve healthy meals, safely. Earlier this month, the Department of Education released Volume 2 of its COVID-19 Handbook , “Roadmap to Reopening Safely and Meeting All Students’ Needs,” which includes initial recommendations and resources for schools and communities to support our nation’s most vulnerable students during the pandemic, including those facing food insecurity. The Handbook includes strategies to increase student and family access to meal programs during the school year and over the summer, including specific strategies for underserved students such as students experiencing homelessness and English learners, and how federal funding can support these efforts. The announcement today comes in addition to a variety of actions taken recently by USDA to strengthen food security, drive down hunger, and put a greater emphasis on the importance of nutrition. Just recently, USDA maximized economic relief for struggling families by taking administrative action on SNAP emergency allotments by targeting an additional $1 billion per month to roughly 25 million people. The Biden-Harris Administration’s American Rescue Plan Act provides over $12 billion in new nutrition assistance to address hardship caused by the pandemic, including: Extending a 15 percent increase in SNAP benefits— providing over $1.1 billion per month in additional benefits for about 41 million participants—through September 2021; Adding $1.1 billion in new funding for territories that operate nutrition assistance block grants—home to nearly 3 million Americans—to support those hard-hit by the pandemic; Extending and expanding P-EBT—a program that served over 8.4 million families with children at its peak last year—through the duration of the public health emergency; Funding meals for young adults experiencing homelessness through Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) emergency shelters; Providing nearly $900 million for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC), including a temporary increase in fruit and vegetable vouchers to $35 per month and an historic investment in innovation and outreach to better serve more than 6.2 million people that use WIC to support a healthy start for infants and young children. For a complete list of the waiver actions announced today, visit FNS’s COVID Response page at www.fns.usda.gov/coronavirus . USDA touches the lives of all Americans each day in so many positive ways. In the Biden-Harris Administration, USDA is transforming America’s food system with a greater focus on more resilient local and regional food production, fairer markets for all producers, ensuring access to safe, healthy and nutritious food in all communities, building new markets and streams of income for farmers and producers using climate smart food and forestry practices, making historic investments in infrastructure and clean energy capabilities in rural America, and committing to equity across the Department by removing systemic barriers and building a workforce more representative of America.

Secretary Cardona listened to students and parents and promised to take the information he learned and the stories he heard back to stakeholders and policymakers. During the conversation, participants shared highlights and asked for improvements based on their experiences during the pandemic. Some of the students spoke about the importance of continuing to use prevention practices such as wearing masks consistently and correctly. The Secretary encouraged them to share that same information with their peers as a way to support everyone's safety and hasten a return to safe social events. Other students shared that they miss social activities and interactions among their peers. A twelfth-grade student who joined the conversation said, ""I would say in class we would have discussions, when we moved to virtual it is impossible to get the same type of engagement in class discussions. A lot of the communication between students and teachers broke down."" Secretary Cardona also asked each student about how they are dealing with their mental and emotional health. ""Parents and teachers think that kids can handle all of the stress, but there are mental health issues that are being neglected. We haven't been able to see our friends and need more social interaction during school,"" said a seventh-grade student who participated in the conversation. Secretary Cardona said, ""Listening to all of you, I feel that there's a sense of urgency to get this right because our kids are waiting. Throughout this conversation, I took great notes. I'm gathering information so when I meet with the President, when I meet with policymakers and folks that are interested in education, we have your voice at the table."""

9-Apr-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-releases-covid-19-handbook-volume-2-roadmap-reopening-safely-and-meeting-all-students-needs,"U.S. Department of Education Releases ""COVID-19 Handbook, Volume 2: Roadmap to Reopening Safely and Meeting All Students' Needs""","Today, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) released the COVID-19 Handbook, Volume 2: Roadmap to Reopening Safely and Meeting All Students' Needs to provide additional strategies for safely reopening all of America's schools and to promote educational equity by addressing opportunity gaps that have been exacerbated by the pandemic. Building off of Volume 1: Strategies for Safely Reopening Elementary and Secondary Schools , which focused on health and safety measures that schools can use to successfully implement the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) K-12 Operational Strategy , Volume 2 of the Handbook focuses on research-based strategies to address the social, emotional, mental-health, and academic impacts of the pandemic on students, educators, and staff, such as how to address any potential anxiety or depression some may face as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and nearly a year of remote learning. ""There is simply no substitute for in-person learning,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""But as schools reopen their doors, we must also make sure that we are meeting students' social, emotional, physical, mental-health, and academic needs, and addressing gaps that existed before—and were exacerbated by—the pandemic. This is an opportunity for us to not only reopen our schools safely, but to make sure our education systems are truly serving all our nation's students."" Today's release is part of the Biden-Harris Administration's broader effort to provide states, districts, schools, and communities with the resources and support they need to return to in-person learning safely and quickly, and achieve the President's goal of reopening a majority of K-8 schools within the first 100 days of the Administration. Volume 2 identifies strategies states, districts, schools, and communities can use when implementing funding they have received from the American Rescue Plan, which invests $130 billion in safely reopening schools, sustaining their safe in-person operation, and addressing the impact of COVID-19. Volume 2 also aims to meet President Biden's call for communities and the country to ""build back better."" As states and districts continue to reopen schools safely, the Department is encouraging communities to implement strategies that address the social, emotional, and mental-health needs of students, including the disproportionate toll COVID-19 has had on underserved communities, and address inequities in our education system that predate and have been made worse by the pandemic. In February, the Department released Volume 1 of the COVID-19 Handbook, which provides educators and staff with practical examples, roadmaps, and tools to implement the CDC's K-12 operational strategy for in-person learning, including the recommended five key mitigation measures ( universal and correct use of masks ; physical distancing ; handwashing and respiratory etiquette ; maintaining clean and healthy facilities, including through ventilation; and contact tracing in combination with isolation and quarantine). Since the release of Volume 1, the Department and CDC have met with educators; state and local elected officials, including governors, mayors, and legislative leaders in every state and territory; chief state school officers; state boards of education; and stakeholder organizations across the country about how to safely reopen schools. Volume 2 includes many strategies and resources informed by these conversations and recommended by education, civil rights, and research organizations. As part of the launch of Volume 2, Secretary Cardona will hold a virtual roundtable with a diverse group of students and parents today, Friday, April 9, to discuss how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected their education and their lives, and how the tools and resources in Volume 2 of the handbook can help assist schools and communities in addressing student needs. Strategies described in Volume 2 can be supported by funding under the American Rescue Plan. Each section provides strategies and considerations for meeting the needs of underserved students. The sections include: Providing school meals regardless of educational setting. Meeting the social, emotional, and mental-health needs of students. Providing all students with access to a safe and inclusive learning environment. Accelerating learning through in-classroom instructional approaches, tutoring, and expanded learning time. Supporting equitable access and effective use of technology for teaching and learning. Using data about students' opportunities to learn to help target resources and support. Addressing resource inequities. Stabilizing a diverse and qualified educator workforce. Supporting educator and staff well-being. The Department will continue to provide support and resources to schools and communities as they work to return to in-person instruction safely. Later this month, the Department will launch its "" Safer Schools and Campuses Best Practices Clearinghouse ,"" which is open for submissions from states, schools, districts, and individuals nationwide. Once launched, the Clearinghouse will highlight lessons learned and best practices that can help schools and districts identify opportunities to utilize American Rescue Plan funds to meet their unique needs."

In a letter to students, educators, and other stakeholders, OCR outlined plans to solicit the public's input on the regulations, ultimately leading to possible revisions through a notice of proposed rulemaking. ""Building educational environments free from discrimination where our nation's students can grow and thrive is a top priority of the Biden-Harris Administration,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""Today's action is the first step in making sure that the Title IX regulations are effective and are fostering safe learning environments for our students while implementing fair processes. Sexual harassment and other forms of sex discrimination, including in extracurricular activities and other educational settings, threaten access to education for students of all ages. As Secretary, I will work to ensure all students—no matter their background, who they are, or how they identify—can succeed in the classroom and beyond."" The March 8 Executive Order stresses the Biden-Harris Administration's commitment to the nation's students and its belief that all students should be guaranteed an educational environment free from discrimination on the basis of sex, including in the form of sexual harassment, which encompasses sexual violence, and including discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The Executive Order requires the Department to review and reconsider all existing regulations, orders, guidance documents, policies, and any other similar agency actions, including the 2020 amendments to the Department's Title IX regulations, formally known as the ""Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance."" The letter to stakeholders explains that OCR is undertaking a comprehensive review of the Department's existing regulations and other actions related to Title IX by gathering the public's views and insights on the issue of sexual harassment in school environments, including sexual violence, and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. This feedback will help OCR determine what additional changes to the Title IX regulations and any related agency actions may be necessary to fulfill the Executive Order. The input will also support the Department's commitment to ensuring equal and nondiscriminatory access to education for students in schools across the nation, from pre-K-12 and in postsecondary institutions, including in extracurricular activities and other educational settings. During this review process, the existing Title IX regulations, as amended in 2020, remain in effect. As part of this comprehensive review, OCR seeks to hear from as many interested parties as possible. To facilitate this, OCR plans to hold a public hearing to enable those who are interested to share their views through oral comments and written submissions. More information on the hearing will be available in the coming weeks and will be posted on the News Room section of OCR's website at http://www.ed.gov/ocr/newsroom.html . After listening to the public and completing its review of the Title IX regulations, OCR anticipates publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking. To assist schools, students, and others in better understanding OCR's expectations with respect to compliance with Title IX and the 2020 amendments, OCR will also issue a new question-and-answer document in the coming weeks. ""Throughout this process, the Office for Civil Rights will be guided by our responsibility to ensure that schools are providing appropriate support for students who have experienced sexual harassment, including sexual violence, and that school procedures are fair and equitable for all parties and cognizant of the sensitive issues that are often involved,"" said Suzanne B. Goldberg, acting assistant secretary for civil rights. ""The Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights is responsible for and fully committed to enforcing Title IX's protections to ensure equal access to education for all students regardless of sex. This includes making certain that students who have experienced discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity have their legal rights fully met."""

This action will provide debt relief to 45 HBCUs – 13 public institutions and 32 private institutions. ""Our HBCUs have long been on an uneven playing field, financially, as compared to many other postsecondary institutions,"" said Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""This relief will further support these mission-critical institutions and help to ensure they have more resources to educate and graduate students during the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic."" The FAFSA Simplification Act, which was included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, signed into law in December 2020, provided authority and funding to discharge debts held by HBCUs under the HBCU Capital Financing Program. In combination with funds provided in the American Rescue Plan, signed by President Biden on March 11, 2021, and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), HBCUs will also receive more than $5 billion through the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund programs. Since 1994, the HBCU Capital Financing Program has provided low-cost loans to finance and refinance infrastructure improvements at the nation's HBCUs. Discharging these debts helps enable these institutions to focus their resources on supporting students, faculty, and staff for the duration of the COVID-19 national emergency. HBCUs can dedicate more funds to innovating the academic experience, supporting the socio-emotional development of their students, and continue as the leading producers of Black doctors and teachers during a time when the United States needs them most.

The borrowers and advocates included a veteran father of five who was misled by a for-profit college, a recent college graduate, and a mother whose student loan debt led her to experience homelessness. The Secretary listened, asked questions of the advocates and promised to take the information he learned and the stories he heard back to the Department of Education to inform many of the future decisions regarding student loan debt. ""What I am hearing from you all is not only that there is this cloud hanging over your heads, but also that there is this great emotional impact which has severely interrupted your lives. This burden has created a generational impact of distress,"" said Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""Behind every case, there's a family, there's a person, there's a story. All of you sharing your stories helps to create a picture of what this is. There's work to be done.

30-Mar-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/department-education-announces-expansion-covid-19-emergency-flexibilities-additional-federal-student-loans-default,Department of Education Announces Expansion of COVID-19 Emergency Flexibilities to Additional Federal Student Loans in Default,"Today, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) announced an expansion of the pause on federal student loan interest and collections to all defaulted loans in the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program. This action will help more than one million additional borrowers burdened by debt during the COVID-19 emergency. “At a time when many student loan borrowers have faced economic uncertainty, we’re ensuring that relief already provided to borrowers of loans held by the Department is available to more borrowers who need the same help so they can focus on meeting their basic needs,” said Education Secretary Miguel Cardona. “Our goal is to enable these borrowers who are struggling in default to get the same protections previously made available to tens of millions of other borrowers to help weather the uncertainty of the pandemic.” Under the FFEL Program, private lenders made federal student loans to students and guaranty agencies insured these funds, which were, in turn, reinsured by the federal government. After these loans enter default, they are transferred from the lender to the guaranty agency. While some FFEL Program loans are now held by the Department because they were purchased by the federal government during the financial crisis over a decade ago, many others remain with private entities. Today, the Department is announcing that it will expand the 0% interest rate and pause of collections activity to 1.14 million borrowers who defaulted on a privately-held FFEL Program loan. This action will protect more than 800,000 borrowers who were at risk of having their federal tax refunds seized to repay a defaulted loan. This relief will be made retroactive to March 13, 2020, the start of the COVID-19 national emergency. The Department will work to automatically return any tax refunds seized or wages garnished over the past year. Borrowers who made voluntary payments on any of these loans during the past year will have the option to request a refund of those amounts. The Department will also work with the guaranty agencies, who hold these defaulted FFEL Program loans, to implement the 0% interest rate for these borrowers. In addition, any of these loans that went into default since March 13, 2020, will be returned to good standing. The guaranty agencies that hold those loans will assign them to the Department and request that the credit bureaus remove the record of default. This action builds upon steps already taken by the Biden-Harris Administration to help federal student loan borrowers. Those steps include pausing student loan interest, repayment, and collections activity for tens of millions of borrowers with loans held by the Department through Sept. 30, 2021. The Department also requested a waiver from the Small Business Administration so that individuals—despite currently or previously defaulting on federal student loans or previously being delinquent on payments—will still be eligible for a Paycheck Protection Program loan and related loan forgiveness. The waiver immediately helped nearly 30,000 small business owners."

These changes will ensure no borrowers are at risk of having their loans reinstated, meaning they would have to repay their debt—for failure to provide earnings information during the COVID-19 emergency. This action will help more than 230,000 borrowers. More than 41,000 of these borrowers who had $1.3 billion in loans reinstated will now get their discharges back, have any payments made during the COVID-19 emergency refunded, and will not be asked to submit earnings documentation. The other 190,000 borrowers who remain in their monitoring period will not be asked to submit earnings documentation. These income monitoring requirements will be waived for the duration of the COVID-19 emergency. ""Borrowers with total and permanent disabilities should focus on their well-being, not put their health on the line to submit earnings information during the COVID-19 emergency,"" said Education Secretary Miguel Cardona. ""Waiving these requirements will ensure no borrower who is totally and permanently disabled risks having to repay their loans simply because they could not submit paperwork."" The Department is providing this relief for borrowers who receive a federal student loan discharge due to total and permanent disability. Unless it is through a process with the Department of Veterans Affairs, borrowers receiving this discharge are, by regulation, subject to a three-year monitoring period. During this time, borrowers must provide the Department with information about their earnings from employment. Per regulation, borrowers whose earnings exceed certain thresholds and borrowers who do not meet certain other criteria will have their loans reinstated. However, a 2016 report by the Government Accountability Office found that 98 percent of reinstated disability discharges occurred not because earnings were too high, but because borrowers simply did not submit the requested documentation. As of today, the Department will not require borrowers who received a total and permanent disability discharge to submit earnings documentation for the duration of the COVID-19 emergency. This change will be made retroactive to March 13, 2020, the start of the COVID-19 national emergency. Additionally, the Department will reverse any reinstatement of loan repayment requirements that occurred during this period because the borrower did not submit earnings information. Impacted borrowers will not be required to later submit documentation of their income for the period covered by the COVID-19 emergency. Borrowers will begin to see their loans return to a discharge status in the coming weeks, including through follow-up communications from their servicer. The Department is considering other future changes to how it monitors earnings for those who receive a total and permanent disability discharge. Today's announcement is part of the Biden-Harris administration's continued efforts to ensure student loan borrowers receive support and protection during the COVID-19 emergency. This includes pausing interest, payments, and collection activity on the vast majority of federal student loans through at least Sept. 30, 2021. The Department also requested a waiver from the Small Business Administration to immediately help nearly 30,000 small business owners in the Paycheck Protection Program who faced difficulties because they were delinquent or in default on a federal student loan.

The summit gathered key education stakeholders from around the nation to discuss best practices on reopening schools quickly and safely. The program featured remarks from President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, First Lady of the United States Dr. Jill Biden, Secretary of Education Dr. Miguel Cardona, and Director of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention Dr. Rochelle Welensky. During the event, panels comprised of students, educators, and district leadership engaged in productive conversation centered around their strategies toward reopening and the impact the pandemic had on their in-class instruction. The summit concluded with Secretary Cardona announcing plans to implement the Summer Learning and Enrichment Collaborative, a partnership between the Department of Education, the National Governor's Association, and the Council of Chief State School Officers. During the Summit, President Biden gave remarks and expressed his support for the Collaborative: ""Today I am calling on all states, school districts, schools, community partners to work to ensure to ensure that all children have access to high quality summer learning and enrichment opportunities this summer and beyond. This is essential for all students, particularly those disproportionately impacted by the pandemic, students of color, English learners, students with disabilities, homeless students and all those who went without in-person instruction this year. The rescue plan provides the resources schools need to do this."" The Secretary also announced that he would be doing a nationwide tour of schools in order to discuss individual needs for reopening and begin the process of reimagining education together.

""I do, but I really want to focus on getting as many now in the spring,"" Cardona told Hoda Kotb on TODAY. ""I think if we continue with mitigation strategies that we know work and we utilize the American Rescue Plan funding to put in those safeguards that are needed to provide safe environments for our students, we can really continue to make the progress that we're making to get students (back in school) in the spring."" The 74: Cardona Summit Shines Light on Districts With Successful Reopening Stories and ‘Real-World Evidence' of Following CDC Guidelines U.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona will travel to local communities over the next few weeks in a continued push to get more schools to reopen before the Biden Administration's self-imposed 100-day deadline. ""My job, I can do it better if I'm listening to what is happening in the field,"" Cardona told viewers during a summit designed to highlight progress districts have made bringing students back to the classroom and to address pandemic-related learning loss. As part of those efforts, the department announced it will team up with state education chiefs and governors to support states' summer learning efforts. Under the new American Rescue Plan, states have to set aside 1 percent of the $122 billion specifically for summer learning. Education Week: Miguel Cardona Unveils Summer Learning Partnership, Releases Some COVID-19 Aid The U.S. Department of Education will join governors and state education chiefs to help create plans for summer learning and enrichment programs serving students hurt most by the coronavirus pandemic. The Summer Learning & Enrichment Collaborative will assist states, school districts, and others in planning how to use new relief funds, including the $1.2 billion earmarked for summer enrichment in the American Rescue Plan, the COVID-19 relief package signed by President Joe Biden earlier this month. Spectrum News: Dr. Jill Biden Kicks Off School Reopening Summit: ""Today is Just the Beginning"" The Department of Education hosted a ""National Safe School Reopening Summit"" on Wednesday, virtually convening district leaders, educators, and students to share knowledge on how best to go back to in-person learning amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

24-Mar-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/statement-us-secretary-education-miguel-cardona-regarding-naep-2021-school-survey,Statement from U.S Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona regarding NAEP 2021 School Survey,"“Today’s findings from the National Center for Education Statistics show encouraging early progress in states and communities’ efforts to reopen schools safely and quickly. As of February, 76% of schools were open for full-time or hybrid learning. While schools continue to show us what’s possible as they work to open their doors and meet students’ needs, we know that we still have a lot of ground to go. Data from January show there were critical gaps in access to in-person instruction, particularly for communities of color and students disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. “At the Department of Education, we are committed to working with schools all across the country to get them reopened quickly and safely and to build confidence among families and educators. We owe it to our students - especially students in underserved communities and students with disabilities - to get all our schools opened safely and to meet the social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs of all students. Between the critical funds allocated from the American Rescue Plan and the bold initiatives this Department is putting forward, I am confident that we can bridge the gaps that the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated and build a better educational system for all of our students.”"

President Biden will announce that $81 billion of American Rescue Plan (ARP) funds will be released today to all 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico to support their efforts to get students back in the classroom safely for in person learning, keep schools open once students are back, and address the academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs of all students. Secretary Cardona also will announce the launch of a new Summer Learning & Enrichment Collaborative, a partnership between the Department and the Council of Chief State School Officers and the National Governors Association, to help states use ARP funding to develop high-quality summer learning and enrichment programs for all students, with a focus on addressing the needs of student groups disproportionately affected by COVID-19. Today’s announcements are part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s broader effort to provide states, schools, and communities with the resources and support they need to return to in-person learning safely and quickly, and achieve the President’s goal of reopening the majority of K-8 schools within the first 100 days of the administration. Secretary Cardona also will announce that as part of this effort, he will travel to local school districts over the coming weeks to listen and learn from them, and to help more schools and districts in their efforts to reopen and stay open. The Secretary will then report back to the White House on what he learns. “It is my top priority to get students back in the classroom for in-person instruction safely and quickly,” said Secretary Cardona. “I continue to hear from students and educators across the country who are eager to get back to in-person learning, and these resources will help schools not only reopen safely, but also to support students who were falling behind even before the pandemic. As states and schools use American Rescue Plan funds to reopen their doors, the Department of Education is committed to helping them build successful programs that will reach students most in need this spring, summer, and into the fall.” More details about the announcements include: President Biden to Announce $81 Billion in American Rescue Plan Funding Available Today President Biden will announce that $81 billion in American Rescue Plan funds will be made available for states today to support their efforts to safely return to in-person instruction as expeditiously as possible this spring and meet the needs of all students. The American Rescue Plan’s Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ARP ESSER) fund provides $122 billion in relief for Pre-K-12 schools to reopen safely and address the academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs of their students. As of today, two-thirds of the funds—$81 billion in total—will be made available to states immediately. The Department of Education is encouraging states to develop and implement plans to immediately utilize that funding to get more schools opened safely this spring and work to close the gaps in education equity that the pandemic has exacerbated. The remainder of ARP ESSER funds will become available after states submit the plans they are developing and implementing for using ARP ESSER funds to safely reopen schools and meet the needs of students to the Department.

Summer presents a key opportunity to accelerate learning for students and provide new avenues for students to safely engage with each other and in fun activities centered around their growth and development. During the Summit, Secretary Cardona will announce the launch of the Summer Learning & Enrichment Collaborative and call on states to use ARP funding to build effective summer programs to help address the lost instructional and extracurricular time students may have experienced as a result of the pandemic, particularly for underserved communities. The Summer Learning & Enrichment Collaborative is a professional learning community that brings relevant stakeholders to the table to discuss how to build effective plans for high-quality, evidence-based summer learning and enrichment. The Collaborative, in partnership with the Council of Chief State School Officers and the National Governors Association, will launch in April 2021 and bring education leaders and experts together as they develop their plans for this summer, with a focus on students who have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. The Collaborative will help build capacity for states and school districts, in partnership with other key stakeholders, to use ARP ESSER funds to identify and implement evidence-based summer learning and enrichment strategies that meet the needs of all students. The Collaborative will build and deepen partnerships across states, districts, and among educators, parents, philanthropy, and non-profit partners to scale up and sustain successful programs. More than $1.2 billion of the ARP ESSER funds will be used by states, school districts, and schools to offer evidence-based summer learning and enrichment programs, and states and districts may use billions of dollars more for these vital programs. Secretary Cardona to Launch School Reopening Tour Secretary Cardona will also announce that he will travel to local communities in the coming weeks as part of the Department’s ongoing efforts to support states, schools, students, parents, and educators as they navigate returning to in-person learning. In the weeks following the Summit, Secretary Cardona will visit schools that have successfully reopened and stayed open to listen and learn from their experiences; he will also visit schools that are facing roadblocks and challenges as they work to reopen to provide support and technical assistance. He will meet with educators, students, and district leaders during the tour and discuss reopening strategies including implementing CDC’s recommended mitigation measures for K-12 schools, ensuring reopening efforts are advancing equity, and supporting students and communities most impacted by COVID-19. Secretary Cardona will share what he is hearing and learning on the visits with other states and districts and across the Biden-Harris Administration to help more schools reopen quickly and safely and reach the President’s goal of reopening the majority of K-8 schools within the first 100 days of his administration. His engagement with schools will help to highlight what’s working in school reopening across the country, share out key lessons with other schools who are engaged in the same effort, and help to leverage the Administration’s whole-of-government approach to COVID-19 response to make sure we are rapidly and safely accelerating toward reopening all schools. These announcements are part of a series of steps the Biden-Harris Administration has taken to help schools reopen, including releasing Volume 1 of the COVID-19 Handbook, creating a “Safer Schools and Campuses Best Practices Clearinghouse” that will be released next month, calling on states to prioritize vaccinations for Pre-K-12 teachers and staff, and directing billions in funding to states for COVID-19 screening testing for educators, students, and staff in schools."
23-Mar-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/how-us-department-education-helping-schools-reopen-safely-and-meet-needs-students,How the U.S. Department of Education is Helping Schools Reopen Safely and Meet the Needs of Students,"COVID-19 has been devastating for students and families. Despite heroic work by educators, staff, and families, the pandemic has led to increased absences, interruptions in learning opportunities and outcomes, more hungry kids and families, and more social isolation. The pandemic has exacerbated existing inequities for students from low-income backgrounds; Black, Latino, Asian, and Native American students; English learners; students with disabilities; students experiencing homelessness; and migratory students. That’s why the Biden-Harris Administration has launched an aggressive strategy to help schools reopen safely and equitably, maximize in-person instruction time, and address the academic, social, and emotional needs of students, including expanding opportunities for underserved students. Tomorrow, the Department of Education is holding a National Safe School Reopening Summit, where school districts can learn virtually from one another on successful reopening strategies and how best to close gaps in educational opportunities as they reopen their doors and get students back in the classroom. The Biden-Harris Administration has taken several steps to advance the President’s goal of reopening the majority of K-8 schools within the first 100 days of his administration: Invested $130 billion through the American Rescue Plan to help K-12 schools open quickly and safely, and serve all students The American Rescue Plan gives states and schools the resources and financial stability and certainty they need to close budget holes and avoid lay-offs, implement the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) recommended mitigation strategies, and work to close the gaps in opportunity that COVID-19 has expanded. The funds in the American Rescue Plan will enable schools to reopen safely and maintain safe in-person instruction; support students’ academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs; and advance educational equity. Last week, the Department announced the amount of funding each state will receive from the nearly $122 billion American Rescue Plan Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ARP ESSER) funds, and that those funds will begin to be distributed this month. To make and keep our schools safe, funds can be used to implement COVID-19 mitigation strategies, hire custodians and nurses, provide Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to staff and students who need it, improve ventilation, and invest in other strategies to keep students and staff safe. The American Rescue Plan goes further by ensuring schools have the resources they need to address the academic, social and emotional needs of students, particularly for underserved students and those disproportionately impacted by the pandemic, including students from low-income backgrounds, students of color, students with disabilities, English learners, students experiencing homelessness, migratory students, and students with inadequate access to technology. Resources can be used to hire counselors; provide extended learning time, summer learning and enrichment programs, tutoring, and afterschool; and invest in other evidence-based strategies that accelerate learning while addressing the significant social and emotional needs of students. Partnered with the Department of Health and Human Services to keep students, teachers, and school staff safe Released Volume 1 of the COVID-19 Handbook In February, the Department released Volume 1 of the COVID-19 Handbook, which provides educators and staff with practical examples, roadmaps, and tools to implement the CDC’s K-12 operational strategy for in-person learning, including the recommended five key mitigation measures ( Universal and correct use of masks ; Physical distancing ; Handwashing and respiratory etiquette ; Cleaning and maintaining healthy facilities; Contact tracing in combination with isolation and quarantine). The Department will release Volume 2 of the Handbook next month, which will focus on additional evidence-based strategies to address the impact of COVID-19 on students, educators, and staff, especially for underserved students and communities that have been hit hardest by the pandemic. Prioritized vaccinations of educators and school staff, and directed $10 billion in funding for screening testing at K-12 schools to ensure schools can reopen and stay open safely Earlier this month, President Biden directed all U.S. states and territories to prioritize vaccinations of teachers and staff in Pre-K-12 schools and childcare providers, with the goal of providing these frontline essential workers with at least one dose of a vaccine by the end of March. Last week, the Department of Health and Human Services also announced that CDC would provide $10 billion in funding for COVID-19 screening testing for teachers, staff, and students in K-12 schools. By expanding access to vaccinations and testing for educators and school staff, more schools will be able to safely and quickly reopen, and more students, particularly those in underserved and under-resourced communities, will be able to return to in-person instruction. Launched a “Safer Schools and Campuses Best Practices Clearinghouse” and webinar series. The Clearinghouse will highlight lessons learned and best practices that can help schools and districts best use American Rescue Plan funds to meet their students’ unique needs. The Clearinghouse will include resources that not only help schools prepare for and sustain in-person operations safely but also will help schools meet students’ social, emotional, mental health, academic, and other needs, including access to food and other basic needs that have been exacerbated by the pandemic. The Clearinghouse will also include resources on strategies to address the trauma that students, teachers, faculty, and staff have endured during the pandemic and the resulting economic, mental health, and emotional impacts. Tomorrow’s summit will include remarks by President Biden and Vice President Harris, welcome remarks by First Lady Dr. Jill Biden, and remarks by Secretary of Education Dr. Miguel Cardona, and CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky. Attendees will also hear from Learning Policy Institute President and CEO Dr. Linda Darling-Hammond, students, educators, and representatives from districts across the country. During the Summit, participants will discuss successful reopening plans and how to use American Rescue Plan funds to implement CDC’s recommended mitigation strategies, close gaps in educational opportunities for underserved students who have been most impacted by the pandemic, and address the social and emotional needs of students. The Summit will be livestreamed on the Department of Education’s YouTube channel ."

These funds include $390 million under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund (ESSER I) and the Governor's Emergency Education Relief Fund (GEER I). The funds also include all fiscal year 2019 Department program grant funds totaling $522 million, including funds under Title I, Part A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended, and Part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. The release of funds marks a commitment from the Department and the Biden Administration in supporting Puerto Rico as the Commonwealth recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic and recent natural disasters that have impacted students, families, and educators across the island. In the letter to Governor Pierluisi, Secretary Cardona stated: ""As we renew our partnership with the Puerto Rico Department of Education (PRDE), I wish to affirm my commitment, and the Department's commitment, to supporting Puerto Rico and PRDE in a collaborative and mutually respectful manner, with the shared objective of benefitting the students of the Commonwealth.

The funds released today are now immediately available for use by the Commonwealth. As part of the Department's commitment to expand equitable access to education, the Department will work with Puerto Rico to identify how these funds may best be used to address the academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs of students in Puerto Rico. The Department is also committed to working in partnership with Puerto Rico to put in place enhanced oversight and accountability measures to ensure that these essential resources result in impactful programs and services for the students of the Commonwealth, and are spent in compliance with the applicable laws and other requirements."

New assistance to institutions regarding use of COVID-19 relief funds Today, the Department is issuing guidance regarding the use of funds received under the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF) grant program. The new HEERF guidance reflects a change in the Department's prior position, which previously only allowed funds received under the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2021 (CRRSAA), to be used for costs incurred on or after Dec. 27, 2020, the date of the enactment of the CRRSAA. ""The comprehensive and clear guidance on the use of HEERF grants will enable colleges and universities to better address the academic needs of their students, as well as ensure the safety and well-being of all members of the campus community,"" said Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""One of my first priorities is to ensure that institutions of higher education have the financial support and resources needed to support their students and mitigate the challenges brought on by the COVID-19 emergency. Our latest actions will help campuses address those challenges."" The Department is also supplementing this change of interpretation with additional guidance about how grantees may calculate and charge ""lost revenue"" to their HEERF awards, as well as the release of additional Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) for the Public and Private Nonprofit Institution Grants and Proprietary Institution Grant Funds for Students. The updated guidance will: Emphasize support for students with exceptional needs: The pandemic affects all students and has exacerbated the inequities within our educational system. This guidance makes it clear colleges can make financial aid grants to dual enrollment, continuing education, non-degree seeking, or non-credit students, as well as to a broad range of students with exceptional needs, such as certain refugees or persons granted asylum. Empower institutions to use their grants to discharge student debts and support student services: In addition to the grants made directly to students, this guidance illustrates opportunities for institutions to use their own grants to reimburse themselves for lost revenue while supporting students during the pandemic, including discharging unpaid institutional balances so students can resume their studies and subsidizing childcare services for student parents. Expand flexibilities for student and institution needs brought on by the pandemic: To address a myriad of academic and safety concerns, the new guidance provides college leaders with flexibility on the use of funds. Colleges will be permitted to use HEERF grant funds to reimburse themselves for institutional lost revenue and expenses incurred as far back as Mar. 13, 2020, the start of the national emergency. More information about the guidance can be found in the Notice of Interpretation , Lost Revenue FAQs , and updates to existing FAQs . Direct outreach to students eligible for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits Today, the Department informed postsecondary institutions they can conduct direct outreach to students who may meet temporarily expanded eligibility criteria for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The Department's office of Federal Student Aid will soon begin its own direct outreach to students to tell them about the temporary program changes and how to apply. These efforts—in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Agriculture—align with President Biden's Jan. 22 Executive Order directing all federal agencies to address the economic crisis resulting from the COVID-19 emergency. ""Many students have had their postsecondary careers turned upside down as they manage their schoolwork while also protecting themselves from this virus. On top of that, many college students have also had to deal with food insecurity,"" said Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""This direct outreach from the Department is an attempt to get every eligible college student to apply for these benefits so that they no longer have to worry about their next meal. We hope every eligible student takes advantage of these benefits while continuing to focus on their studies."" Under regular SNAP eligibility requirements, students enrolled at least half-time in an institution of higher education are typically ineligible for SNAP benefits unless they meet certain specific exemptions. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 temporarily expands SNAP eligibility to include students who either: Are eligible to participate in state or federally financed work study during the regular academic year, as determined by the institution of higher education; or Have an expected family contribution (EFC) of 0 in the current academic year. This includes students who are eligible for a maximum Pell Grant Beginning Jan. 16, 2021, students who meet one of the two criteria outlined above may receive SNAP benefits if they meet all other financial and non-financial SNAP eligibility criteria. The new, temporary exemptions will be in effect until 30 days after the COVID-19 public health emergency is lifted. More information can be found on the SNAP benefits for students webpage and Q&A on student eligibility. Because state SNAP agencies administer the SNAP program, process applications, and determine eligibility, students should contact their local SNAP offices to learn how to apply or to ask other questions."
18-Mar-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/department-education-announces-action-streamline-borrower-defense-relief-process,Department of Education Announces Action to Streamline Borrower Defense Relief Process,"Today, the U.S. Department of Education (Department) announced it will streamline debt relief determinations for borrowers with claims approved to date that their institution engaged in certain misconduct. The Department will be rescinding the formula for calculating partial relief and adopting a streamlined approach for granting full relief under the regulations to borrower defense claims approved to date. The Department anticipates this change will ultimately help approximately 72,000 borrowers receive $1 billion in loan cancellation. “Borrowers deserve a simplified and fair path to relief when they have been harmed by their institution’s misconduct,” said Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “A close review of these claims and the associated evidence showed these borrowers have been harmed and we will grant them a fresh start from their debt.” Current provisions in federal law called ""borrower defense to repayment"" or ""borrower defense"" allow federal borrowers to seek cancellation of their William D. Ford Direct Loan (Direct Loan) Program loans if their institution engaged in certain misconduct. Beginning today, the Department will ensure that borrowers with approved borrower defense claims to date will have a streamlined path to receiving full loan discharges. This includes borrowers with previously approved claims that received less than a full loan discharge. Full relief under the regulations will include: 100 percent discharge of borrowers’ related federal student loans. Reimbursement of any amounts paid on the loans, where appropriate under the regulations. Requests to credit bureaus to remove any related negative credit reporting. And, Reinstatement of federal student aid eligibility, if applicable. This new approach replaces a methodology first announced in December 2019 to determine the amount of relief granted to borrowers with approved claims. After completing a comprehensive review of that methodology, the Department determined that it did not result in an appropriate relief determination. This is the Department’s first step in addressing borrower defense claims as well as the underlying regulations. The Department will be pursuing additional actions, including re-regulation, in the future. The Department will begin applying this new approach today and affected borrowers will receive notices from the Department over the next several weeks with discharges following after that. Updated information for borrowers will be posted to StudentAid.gov/borrower-defense ."
17-Mar-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/department-education-announces-american-rescue-plan-funds-all-50-states-puerto-rico-and-district-columbia-help-schools-reopen,"Department of Education Announces American Rescue Plan Funds for All 50 States, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia to Help Schools Reopen","Today, less than a week after President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan (ARP), the U.S. Department of Education (Department) announced the amount of ARP Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) funding that each State, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia will receive to support their efforts to reopen K-12 schools safely this month and equitably expand opportunity for students who need it most. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona delivered the news directly to state education commissioners in a letter issued today and said the Department will begin to make these funds available to state educational agencies (SEAs) this month. The announcement coincides with the Department of Health and Human Services' announcement that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will provide $10 billion to states to support COVID-19 screening testing for K-12 teachers, staff, and students in schools, and marks swift action by the Biden-Harris Administration to meet the President's goal of safely reopening the majority of K-8 schools within the first 100 days of his administration. ""This pandemic has taken an extraordinary toll on students, parents, educators, and schools, and we know that our schools, students, and communities need help now to reopen safely and quickly, and to stay open,"" said Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""These funds from the American Rescue Plan and the extraordinary steps the Department is taking to get these resources to states quickly will allow schools to invest in mitigation strategies to get students back in the classroom and stay there, and address the many impacts this pandemic has had on students—especially those disproportionately impacted by the pandemic."" The Department announced the allocation that each SEA will receive under the American Rescue Plan Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ARP ESSER) Fund, totaling $122 billion in relief for K-12 schools. The Department will begin to make these funds available this month so that they may act to fund health and safety measures consistent with CDC guidance, address the disruptions to teaching and learning resulting from the pandemic—especially for students hardest hit by the pandemic—and get students back in the classroom quickly and safely. In his letter, Secretary Cardona urged states and school districts to utilize these funds with the same sense of urgency the President and Congress used to pass the American Rescue Plan Act and with the same commitment that families and educators have to getting students back in classrooms for in-person instruction safely. The ARP ESSER funds may be used to address the many impacts of COVID-19 on pre-K through 12 education, including: Investing in resources to implement CDC's K-12 operational strategy for in-person learning to keep educators, staff, and students safe; improving ventilation; purchasing personal protective equipment (PPE); and obtaining additional space to ensure social distancing in classrooms. Avoiding devastating layoffs and hiring additional educators to address learning loss, providing support to students and existing staff, and providing sufficient staffing to facilitate social distancing. Implementing strategies to meet the social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs of students hit hardest by the pandemic, including through evidence-based interventions and critical services like community schools. Funding crucial summer, afterschool, and other extended learning and enrichment programs. Hiring additional school personnel, such as nurses and custodial staff, to keep schools safe and healthy. Providing for social distancing and safety protocols on buses. Funding for Wi-Fi hotspots and devices for students without connectivity for remote learning and supporting educators in the effective use of technology; and Additional uses as allowed in the statute. Secretary Cardona also underscored the importance of advancing equity in states' efforts to reopen schools quickly and safely. The Secretary encouraged states to make sure students who have been hit hardest by COVID-19 are provided with the resources and support they need to emerge from this pandemic stronger. American Rescue Plan funds can be used by SEAs and school districts to equitably expand opportunities for students who need the funds most, including students from low-income backgrounds, students of color, students with disabilities, English learners, students experiencing homelessness, and students with inadequate access to technology. Secretary Cardona also reaffirmed the Department's ongoing commitment to providing technical assistance, guidance, and best practices to states as they work to utilize these funds. The below table outlines the amount of funding each SEA will receive from the ARP ESSER Fund.

17-Mar-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/department-education-host-national-safe-school-reopening-summit-wednesday-march-24,"Department of Education to Host National Safe School Reopening Summit on Wednesday, March 24","Following the passage of the American Rescue Plan recently signed by President Biden, the U.S. Department of Education (ED) announced more details today regarding the virtual National Safe School Reopening Summit, which will take place on Wednesday, March 24, 2021 at 12pm EDT. The summit program will include welcoming remarks from First Lady Dr. Jill Biden as well as remarks from Secretary of Education Dr. Miguel A. Cardona, and the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Dr. Rochelle Walensky. It will also consist of three panels that will include health experts, educators and education leaders, and students. ""Since day one, my top priority, and a top priority for President Biden and Vice President Harris, has been to get kids safely back into schools full time. To accomplish this, we need to bring together students, educators, and school district leaders to listen and learn from one another as we work together to reopen schools quickly, safely, and equitably, and address the academic, social and emotional needs of our students,"" said Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""We are holding this Summit with the goal of sharing best practices and connecting leaders, educators, and students from across this country who are navigating this challenge together and finding creative solutions to support our students and bring them back to in-person learning. And we need to make sure we are listening to communities who have been hit the hardest by the pandemic. The time is now, and schools across the country must act immediately to get students safely back into school buildings."" The sessions of the Summit include: Lessons from the Field: Implementing CDC's K-12 Operational Strategy to Keep Students, Educators, and Staff Safe Leaders and other representatives of school districts will highlight effective school reopening approaches that have a focus on collaboration and equity. Technical Assistance from CDC and ED: Implementing CDC's Guidance to Keep Students, Educators, and Staff Safe Technical experts from CDC and ED will discuss CDC's K-12 Operational Strategy, ED's COVID-19 Implementation Handbook, and other resources; answer common question; and clarify misconceptions. Supporting All Students: Addressing the Academic, Social, and Emotional Needs of Students with a Focus on Equity Leaders and other representatives of school districts will share promising strategies to support the social, emotional, and academic development needs of students, with a particular focus on students who have been historically underserved and who have experienced the greatest disruption from the pandemic. The Summit is one of a series of steps the Department is taking to provide support and resources to schools as they work to reopen quickly and safely. Last month, the Department released the first volume of the COVID-19 Handbook, which provided educators and staff with practical examples, roadmaps, and tools to implement CDC's K-12 operational strategy for in-person learning, including the recommended five key mitigation measures. The Department plans to release Volume 2 of the Handbook in April. Earlier this month, President Biden also directed all U.S. states and territories to prioritize vaccinations of teachers and staff in Pre-K-12 schools and childcare providers throughout this month, with the goal of all providing these frontline essential workers with at least one dose of a vaccine by the end of March. More details about the National Safe School Reopening Summit, including registration information, will be released by the Department in the coming days."
12-Mar-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-continues-aggressive-plan-safely-reopen-schools,U.S. Department of Education Continues Aggressive Plan to Safely Reopen Schools,"Following President Biden's signing the American Rescue Plan into law, the U.S. Department of Education announced additional details on its plans to support schools in safely returning to in-person instruction. The Department of Education will provide best practices, guidance, and support to schools as they navigate reopening, while the American Rescue Plan will provide $130 billion to help schools implement these safe reopening measures and address the academic, social, and emotional needs of students. These efforts are part of U.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona's priority to support schools, campuses, and students across the country and were outlined in President Biden's Executive Order on Supporting the Reopening and Continuing Operation of Schools and Early Childhood Education Providers . ""Students learn best in schools,"" Secretary Cardona said. ""Our top priority is to make sure America's schools continue to reopen as safely and as quickly as possible, and our job is to provide states, districts, educators, and families with the resources they need to do so. Now that the American Rescue Plan has been signed into law, we can get states and districts additional funding to reopen safely and address the needs of students. These actions will provide schools, educators, and families with additional support to make sure our students and communities emerge from this challenge stronger."" While Cardona recognizes that there's no one-size-fits-all solution to reopening schools, the Department will work with state and local communities to ensure schools and campuses are quickly able to access and utilize funds from the American Rescue Plan and know how to utilize them to support their reopening efforts and address the needs of students. Today's announcements include additional information on the steps the Department is taking to help schools and communities share best practices around reopening and how to implement effective solutions. The Department will convene a virtual National Safe School Reopening Summit this month to share best practices, discuss successful mitigation and reopening strategies, and learn from students, educators, and other experts. The Summit will offer a forum for researchers and practitioners to discuss strategies for addressing the social, emotional, and academic needs of students—with a focus on those students most underserved—as many schools across the country continue their work to safely reopen. It will also feature experts from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Department of Education who will discuss how schools can safely reopen and how the Biden Administration is providing support and resources to schools, educators, and students as they work to reopen safely and address student needs. The Department is launching the ""Safer Schools and Campuses Best Practices Clearinghouse"" called for in President Biden's Executive Order, starting with the ""Lessons from the Field"" webinar series. The Clearinghouse will highlight lessons learned and best practices that can help schools and districts identify opportunities to best utilize American Rescue Plan funds to meet their unique needs. The Clearinghouse will include resources that target the needs of students and teachers, faculty and staff in early childhood programs, K-12 schools, and colleges and universities in three main areas: Safe and Healthy Environments: School and campus approaches to implementing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) recommended mitigation strategies and preparing for and sustaining in-person operations safely. Providing Supports to Students: School and campus strategies to meet student social, emotional, mental health, academic, financial, and other needs, including access to food and other basic needs. Teacher, Faculty, and Staff Well-Being, Professional Development, and Supports: School and campus strategies to address the social, emotional, health, and other needs of teachers, faculty, and staff. The Clearinghouse's ""Lessons from the Field"" webinar series will begin on March 31. The Department welcomes lessons learned and best practices from the field for consideration for the Clearinghouse, including those with an educational equity focus. Submissions should be sent via email to: Bestpracticesclearinghouse@ed.gov . Please visit https://bestpracticesclearinghouse.ed.gov/ for more information about the Clearinghouse. The Department will release Volume 2 of the K-12 COVID-19 Handbook for districts, schools, and educators in early April. This volume will provide research-based strategies to address the impact of COVID-19 on students, educators, and staff, especially for historically underserved students and communities that have been hit hardest by the pandemic. In February, the Department released the first volume of the COVID-19 Handbook, which provided educators and staff with practical examples, roadmaps, and tools to implement CDC's K-12 operational strategy for in-person learning, including the recommended five key mitigation measures. Since the release of Volume 1, the Department and CDC have transmitted the handbook and offered technical assistance to educators; state and local elected officials in every state and territory, including governors, chief state school officers, state boards of education, state legislative leaders and staff, mayors, and superintendents; and thousands of stakeholder organizations across the country. In addition to the American Rescue Plan, these actions are key parts of the Biden Administration's national strategy to provide states, early childhood providers, schools, districts, and campuses with the support and resources they need to reopen safely for in-person instruction. Last week, the President also directed all U.S. states and territories to prioritize vaccinations of teachers and staff in Pre-K-12 schools and childcare providers throughout this month, with the goal of all providing these frontline essential workers with at least one vaccine dose by the end of March."

23-Feb-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/education-department-amplifies-usda-expansion-snap-benefits-help-students-pursuing-postsecondary-education-during-pandemic,Education Department Amplifies USDA Expansion of SNAP Benefits to Help Students Pursuing Postsecondary Education During Pandemic,"As part of its ongoing efforts to ease the economic burden on millions of Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. Department of Education—in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)—issued guidance to postsecondary institutions to inform them about temporarily expanded Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) eligibility for students in need. ""Since the onset of this pandemic, college students already living with low incomes have experienced significant life disruptions including increased food insecurity,"" said Acting Assistant Secretary for Postsecondary Education Michelle Asha Cooper. ""No student should have to worry about where their next meal will come from while balancing their studies. Informing eligible students of these benefits can help ease that uncertainty."" The guidance encourages institutions of higher education to coordinate with campus stakeholders to notify eligible students. Today's action follows Jan. 29 guidance reminding institutions that they have the authority to adjust financial aid packages to account for students' and families' current financial circumstances. These outreach efforts align with President Biden's Jan. 22 Executive Order directing all federal agencies to address the economic crisis resulting from the pandemic. ""This health and economic crisis has left millions out of work or struggling to cover basic expenses. We are pleased to work with our partners at the Department of Education, to help inform students about the recent expansion of SNAP eligibility for low-income students,"" said USDA Deputy Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services Stacy Dean. ""The guidance issued today is part of the Biden Administration's push to act quickly to address hunger and support those who are struggling."" Under regular SNAP eligibility requirements, students enrolled at least half-time in an institution of higher education are typically ineligible for SNAP benefits unless they meet certain specific exemptions. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 temporarily expands SNAP eligibility to include students who either: Are eligible to participate in state or federally financed work study during the regular academic year, as determined by the institution of higher education; or Have an expected family contribution (EFC) of 0 in the current academic year. This includes students who are eligible for a maximum Pell Grant. Beginning Jan. 16, 2021, students who meet one of the two criteria outlined above may receive SNAP benefits if they meet all other financial and non-financial SNAP eligibility criteria. The new, temporary exemptions will be in effect until 30 days after the COVID-19 public health emergency is lifted. More information can be found on the SNAP benefits for students webpage and Q&A on student eligibility . Because state SNAP agencies administer the SNAP program, process applications, and determine eligibility, students should contact their local SNAP offices to learn how to apply or to ask other questions. Institutions of higher education with questions about student SNAP eligibility, including the temporary expansion, should contact their state SNAP agency. Contact information for state SNAP agencies and local offices can be found in the FNS SNAP state directory ."
22-Feb-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-releases-guidance-states-assessing-student-learning-during-pandemic,U.S. Department of Education Releases Guidance to States on Assessing Student Learning During the Pandemic,"Today, the U.S. Department of Education (ED) is providing guidance to states emphasizing the importance of flexibility in administering assessments this year as a result of the pandemic and supporting the use of assessment data as a source of information for parents and educators to target resources and support, rather than for accountability purposes this year. State assessments and accountability systems play an important role in advancing educational equity, identifying student needs, and targeting the resources to address them. At the same time, some schools and districts may not be able to safely administer statewide summative assessments this spring using their standard practices, while others may wish to prioritize learning time during the scant in-person schooling time this year in many communities. The pandemic requires that states have significant flexibility in implementing this work for the 2020-2021 school year and ED's guidance is a practical approach that balances these two priorities. ""The Department of Education is committed to supporting all states in assessing student learning during the pandemic to help target resources and support to the students with the greatest needs,"" said Ian Rosenblum, acting assistant secretary for elementary and secondary education. ""We also recognize that at a time when everything in our education system is different, there need to be different ways that states can administer state tests like moving them to the fall so that precious in-person learning time this year can be spent on instruction. Balancing these priorities is the best approach."" ED's guidance makes clear that states should consider the ways they can do things differently this year. Flexibility available to states includes: Extending the testing window and moving assessments to the summer or fall, Giving the assessment remotely, where feasible, Shortening the state assessment, to make testing more feasible to implement and prioritize in-person learning time. The Department also recognizes that individual states may need additional assessment flexibility based on the specific circumstances across or within the state. ED is prepared to work with states to address their individual needs and conditions while ensuring the maximum available statewide data to inform the targeting of resources and support. In addition to encouraging flexibility around assessments, ED is allowing states to request a waiver for the Every Student Succeeds Act's accountability and school identification requirements. This flexibility will explicitly include waiving the accountability provisions relating to having a 95 percent test participation rate. The Department's letter to Chief State School Officers outlining its plans for the 2020-2021 school year can be found here . ""States are working hard to respond to the unique circumstances they are facing and maintain their immediate focus on supporting students' social, emotional, and academic development,"" said Jessica Cardichon, deputy assistant secretary of K-12, Office of Planning, Evaluation, and Policy Development. ""In addition to this guidance, the Administration is working with Congress to secure the additional resources in the American Rescue Plan that are needed to support states and districts in safely reopening schools and responding to the long-term impact of COVID on students and educators."" The steps taken today by the Department of Education reflect a practical approach for addressing the immediate crisis at hand. The Department will continue to engage a broad range of stakeholders regarding how the Biden-Harris Administration can best implement its agenda to prepare all students to succeed in the tomorrow's economy, regardless of race, parents' income, zip code, or disability; and to provide educators with the support, respect and dignity they deserve. President Biden's proposed American Rescue Plan calls for $130 billion in funding to help schools safely reopen and meet the unique needs students and educators are facing during the pandemic, including supporting the academic, social, and emotional needs of students."
12-Feb-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-covid-19-handbook-volume-1-strategies-safely-reopening-elementary-and-secondary-schools,U.S. Department of Education COVID-19 Handbook Volume 1: Strategies for Safely Reopening Elementary and Secondary Schools,"To reopen safely during the COVID-19 pandemic and maximize the amount of in-person instruction, schools need sufficient resources as well as adhered-to, strong state and local public health measures. Extraordinary efforts by states, districts, and schools have been underway to support students throughout the pandemic. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Department of Education (ED) are providing recommendations and considerations based on the most recent scientific evidence to support school and district leaders and educators in meeting these ever evolving, significant challenges. Consistent implementation of mitigation strategies during all school-related activities is critical for reopening schools – and keeping them open. To that end, ED is releasing the COVID-19 Handbook , which provides strategies to do this and also identifies ways to promote equity for communities of color and people with disabilities/chronic conditions who have borne a disproportionate burden of illness and serious outcomes from COVID-19. The ED COVID-19 Handbook will support the education community with implementation guidance, strategies, and considerations to help reopen schools safely. The handbook is being released in two volumes. First Volume of the ED COVID-19 Handbook The first volume supplements CDC's Operational Strategy for K-12 Schools through Phased Mitigation . ED's handbook provides practical examples and roadmaps to provide educators and staff with the tools they need to implement CDC's recommended safe practices for in-person learning. Highlights include: Masking Practices The handbook provides applicable strategies to promote universal and correct use of masks in schools by utilizing signage and school announcements to remind students and staff how to use masks. The handbook guides educators through working with students with disabilities who cannot wear a mask or safely wear a mask, consistent with CDC guidelines. Physical Distancing Practices The ED handbook details a variety of practical ways that educators and schools can practice physical distancing to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, including: Grouping students into a pod that stays together all day with their core teacher (and any aide or student teacher who is present), including for lunch and recess. Using cafeterias and auditoriums for classes. Staggering the use of communal spaces and reconfiguring bell schedules to minimize foot traffic. For transportation to school, seating one student per row and assigning each bus rider to a designated seat that is the same every day. Roadmap for Stakeholder Engagement A successful school reopening strategy requires engaging the entire school community to promote actions that will lead to a safe learning environment for all educators, staff, and students. ED's handbook lays out a roadmap for who should be at the table and suggests ways that school leaders and educators can conduct individual outreach activities and use surveys and virtual town halls to engage the community in an effort to reopen schools. Second Volume of the ED COVID-19 Handbook The second volume of the ED COVID-19 Handbook, which will be released in the coming weeks, will provide specific strategies to address the extraordinary disruption created by COVID-19 for students, educators, and parents — especially for historically underserved students and communities that preliminary data suggest have been hit hardest by the pandemic. These strategies will be tailored around the following topics: Meeting the social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs of students. Supporting educator and school staff well-being. Addressing lost instructional time for students. Stabilizing a diverse and qualified educator workforce. Ensuring equitable access to broadband and the devices needed to participate in remote learning. Supporting the effective use of technology for in-person learning and periodic shifts to remote learning. Providing school nutrition, regardless of the educational setting. Providing all students with access to a safe and inclusive learning environment. Extending learning time. Addressing resource inequities to provide all students with the educational opportunities they need to succeed, including access to a well-rounded education (including advanced courses, music, and the arts), quality educators, and integrated student support services. Using data to inform students, parents, and educators of progress and areas requiring additional support."
5-Feb-21,https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/ed-announces-national-survey-gather-critical-data-school-reopening,ED Announces National Survey to Gather Critical Data on School Reopening,"To help safely reopen America's schools and promote educational equity, the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) at the U.S. Department of Education today announced the largest representative and highest-quality effort yet to gather vital data on the impact of COVID-19 on students and the status of in-person learning. Currently, there is not enough data to understand the status of school re-opening and how students are learning nationwide. This project, known as the ""NAEP 2021 School Survey,"" will collect high-quality data from a nationally and state-representative sample. Today's announcement follows President Biden's Jan. 21 Executive Order to ensure ""the collection of data necessary to fully understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on students and educators, including data on the status of in-person learning. These data shall be disaggregated by student demographics, including race, ethnicity, disability, English-language-learner status, and free or reduced lunch status or other appropriate indicators of family income."" IES's National Center for Education Statistics – the highest-quality education data source in the nation – will oversee the survey collection, which is designed to collect vital data with the least possible burden on schools. Data gathered in the survey will include: The share of the nation's schools that are open with full-time in-person instruction, open with online and in-person instruction, or fully remote. Enrollment by instructional mode by race/ethnicity, socio-economic status, English learner status, and disability status. Attendance rates by instructional mode by race/ethnicity, socio-economic status, English learner status, disability status, and housing status. Frequency of in-person learning for students. Average number of hours of synchronous instruction for students in remote instruction mode. And, Student groups prioritized by schools for in-person instruction by selected school characteristics. ""It's critically important to get a sense of how students are learning,"" said James Lynn Woodworth, commissioner of the National Center for Education Statistics. ""NCES will use this data to both provide the most accurate immediate view about school operating statuses and to better interpret the impact of current school operations on the results of the NAEP assessments scheduled to be conducted in 2022."" ""President Biden is committed to the safe reopening of schools and to addressing the educational disparities and inequities that the pandemic has exposed and exacerbated,"" said Ian Rosenblum, acting assistant secretary of the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education. ""To do that, we need more information about how students are learning during this pandemic – and we simply don't have it right now. The administration, educators, parents, and education leaders need meaningful data in order to achieve these critical goals and this survey will give them that."" The survey will collect data from approximately 3,500 schools that enroll fourth-graders and an equal number of schools that enroll eighth-graders. The public will have access to the highest-quality data about school reopenings for in-person instruction and how students are learning. Results will be collected monthly beginning this month and running through June, and key findings will be reported. The study will maximize the use of federal dollars by utilizing the existing online data collection systems and infrastructure used for the Nation's Report Card, also known as NAEP."
