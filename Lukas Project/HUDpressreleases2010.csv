01/12/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-003.cfm,HUD Announces Agreement with Lake County Housing Authority to End Discrimination Complaint and Keep Elderly Family Together,"WASHINGTON - Two elderly sisters will continue living together under an agreement announced today by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Lake County Housing Authority (LCHA) in Grayslake, Illinois.
The agreement settles a housing discrimination complaint brought by John Marshall Law School Fair Housing Legal Clinic on behalf of the sisters. In addition, the housing authority will pay $20,000 to each sister, $20,000 to the law school, and forgive up to $10,000 in disputed past due rent.
""We are absolutely delighted these sisters can remain together as a family,"" said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Today, more and more people face the challenges of caring for their loved ones. The Fair Housing Act means that landlords should make reasonable accommodations - in this case, by allowing the care giving sister to stay in their home.""
In November of 2008, an elderly, developmentally disabled tenant filed a discrimination complaint with HUD alleging that the Lake County Housing Authority failed to provide her reasonable accommodation, as required by the Fair Housing Act. The tenant is a participant in the HUD's Housing Choice Voucher Program (Section 8) and lives with her sister, who acts as her live-in caregiver. LCHA's rental policy did not allow family members to serve as live-in caregivers. As a reasonable accommodation to the family, the housing authority will allow the elderly resident's sister to live in the unit as her caregiver and will adjust her monthly rent based on this new policy.
HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity and its partners in the Fair Housing Assistance Program investigate more than 10,000 housing discrimination complaints annually. People who believe they are the victims of housing discrimination should contact HUD at 1-800-669-9777 (voice), 800-927-9275 (TTY). Additional information is available at www.hud.gov/fairhousing."
01/12/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-004.cfm,"HUD Awards Nearly $12 Million in Grants to Housing Authorities to Help Public Housing Residents Obtain Jobs, Economic Independence","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today awarded $11,980,088 in grants to more than 200 public housing authorities across the U.S. to help public housing residents find jobs that lead them toward economic independence. For information on local funding amounts, visit HUD's website.
The grants are provided through HUD's Public and Indian Housing Family Self-Sufficiency Program, which enables public housing authorities (PHAs) to hire program coordinators who work directly with residents to connect them with local education and training opportunities; job placement organizations; and local employers. The purpose of the program is to encourage local innovative strategies that link public housing assistance with public and private resources to enable participating families to increase earned income; reduce or eliminate the need for welfare assistance; and make progress toward achieving economic independence and housing self-sufficiency.
""Families who complete this program accomplish the milestones that improve an individual's quality of life - a new job or professional certification,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan, who announced the grants today. ""Most importantly, these families get the courage and confidence to succeed.""
Participating public housing residents sign a contract to participate, which outlines their responsibilities towards completion of training and employment objectives over a five-year period. For those families receiving welfare assistance, the PHA must establish an interim goal that the participating family be independent from welfare assistance prior to the expiration of the contract. During their participation, residents may create an escrow account funded with their increasing income, which they may use in a variety of ways, including continuing their education or making major purchase. A HUD study found low-income families who participated in this program saw their incomes increase at a higher rate than non-participants. According to the study, between 1996 and 2000, FSS participants experienced a 72 percent increase in their median income, from $6,936 to $11,960. Among non-FSS participants, the increase was half as large, at 36 percent."
01/12/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-005.cfm,HUD Inspector General Probes Mortgage Companies with Significant Claim Rates,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Inspector General Kenneth M. Donohue and Federal Housing Administration (FHA) Commissioner David H. Stevens announced today an initiative focusing on mortgage companies with significant claim rates against the Federal Housing Administration mortgage insurance program. HUD Office of Inspector General (OIG) subpoenas were served to the corporate offices of 15 mortgage companies across the country demanding documents and data related to failed loans which resulted in claims paid out by the FHA mortgage insurance fund. Inspector General Donohue said, ""The goal of this initiative is to determine why there is such a high rate of defaults and claims with these companies and whether there is wrongdoing involved. We aren't making any accusations at this time, we have no evidence of wrongdoing, but we will aggressively pursue indicators of fraud. We are members of the President's Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force and today's activities reflect our commitment to seeking information on red flags that may arise from data analysis."" ""This initiative was prompted, in part, by the FHA Commissioner, David Stevens, who was alarmed by the incidence of claims against the FHA insurance fund by a number of poor performing companies and reached out to the HUD OIG for assistance."" FHA Commissioner David Stevens said, ""We are taking risk management extremely seriously. In addition to the policy changes we are implementing and additional changes we plan to announce later this month, we need to hold FHA lenders accountable for the high rates of defaults and claims against FHA. The Inspector General's initiative will help us determine whether there is fraud and better manage risk in the long run."" ""The HUD OIG identified these direct endorsement companies from an analysis of loan data focusing on companies with a significant number of claims, a certain loan underwriting volume, a high ratio of defaults and claims compared to the national average, and claims that occurred earlier in the life of the mortgage. These are key indicators of problems at the origination or underwriting stages. The HUD OIG wants to see why these loans failed."" ""Some actions available to the HUD OIG are audits, investigations, and inspections and evaluations. In addition, we rely on the support of the Department of Justice (DoJ), and of State and local law enforcement. The DoJ is available to pursue both civil and criminal legal actions against wrongdoers. HUD is available to proceed with administrative sanctions such as suspensions, limited denial of participation, debarment, and civil monetary penalties."" ""The probe will be conducted by the HUD OIG's Audit and Investigation staff jointly. They will assess why these companies have high default rates, especially at this unprecedented time when the FHA mortgage insurance program represents such a significant percentage of mortgages currently in force in our country."" ""This probe is a new type of approach in which HUD OIG is focused on corporate offices rather than individual branch offices. This is a starting point for more detailed reviews if abuses are uncovered, and the HUD OIG anticipates that more probes may follow."" ""The FHA market share has skyrocketed,"" Inspector General Donohue further said. ""Our job is oversight. We work for the American taxpayer. Each loan on this list will be thoroughly examined and we will track down the reasons why it failed. Once we determine the causes, we will look to see whether there is a need for further review or remedial action. We want to send a message to the industry that as the mortgage landscape has shifted we are watching very carefully and that we are poised to take action against bad performers.""
The following companies were served OIG subpoenas today:

HUD and Alaska DOI claim Alyeska paid a sham employee for referring consumers to the title company. Under the terms of the settlement announced today, the Company agrees to cease the alleged sham employment arrangement and will pay up to $155,000 to the U.S. government and the State of Alaska. ""Consumers are the ones who ultimately foot the bill from unethical practices in mortgage transactions,"" said David H. Stevens, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Housing and Federal Housing Commissioner. ""Working closely with our partners in Alaska, we hope this settlement will send a clear message that we have zero tolerance for unethical behavior in mortgage lending."" Linda Hall, Director of the Alaska Division of Insurance said, ""This action should serve as a warning that we expect strict adherence to both RESPA provisions and Alaska insurance statutes and regulations by those involved in the title insurance and real estate industry."" After a joint investigation, HUD and Alaska DOI alleged that since at least 2003, Alyeska maintained a sham employment arrangement with Kirk Wickersham, owner of FSBO System, Inc. HUD and Alaska DOI allege Wickersham, as a ""title marketer,"" was paid a percentage of Alyeska's title insurance premiums in exchange for referrals he made to Alyeska. Section 8 of RESPA prohibits a person from giving or accepting anything of value in exchange for the referral of settlement service business. RESPA also prohibits a person from giving or accepting any part of a charge for services that are not performed. Likewise, the State of Alaska's anti-rebating statute (AS § 21.66.310) prohibits title companies and their agents from giving anything of value, directly or indirectly, as an inducement to obtaining title insurance business. In addition, state law prohibits a person in the real estate services industry, or any other person, from receiving, directly or indirectly, any rebate, reduction, or a special favor or advantage, or a monetary consideration or inducement.

01/12/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-007.cfm,Secretary Donovan Announces the First Recovery Act Green Retrofit Grant for Multi-Family Housing,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Shaun Donovan today announced that nearly 200 apartment units in New York City will become more energy efficient as the result of $3.6 million in funding being awarded today to Jonathan Rose Companies, a New York-based property owner and developer. It is the first award to be announced under HUD's new Green Retrofit Program for Multifamily Housing, created through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The Green Retrofit Program is providing $250 million nationally to reduce energy costs, cut water consumption, and improve indoor air quality. Additional grant awards will be made under this program over the next few months on a rolling basis. The project being funded today is West 135th St Apartments in Harlem, New York, a 198-unit, 10 building, Section 8 assisted property. The renovation to this project will enhance quality of life for residents and increase energy efficiency. It will produce an approximately 25% savings in utility costs and will create quality construction-related job opportunities. Retrofits will include EnergyStar refrigerators, replacement of 32 old boilers with 10 high-efficiency boilers, rooftop solar photovoltaic panels, formaldehyde-free kitchen cabinets, recycled-material kitchen counters, EnergyStar ceiling fans, compact fluorescent lamp (CFL) fixtures and bulbs, double-pane argon-filled low emissivity (low-e) windows, insulated exterior doors, low-flow fixtures, shower heads and toilets, linoleum flooring to replace vinyl tile, wood floor installations using Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)-certified wood, and non-toxic paints, adhesives and sealants throughout. ""I am proud to announce this award to Jonathan Rose today because he has been a leading innovator, advocate and practitioner of green building, particularly of green affordable housing,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""This funding will not only improve New York's housing stock, but will lower energy costs and create quality green jobs."" The Green Retrofit Program is designed to create thousands of green jobs across the country as workers retrofit older federally assisted multi-family apartment developments with the next generation of energy efficient technologies. Grants and loans provided through this program help private landlords and property management companies to cut heating and air conditioning costs by installing more efficient heating and cooling systems and to reduce water use by replacing faucets and toilets. These Recovery Act funds also produce other environmental benefits by encouraging the use of recycled building materials, reflective roofing, and non-toxic products to reduce potentially harmful 'out gassing' of harmful fumes. Funds are awarded to owners of HUD-assisted housing projects and can be used for a wide range of retrofit activities, ranging from windows/doors to solar panels and geothermal installation. The Recovery Act includes $13.61 billion for projects and programs administered by HUD, nearly 75 percent of which was allocated to state and local recipients only eight days after President Obama signed the Act into law. The remaining 25 percent of funds is being awarded through competitive grant programs including the Green Retrofit Program. HUD is committed to implementing Recovery Act investments swiftly and effectively as they generate tens of thousands of jobs, modernize homes to make them energy efficient, and help the families and communities hardest hit by the economic crisis. In addition, Secretary Donovan and the Department are committed to providing the highest level of transparency possible as Recovery Act funds are administered. It is vitally important that the American people are fully aware of how their tax dollars are being spent and can hold their federal leaders accountable. Every dollar of Recovery Act funds HUD spends can be reviewed and tracked at HUD's Recovery Act website. The full text of HUD's funding notices and tracking of future performance of these grants is also available at HUD's Recovery Act website."
01/13/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-010.cfm,Administration Completes Implementation of Initiative to Support State and Local Housing Finance Agencies,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of the Treasury, together with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) today announced the completion of all transactions under the recently-introduced state and local Housing Finance Agency (HFA) Initiative, a key element of the Obama Administration's Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan. With these transactions, the Obama Administration helps support low mortgage rates and expands resources for low and middle income borrowers to purchase or rent homes that are affordable over the long term. Government Sponsored Enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac played a central role in both Initiative design and transaction execution. The HFA Initiative is expected to come at no cost to taxpayers. Through more than 90 participating HFAs, the HFA Initiative will make affordable financing available to hundreds of thousands of new homebuyers and existing homeowners, as well as support the development and rehabilitation of multi-family rental properties. Mortgages can be used to purchase or rehabilitate homes, as well as refinance existing mortgages at more affordable rates. Participating HFAs are also expected to provide affordable multifamily loans that will help keep rents affordable for tens of thousands of renters. Participating state and local agencies have already begun providing affordable mortgages financed through the HFA Initiative. ""Supporting the work of state and local HFAs is critical to the Administration's broader initiative to stabilize the housing market, which is helping to keep mortgage rates low and mortgage finance flowing for American households across the country,"" said Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner. ""The assistance provided under the HFA Initiative will help maintain the viability of state and local HFAs which play key roles in HUD's efforts to promote expanded access to affordable rental housing and serve as important players in making homeownership possible for hardworking Americans who otherwise would not be able to purchase or remain in their homes,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""Working together we were able to address the stresses on HFAs created by the housing market turmoil,"" said FHFA Acting Director Edward J. DeMarco. ""The Enterprises played a critical role, consistent with their mission and on commercially reasonable terms. Their successful execution of over 125 separate transactions, all in the final month of 2009, was an impressive achievement."" ""Given our long-standing partnership with state and local HFAs, we were able to move quickly to support the Administration's initiative, which is targeted directly at affordable housing for America's working families,"" said Michael J. Williams, Fannie Mae President and CEO. ""By creating $23 billion in much-needed, new housing capital for the housing finance system, this initiative will enable the HFAs to return to the level of market liquidity they have provided historically."" ""We applaud the successful completion of the HFA Initiative. Freddie Mac is proud to provide an essential financial link to the nation's state and local HFAs that will support affordable homeownership and rental housing and help stimulate America's housing markets,"" said Freddie Mac CEO Ed Haldeman.
Local and State Impact of the Initiative
""These bond proceeds, combined with the $7.7 billion in retail housing bonds the Initiative requires state HFAs to issue, will allow HFAs to finance more than 200,000 affordable homes, while generating jobs and tax revenue for the economy,"" said Susan Dewey, president of the National Council of State Housing Agencies (NCSHA) and executive director of the Virginia Housing Development Authority. ""HFAs are already putting these resources to work to provide first-time home buyer mortgages and finance rental housing,"" Dewey added. ""The National Association of Local Housing Finance Agencies (NALHFA) applauds the Treasury, Federal Housing Finance Agency, and especially the Government-Sponsored Enterprises for putting together, in a nearly impossible timeframe, this vital bond purchase program and liquidity facility. It will give participating local housing finance agencies the ability to significantly expand homeownership and rental housing opportunities for their lower income households,"" said NALHFA President Patricia Braynon, Executive Director of the Miami-Dade County, FL Housing Finance Authority. ""The Treasury Initiative will provide loans to approximately 11,000 home buyers in Pennsylvania, as well as putting our home builders back to work,"" said Executive Director of the Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency Brian Hudson. ""I believe a new and stronger partnership has been formed between the Administration, the GSEs, and state HFAs to deliver affordable housing across the nation."" ""As one of many HFAs that have participated in the Administration's HFA Initiative, the Idaho Housing and Finance Association has been able to once again access the tax-exempt bond markets for affordable homeownership lending capital,"" said President and Executive Director of the Idaho Housing and Finance Association Gerald Hunter. ""Many prospective home buyers will be able to purchase homes because of this financing opportunity. And, it comes at a time when our economy needs all the assistance it can get. We appreciate the professional and focused efforts by the many staff members at Treasury, HUD, FHFA, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac to make this opportunity available for our citizens.""
On October 19, Treasury announced a new initiative for state and local HFAs to help support low mortgage rates and expand resources for low and middle income borrowers to purchase or rent homes that are affordable over the long term. Following up on the intent to support HFAs first outlined in February under the Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan, the Administration's Initiative has two parts: a New Issue Bond Program (NIBP) to support new lending by HFAs and a Temporary Credit and Liquidity Program (TCLP) to improve the access of HFAs to liquidity for outstanding HFA bonds. The New Issue Bond Program (NIBP) The New Issue Bond Program (NIBP) provided temporary financing for HFAs to issue new housing bonds. Treasury purchased securities of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac backed by these new housing bonds. With these investments, the HFAs have issued an amount of new housing bonds equal to what they are authorized to issue with the allocations provided them by Congress but have been unable to issue given the current challenges in housing and related markets. The program may support up to several hundred thousand new mortgages to first time homebuyers this coming year, as well as refinancing opportunities to put at-risk, but responsible and performing, borrowers into more sustainable mortgages. The NIBP will also support development of tens of thousands of new rental housing units for working families. The Temporary Credit and Liquidity Program (TCLP) Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are administering a Temporary Credit and Liquidity Program (TCLP) for HFAs to help relieve current financial strains and enable them to continue to serve their important role in providing housing resources to working families. Treasury has agreed to purchase a participation interest in the Temporary Credit and Liquidity Facilities (TCLFs) provided to HFAs under the program, providing a credit and liquidity backstop. The TCLP provides HFAs with temporary credit and liquidity facilities to help the HFAs maintain their financial health and preserve the viability of the HFA infrastructure so that HFAs can continue their Congressionally supported role in helping provide affordable mortgage credit to low and moderate income Americans, as well as continue their other important activities in communities. Over 90 state and local HFAs representing 49 states participated in the NIBP for an aggregate total new issuance of $15.3 billion. Twelve HFAs participated in the TCLP for an aggregate total usage of $8.2 billion. The Initiative is expected to come at no cost to the taxpayers and to the Government Sponsored Enterprises."
01/14/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-012.cfm,"HUD Secretary Donovan Announces $2 Billion in Recovery Act Grants to Stabilize Neighborhoods, Rebuild Local Economies","WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Shaun Donovan announced today that HUD is awarding $2 billion in Recovery Act funding to states, local governments and non-profit housing developers, under HUD's Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP), to spur economic development in hard-hit communities and create jobs. Nearly 60 grantees are receiving awards. A full list of grants awarded today can be found on HUD's website.
Funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, this round of NSP grants is being awarded competitively to applicants who developed the most innovative ideas to rebuild local communities, while demonstrating that they have the capacity to be responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars.
""By investing Recovery Act dollars in revitalizing hard-hit neighborhoods, we're not only creating new job opportunities, but giving communities across the country an opportunity for a fresh start,"" said Vice President Biden. ""These competitive awards go to the heart of the Recovery Act: funding innovative projects that both provide immediate relief and help lay a new foundation for long-term economic growth.""
""Vacant homes have a debilitating effect on neighborhoods and often lead to reduced property values, blight, and neighborhood decay,"" said Donovan. ""This additional $2 billion in Recovery Act funding will help stabilize hard hit communities by turning vacant homes into affordable housing opportunities. The Neighborhood Stabilization program is a key part of the Obama Administration's comprehensive approach to address the national housing and economic crisis.""
The $2 billion in NSP grants being awarded today will build on the work being done now to help state and local governments and non-profit developers collaborate to acquire land and property; to demolish or rehabilitate abandoned properties; and/or to offer down-payment and closing cost assistance to low- to middle-income homebuyers. Grantees can also create ""land banks"" to assemble, temporarily manage, and dispose of foreclosed homes.
The awards will also require housing counseling for families receiving homebuyer assistance funds through NSP. In addition, it will protect homebuyers by requiring grantees to ensure that new homebuyers under this program obtain a mortgage from a lender who agrees to comply with sound lending practices.
The Neighborhood Stabilization Program was created to redevelop hard-hit communities, create jobs, and grow local economies by providing communities with the resources to purchase and rehabilitate vacant homes and convert them to affordable housing. Last year, HUD awarded nearly $4 billion in NSP formula funds to over 300 grantees nationwide to help state and local governments respond to the housing crisis and falling home values.
In addition, on August 26, 2009, HUD awarded $50 million in technical assistance grants to help grantees more effectively manage the inventory of abandoned homes they purchase under the Neighborhood Stabilization Program. HUD's NSP technical assistance grants are helping NSP recipients to implement sound underwriting, management, and fiscal controls; measure outcomes created by public funds; build the capacity of public-private partnerships; develop strategies to serve low-income households; incorporate energy efficiency into NSP programs; provide support, and training on the operation of 'land banks'; and train NSP recipients on HUD program rules and financial management requirements.
President Obama signed the Recovery Act into law on February 17, 2009 as the country faced the greatest economic crisis since the Great Depression. The $787 billion Recovery Act program has already provided nearly $100 billion in tax relief for families and businesses, helped fill critical budget gaps for hard-hit state and local governments and jump-started tens of thousands of projects that are creating jobs and laying a new foundation for long-term economic growth.

01/15/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-01-15.cfm,"Administration Releases December Loan Modification Report, Update on Conversion Drive","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today released an update on the Administration's aggressive nationwide campaign to help borrowers in the trial phase of their modified mortgages convert to permanent modifications under the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP). The new December data demonstrates that there has been a significant acceleration in the rate at which borrowers are being approved for permanent modifications. As of December, more than 100,000 permanent modifications have been approved, including 66,000 that borrowers have accepted and the remainder awaiting only the borrower's signature. Under HAMP, more than 850,000 homeowners have had a median payment reduction exceeding $500.
""Treasury is committed to working with servicers and borrowers to sustain this improved pace,"" said Chief of Treasury's Homeownership Preservation Office (HPO) Phyllis Caldwell.
HUD Senior Advisor for Mortgage Finance William Apgar echoed this commitment: ""HUD will continue to work with our Administration partners and utilize our broad network of housing counseling agencies to increase the number of borrowers receiving sustainable and affordable modifications under HAMP.""
The Administration has taken a number of steps to assist servicers in ramping up to give eligible homeowners the opportunity to participate in HAMP. Over the past month, Administration representatives were on-site in servicer offices to ensure that servicers increased efforts to deliver decisions to borrowers in trial modifications who had submitted all of their documents and to obtain any missing documents from borrowers. The Administration also implemented a temporary review period to ensure that all borrowers are being fairly evaluated for the program - the temporary review period extends until January 31, 2010.
HAMP was designed to offer up to 3-4 million homeowners reduced monthly mortgage payments that are affordable and sustainable over the long-term, over the life of the program. Currently, several million homeowners are estimated to be eligible for the program and more than 1 million have already received modification offers. At this pace, the program is on track to meet the goals that President Obama laid out in announcing the Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan. This Plan included several housing initiatives beyond mortgage modifications, including broad support for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to keep interest rates low and facilitate mortgage affordability across the market, increased flexibilities for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in refinancing mortgages to provide homeowners with lower monthly payments, tax credits to support development of affordable housing, and support to state and local housing finance agencies. In just the first year, the Administration has launched all of these critical initiatives.
As part of an ongoing commitment to continuously provide greater transparency in all of the Administration's financial stability efforts, the December report includes several new measurements including a breakdown of permanent modification characteristics. These characteristics include predominant hardship reasons and monthly payment savings.

01/15/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-011.cfm,HUD Takes Action to Speed Resale of Foreclosed Properties to New Owners,"WASHINGTON - In an effort to stabilize home values and improve conditions in communities where foreclosure activity is high, HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan today announced a temporary policy that will expand access to FHA mortgage insurance and allow for the quick resale of foreclosed properties. The announcement is part of the Obama administration commitment to addressing foreclosure. Just yesterday, Secretary Donovan announced $2 billion in Neighborhood Stabilization Program grants to local communities and nonprofit housing developers to combat the effects of vacant and abandoned homes.
""As a result of the tightened credit market, FHA-insured mortgage financing is often the only means of financing available to potential homebuyers,"" said Donovan. ""FHA has an unprecedented opportunity to fulfill its mission by helping many homebuyers find affordable housing while contributing to neighborhood stabilization.""
With certain exceptions, FHA currently prohibits insuring a mortgage on a home owned by the seller for less than 90 days. This temporary waiver will give FHA borrowers access to a broader array of recently foreclosed properties.
""This change in policy is temporary and will have very strict conditions and guidelines to assure that predatory practices are not allowed,"" Donovan said.
In today's market, FHA research finds that acquiring, rehabilitating and the reselling these properties to prospective homeowners often takes less than 90 days. Prohibiting the use of FHA mortgage insurance for a subsequent resale within 90 days of acquisition adversely impacts the willingness of sellers to allow contracts from potential FHA buyers because they must consider holding costs and the risk of vandalism associated with allowing a property to sit vacant over a 90-day period of time.
The policy change will permit buyers to use FHA-insured financing to purchase HUD-owned properties, bank-owned properties, or properties resold through private sales. This will allow homes to resell as quickly as possible, helping to stabilize real estate prices and to revitalize neighborhoods and communities.
""FHA borrowers, because of the restrictions we are now lifting, have often been shut out from buying affordable properties,"" said FHA Commissioner David H. Stevens. ""This action will enable our borrowers, especially first-time buyers, to take advantage of this opportunity.""
The waiver will take effect on February 1, 2010 and is effective for one year, unless otherwise extended or withdrawn by the FHA Commissioner. To protect FHA borrowers against predatory practices of ""flipping"" where properties are quickly resold at inflated prices to unsuspecting borrowers, this waiver is limited to those sales meeting the following general conditions:
All transactions must be arms-length, with no identity of interest between the buyer and seller or other parties participating in the sales transaction. In cases in which the sales price of the property is 20 percent or more above the seller's acquisition cost, the waiver will only apply if the lender meets specific conditions. The waiver is limited to forward mortgages, and does not apply to the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) for purchase program.

""To honor Dr. King, we will train the next generation of leaders and activists in fair housing,"" stated HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity John D. Trasviña.
This partnership is designed to promote fair housing and educate students about their rights under the Fair Housing Act which prohibits discrimination in housing based on race, color, national origin, sex, religion, families with children, or disability.
In addition, campuses will develop service-learning opportunities with local fair housing groups and encourage students to consider public service as a career. Trasviña will join TSU President Melvin N. Johnson to sign a proclamation marking the official start of the National Fair Housing Collegiate Partnership Campaign.
""In 1963, Dr. King had a dream. Through this partnership, HUD empowers today's students to act on that dream in 2010,"" said Trasviña. ""HUD is committed to ensuring that every door is open to our next generation of renters and homebuyers. We will accomplish this through education and vigorously enforcing the law.""
""Tennessee State University is honored to have been selected as the host institution to kick off the National Fair Housing Collegiate Partnership. For almost 100 years, TSU has produced globally prepared students who--like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.--dream of fairness and equality. Today, this partnership will continue to ensure that all students are treated fairly and equally under the law, and that all exercise their rights to fair housing,"" Johnson said in making the announcement. ""TSU along with HUD encourages all students to become public servants and citizens of the world, ensuring equality and fairness to all.""
This is the first of a series of educational partnerships by HUD at campuses across the country. HUD will take this message to Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government on February 24, 2010 and plans are underway to visit colleges and universities throughout the year.
HUD investigates over 10,000 housing discrimination complaints annually.

01/20/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-016.cfm,FHA Announces Policy Changes to Address Risk and Strengthen Finances,"WASHINGTON - Federal Housing Administration (FHA) Commissioner David Stevens today announced a set of policy changes to strengthen the FHA's capital reserves, while enabling the agency to continue to fulfill its mission to provide access to homeownership for underserved communities. The changes announced today are the latest in a series of changes Stevens has enacted in order to better position the FHA to manage its risk while continuing to support the nation's housing market recovery.
The FHA will propose to take the following steps: increase the mortgage insurance premium (MIP); update the combination of FICO scores and down payments for new borrowers; reduce seller concessions to three percent, from six percent; and implement a series of significant measures aimed at increasing lender enforcement. U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan previewed the changes in December of last year, noting that the FHA would announce additional details before the end of January.
""Striking the right balance between managing the FHA's risk, continuing to provide access to underserved communities, and supporting the nation's economic recovery is critically important,"" said Commissioner Stevens. ""When combined with the risk management measures announced in September of last year, these changes are among the most significant steps to address risk in the agency's history. Additionally, by continuing to provide affordable, responsible mortgage products, FHA will support the housing market's recovery. Importantly, FHA will remain the largest source of home purchase financing for underserved communities.""
Announced FHA Policy Changes:
• Mortgage insurance premium (MIP) will be increased to build up capital reserves and bring back private lending The first step will be to raise the up-front MIP by 50 bps to 2.25% and request legislative authority to increase the maximum annual MIP that the FHA can charge. If this authority is granted, then the second step will be to shift some of the premium increase from the up-front MIP to the annual MIP. This shift will allow for the capital reserves to increase with less impact to the consumer, because the annual MIP is paid over the life of the loan instead of at the time of closing The initial up-front increase is included in a Mortgagee Letter to be released tomorrow, January 21st, and will go into effect in the spring.

• Update the combination of FICO scores and down payments for new borrowers. New borrowers will now be required to have a minimum FICO score of 580 to qualify for FHA's 3.5% down payment program. New borrowers with less than a 580 FICO score will be required to put down at least 10%. This allows the FHA to better balance its risk and continue to provide access for those borrowers who have historically performed well. This change will be posted in the Federal Register in February and, after a notice and comment period, would go into effect in the early summer.

Specific authority includes: Amendment of section 256 of the National Housing Act to apply indemnification provisions to all Direct Endorsement lenders. This would require all approved mortgagees to assume liability for all of the loans that they originate and underwrite. Legislative authority permitting HUD maximum flexibility to establish separate ""areas"" for purposes of review and termination under the Credit Watch initiative. This would provide authority to withdraw originating and underwriting approval for a lender nationwide on the basis of the performance of its regional branches.

01/22/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-017.cfm,FHA to Provide Early Relief to Struggling Homeowners,"WASHINGTON - Homeowners with FHA-insured mortgage loans who are experiencing financial hardship are now eligible for loss mitigation assistance before they fall behind on their mortgage payments. Previously, these homeowners were not eligible for such assistance until after they had missed payments.
The Helping Families Save Their Home Act of 2009 signed into law by President Obama expanded FHA's authority to use its loss mitigation tools to assist FHA borrowers avoid foreclosure to include those facing ""imminent default"" as defined by the Secretary. FHA today issued guidance to FHA-approved loan servicers on how to assist these FHA borrowers.
""Loss mitigation assistance is beneficial to both borrowers and FHA because it helps borrowers retain their homes while protecting the FHA insurance fund from unnecessary losses,"" said FHA Commissioner David Stevens. ""FHA has always required lenders to establish early contact with delinquent borrowers to discuss the reason for missing a payment and to evaluate reinstatement options. Now servicers will have additional options for those borrowers who seek help before they go delinquent, which increases the likelihood that the borrower will be able to retain their home.""
Effective immediately, the loss mitigation options of forbearance and FHA's Home Affordable Modification Program (FHA-HAMP) may be used to assist borrowers facing imminent default.
FHA defines an ""FHA borrower facing imminent default"" to be an FHA borrower who is current or less than 30 days past due on the mortgage obligation and is experiencing a significant reduction in income or some other hardship that will prevent him or her from making the next required payment on the mortgage during the month that it is due. A forbearance agreement is an agreement by the loan servicer to postpone, reduce or suspend payments due on a loan for a limited and specific time period. FHA-HAMP allows qualified FHA-insured borrowers to reduce their monthly mortgage payment to an affordable level by permanently reducing the payment through the use of a partial claim combined with a loan modification. The partial claim defers the repayment of a portion of the mortgage principal through an interest-free subordinate mortgage that is not due until the first mortgage is paid off. The remaining balance is then modified through re-amortization and in some cases, an interest rate reduction.

A scheduled temporary shutdown of the employer, (such as for a scheduled vacation), would not in and by itself be adequate to support an imminent default.
• A change in household financial circumstances, e.g., death in family, serious or chronic illness, permanent or short-term disability.
Loan servicers must document the basis for its determination that a payment default is imminent and retain all documentation used to reach its conclusion. The servicer's documentation must also include information on the borrower's financial condition.

Today's action prevents TopDot from participating in FHA programs and seeks a monetary penalty of $674,000. In addition, the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae) is defaulting and terminating TopDot as an issuer in its Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS) program and is ending the Company's ability to continue to service Ginnie Mae securities. Servicing of TopDot's $181.2 million dollar Ginnie Mae portfolio will be transferred to LoanCare Servicing Center, Inc. The MRB and Ginnie Mae took these actions based upon TopDot's numerous and egregious violations of FHA requirements, including failure to document borrowers' income, evaluate borrowers' creditworthiness, and approving loans with grossly excessive debt-to-income ratios without compensating factors to justify approval. ""This lender demonstrated a pattern of utter disregard for how we do business and its behavior not only put the FHA insurance fund at risk, but placed their own customers at greater risk of foreclosure,"" said FHA Commissioner David Stevens. ""FHA approval is a privilege that we entrust to the most responsible lenders. If any lender violates that trust, the MRB will take action to protect borrowers, the FHA insurance fund and FHA programs."" Mary Kinney, Ginnie Mae's Executive Vice President, said ""Ginnie Mae's requirements are in place to protect the borrower and the American taxpayer. Both, Ginnie Mae and FHA are working aggressively to ensure that borrowers are not harmed by the misdeeds of lenders. These lenders are on notice that they must strictly adhere to Ginnie Mae and FHA regulations to maintain their status within HUD programs."" While TopDot may appeal FHA's withdrawal by submitting a written request for a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge within 30 days, the filing of an appeal does not delay the actions announced today. A complaint seeking civil money penalties will be served on TopDot in due course and the Company will have the opportunity to contest the imposition of the penalties before an Administrative Law Judge. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is also continuing to evaluate the conduct of individuals who participated in TopDot's violations of FHA requirements and will move quickly to take appropriate action against those individuals. If TopDot is your mortgage company, see HUD's website for more information about the status of your loan and the next steps for borrowers. FHA and Ginnie Mae have taken several steps to minimize the disruption to borrowers whose loans are serviced by TopDot and are committed to protecting all FHA-insured borrowers and the American taxpayer."
01/25/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-019.cfm,"FHA Withdraws Three Lenders, Suspends a Fourth","WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration's Mortgagee Review Board (MRB) today announced that it is immediately and permanently withdrawing the FHA approval of three mortgage lenders and is suspending a fourth. The MRB withdrew the FHA approval of Strategic Mortgage Corporation (Strategic), ProMortgage Inc., and Americare Investment Group Inc. (doing business as Premier Capital Lending). Additionally, the MRB has suspended the FHA approval of Home Mortgage, Inc. (HMI) of Burr Ridge, Illinois.
""FHA takes its oversight role very seriously and will move swiftly and decisively to protect borrowers from unscrupulous lenders,"" said FHA Commissioner David Stevens. ""Any lender who refuses to comply with FHA requirements will simply no longer enjoy the privilege of participating in FHA programs.""
Today's withdrawal actions will permanently prevent Strategic, ProMortgage and Americare from participating in FHA programs while the suspension of HMI will apply for a minimum of six months or until a federal court rules in a related matter (see below). The MRB took these actions based upon the following serious violations of FHA requirements:
Strategic (based in Oklahoma City, OK) failed to comply with employment requirements, charged borrowers impermissible or excessive fees, failed to disclose all fees on the Good Faith Estimates, and submitted a false certification to HUD in connection with an application for FHA insurance. The MRB also voted to seek civil a monetary penalty from Strategic in the amount of $71,000. ProMortgage (based in Claremore, OK) failed to adopt and maintain a Quality Control Plan, failed to perform Quality Control reviews of loans that went into default within six months after closing, engaged in a prohibited branch arrangement, made false certifications on the HUD/VA Addendum to the Uniform Residential Loan Application (URLA), failed to comply with home office operation requirements, and failed to report employee compensation on the appropriate form. In addition, the Company allowed borrowers to provide verification of employment directly to the lender which creates an opportunity for manipulation or falsification of documents submitted. Verification of employment must be submitted directly to the lender by the employer. The MRB also voted to seek a monetary penalty from ProMortgage in the amount of $124,000. Americare (based in Arlington, TX) breached the terms of a settlement with HUD by failing to make any of the required monthly payments. On October 8, 2009, the Board entered into a settlement with Americare requiring the Company to pay of a monetary penalty of $124,000 and placing it on probation for a period of six months. Since then, Americare failed to make a single monthly payment as required under the terms of the earlier agreement. HMI (based in Burr Ridge, IL) retained its part owner and Chief Executive Officer despite his indictment and subsequent guilty plea for bank fraud. In June 2009, HMI's part owner and CEO was indicted in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division for his role in a scheme to obtain money for 450 fictitious residential mortgage loans; a guilty plea was entered in this matter on January 15, 2010. HMI failed to notify HUD of this indictment as required. Additionally, HMI failed to comply with FHA's annual recertification requirements.

In addition to these sanctions, the Mortgagee Review Board also took action against the following lenders:

The Mortgagee Review Board also voted to impose a monetary penalty in the amount of $7,000. Cooper and Shein, LLC (doing business as Great Oak Lending Partners) of Timonium, Maryland was placed on probation for a period of six months due to its misleading advertising practices.

01/28/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-020.cfm,HUD and CPSC Issue Guidance on Identifying Problem Drywall in Homes,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) today issued guidance on how to identify the presence of metal corrosion, as well as other indicators of problem drywall in homes. The guidance takes into account visual signs of metal corrosion, evidence of drywall installation in the relevant time period, and the identification of other corroborating evidence or characteristics.
HUD and CPSC's two-step guidance requires a visual inspection that must show blackening of copper electrical wiring and/or air conditioning evaporator coils; and the installation of new drywall (for new construction or renovations) between 2001 and 2008. To view the full text of this guidance, visit HUD's website or CPSC's website (www.cpsc.gov/info/drywall/InterimIDGuidance012810.pdf).
The guidance also describes obtaining additional corroborating evidence of problem drywall, since it is possible that corrosion of metal in homes can occur for other reasons. For example, homes with new drywall installed between 2005 and 2008 (and the significant increase in imported problem drywall due in part to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita) must meet at least two additional criteria related to: the chemical analysis of metal corrosion in the home; elemental markers in the drywall; markings on the drywall; or specific chemical emissions from the drywall. Homes with new drywall installed between 2001 and 2004 must meet a total of at least four of those criteria. Collecting evidence of these corroborating conditions may require professional assistance and analysis.
""Families have the right to know if their homes contain problem drywall so they can begin the process of doing needed repairs,"" said Jon Gant, Director of HUD's Office of Healthy Homes and Lead Hazard Control. ""This guidance offers homeowners, contractors and state and local authorities a course of action for knowing if they're dealing with problem drywall or not.""
""We are moving forward to help families who are suffering from problem drywall in their homes. We are committed to helping them, and we will continue to rely on solid science to identify the specific causes and remedies for problem drywall,"" said CPSC Chairman Inez Tenenbaum.
This preliminary identification guidance developed by the Federal Interagency Task Force on Problem Drywall is based primarily on the presence of metal corrosion in homes as well as other indicators of problem drywall. Additional analysis will continue to validate these methods and the identification guidance may be modified as necessary.
FHA-insured families experiencing problems associated with problem drywall may be eligible for assistance to help them rehabilitate their properties. HUD's Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program may also be a resource to help local communities combat the problem.
Homeowners who believe they may have problem drywall should immediately report to CPSC by calling 800-638-2772 or logging on to www.cpsc.gov/cgibin/drywall.aspx. Hearing- or speech-challenged individuals may access the phone number through TTY by calling the toll-free Federal Relay Service at 800-877-8339."
01/28/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-021.cfm,Administration Updates Documentation Collection Process and Releases Guidance to Expedite Permanent Modifications,"WASHINGTON - As part of the Administration's ongoing housing market stabilization plan, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today released updated guidance for servicers participating in the Administration's mortgage modification program. This guidance refines the documentation requirements in order to expedite conversions of current trial modifications to permanent ones.
""With more than 850,000 homeowners in trial and permanent modifications, we are providing immediate relief to struggling homeowners,"" said Phyllis Caldwell, Chief of Treasury's Homeownership Preservation Office. ""Today's guidance represents our commitment to more efficiently move qualified homeowners into permanent modifications.""
""Increasing the number of borrowers receiving permanent modifications under HAMP is critical to our efforts to preserve affordable and sustainable homeownership,"" said HUD Senior Advisor for Housing Finance William Apgar. ""While we continue to meet our goals to provide immediate assistance, the updates announced today should enable servicers to transition borrowers more quickly and easily from trial to permanent modification.""
On December 23, 2009, the Administration required most trial modifications to be placed in a temporary review period to ensure that all borrowers are being fairly evaluated for the program. During this temporary review period, servicers were not permitted to cancel an active HAMP trial modification for any reason other than failure to meet the HAMP property eligibility requirements. This allowed servicers to convert a significant number of trial modifications to permanent ones. In fact, the total number of conversions more than doubled in December. Guidance released today will help improve this conversion process for the future.
The updated process requires that key documents, including proof of income, be obtained from the borrower before a borrower evaluation can begin. This more robust requirement of upfront documentation will make it easier and quicker to convert trial modifications to permanent modifications and enable servicers to use their resources more effectively.
Guidance Details
Supplemental Directive 10-01 provides guidance on two major issues:
• New Requirements that Documentation be Provided Before Trial Modification Begins Today's guidance refines the documentation process and makes it easier for eligible borrowers in trial modifications to get permanent modifications quickly. Under this guidance: A simple, standard package of documents will be required prior to the servicer's evaluation of the borrower for a trial modification. This process will be required for all new HAMP modifications that became effective after June 1, although mortgage servicers may implement it sooner.
• Converting Borrowers in the Temporary Review Period to Permanent Modifications In December, Treasury implemented a review period through January 31 to provide servicers additional time to collect and submit missing documentation for borrowers in trial modifications, to require that borrowers be notified of any missing documents, and to give borrowers an opportunity to dispute and correct any erroneous information in their applications. Today's guidance clarifies for servicers the proper procedures for conversion of those borrowers who are current on their monthly payments to permanent modifications.
Background
The Home Affordable Modification Program aims to help responsible American homeowners maintain a sustainable monthly mortgage payment through a pay-for-success framework that aligns incentives of borrowers, lenders and servicers. Over 900,000 Americans have begun trial modifications since the program's inception and over 110,000 have been approved for permanent modifications as of December 31, 2009. The median monthly savings for individual homeowners is more than $500 per month. Over 100 servicers have signed up to participate in HAMP, covering more than 89% of mortgage debt outstanding in the country.

01/29/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-022.cfm,HUD Selects Three Innovating Housing Authorities to Elite Program to Enhance Federal Rental Assistance Programs,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development Assistant Secretary Sandra B. Henriquez today announced the three public housing agencies that will participate in HUD's Moving To Work Program (MTW). MTW allows housing agencies to design and test innovative housing strategies that assist lower income families living in public housing or who are assisted through HUD's Housing Choice Voucher Program.
Public housing authorities in Champaign County, Illinois; Orlando, Florida; and Tacoma, Washington will join 30 other agencies across the U.S. These three housing authorities were selected from among eight agencies that applied for MTW designation late last year and will reap the benefits this designation until 2018 (see attached summaries).
""The agencies we selected today clearly demonstrated their ability to create innovative approaches to housing and to form private partnerships that can really build on public dollars,"" said Henriquez, who leads HUD's Office of Public and Indian Housing. ""HUD supports our housing partners to think outside of the box to improve our federal programs to better assist low-income families.""
The MTW program was created in 1996 as a demonstration or ""test project"" to give housing authorities the opportunity to design and test innovative, locally developed housing and self-sufficiency strategies for low income families participating in HUD's public housing and Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) programs. HUD exempts these agencies from certain rules and permits them to combine their multiple sources of HUD funding into a single agency-wide funding source. MTW agencies also get considerable flexibility in determining how to use their HUD funding. These agencies are, however, required to serve substantially the same number and type of households as they would without MTW designation. The program aims to accomplish three goals:
Reduce costs and achieve greater cost effectiveness in federal expenditures; Give incentives to families with children where the head of household is working, is seeking work, or is preparing for work by participating in job training, educational programs, or programs that assist people to obtain employment and become economically self-sufficient; and Increase housing choices for low-income families.

02/01/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-026.cfm,"HUD FY2011 Budget Focuses on Fiscal Discipline, Investing in People and Places","WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Shaun Donovan today unveiled the Department's fiscal year 2011 budget proposal, following President Barack Obama's presentation of his Administration-wide budget. The HUD budget focuses on fiscal discipline, creating jobs and builds on the administration's first year accomplishments by proposing reform in HUD's housing and community development programs to make them more streamlined, efficient, and accountable.
HUD's budget proposal seeks to make targeted investments in people and places - instead of policies and programs - to effectively support HUD's mission while being accountable to the American taxpayer. $6.9 billion in projected FHA and Ginnie Mae receipts contribute to the FY 2011 proposed $48.5 billion budget total and to the administration's deficit reduction plans. Net of the $6.9 billion in projected FHA and Ginnie Mae receipts the Budget proposes overall funding of $41.6 billion, 5% below fiscal year 2010, and makes difficult decisions to cut funding for a number of programs.
""After a year of progress, we no longer confront an economy or a Department in crisis,"" said Secretary Donovan. ""But much work remains, in much changed fiscal circumstances. Now that the economic crisis has begun to recede, President Obama has committed to reducing the federal deficit. HUD's fiscal year 2011 budget reflects that fiscal discipline. With the Recovery Act and fiscal year 2010 funding having stabilized HUD's programs after years of slow starvation, the time has come to begin transforming them—to make HUD's housing and community development programs more streamlined, efficient, and accountable.""
The carefully targeted investments in the Budget will enable HUD programs to:
House over 2.3 million families in public and assisted housing (over 58% elderly or disabled); Provide voucher assistance to 78,000 additional families (over 47% elderly or disabled); Assist nearly 5.5 million households, over 200,000 more than at the end of fiscal year 2009. More than double the annual rate at which HUD assistance creates new permanent supportive housing for the homeless; Create and retain over 112,000 jobs through the Department's housing and economic development investments in communities across the country.
• House over 2.3 million families in public and assisted housing (over 58% elderly or disabled);
• Provide voucher assistance to 78,000 additional families (over 47% elderly or disabled);
• Assist nearly 5.5 million households, over 200,000 more than at the end of fiscal year 2009.
• More than double the annual rate at which HUD assistance creates new permanent supportive housing for the homeless;
• Create and retain over 112,000 jobs through the Department's housing and economic development investments in communities across the country.
HUD's FY2011 Budget will help strengthen the Nation's housing market to bolster the economy and protect consumers. The budget will reflect $6 billion in profit for the FHA, generated thanks to the FHA reforms announced last month by FHA Commissioner Stevens. Those policy changes will strengthen the FHA's capital reserves, while enabling the agency to continue to fulfill its mission to provide access to homeownership for underserved communities and support the nation's housing market recovery. Thanks to the FHA and Ginnie Mae receipts the total HUD budget will be $48.5 billion, compared to $46.9 billion in FY2010.
The Budget also proposes long term fundamental reforms including launching a new initiative called Transforming Rental Assistance (TRA) to bring HUD's twentieth century rental assistance programs into the twenty first century. TRA will preserve public housing by enabling its owners to address the current and future capital needs of their properties, especially by leveraging private capital, provide more choice to residents and begin to streamline the thirteen separate rental assistance programs run by HUD. The FY2011 budget will provide $350 million to preserve approximately 300,000 units of public and assisted housing, increase administrative efficiency at all levels of program operations, and enhance housing choice for residents. The funding will have three purposes: converting rental assistance to a new funding stream; off-setting costs of combining voucher programs; and tenant mobility. The budget also makes hard choices to ensure reform. For example, HUD proposes to suspend funding for Section 202 Capital Advance Grants in FY 2011 to evaluate and re-design the program in a thoughtful, purposeful way with input from a variety of stakeholders; The Department is proposing $90 million in FY 2011 for Project Rental Assistance Contract (PRAC) Renewals/Amendments and no additional funding for expansion activities in FY 2011.
The Budget reflects a strong administration commitment to preventing and ending homelessness. To support implementation of the Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing (HEARTH) Act signed into law last year by President Obama, the Budget proposes a nearly $200 million increase in homeless assistance funding compared to fiscal year 2010 to increase investment in evidence-based practices, support the shift of local homeless assistance systems to a performance-based orientation, and to better meet the unique needs of rural communities. These investments in prevention will create long term savings in the costs of caring for the homeless. HUD has requested $2.055 billion for Homeless Assistance Grants in its FY2011 budget. $107 million of the new funding would focus on providing up to 10,000 new units of permanent housing for homeless families and individuals and implementing a new rural homelessness program.
As part of the commitment to reforming HUD's community development programs, and helping to create jobs, the FY2011 Budget proposes funding for the new Catalytic Investment Competition Grants program to provide $150 million in competitive grants under the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program. These grants will create jobs and spur game changing economic development opportunities. The budget fulfills President Obama's campaign pledge to fully fund CDBG. CDBG is the Federal Government's largest community development grant program and will be funded at $4.83 billion.
The Budget includes $150 million for a second year of the Sustainable Communities Initiative, which will expand upon HUD's partnership with the Department of Transportation and the Environmental Protection Agency to stimulate more integrated regional planning to guide state, metropolitan, and local decisions to link land use, transportation and housing policy. The budget proposes to expand Choice Neighborhoods from its $65 million funding level in 2010, for a demonstration of this important initiative, to $250 million in 2011. This will enable HUD and our local partners to transform distressed neighborhoods and public and assisted housing into functioning, sustainable mixed-income neighborhoods by linking housing improvements with appropriate services, schools, transportation, and access to jobs. The Budget also provides $60 million for a revamped Capacity Building program, which seeks to expand HUD's funding capabilities and encourage open competition through mainstream and consistent program funding for these activities. Increasing capacity at the local government level is critical as jurisdictions partner with the Administration in implementing key initiatives such as Choice Neighborhoods, Sustainable Communities, and the Catalytic Investment Competition Grants and work to restore the economic vitality of their communities.
The budget also makes investments to ensure that HUD can successfully implement the ambitious changes being proposed. As in the FY2010 budget HUD is again requesting that up to one percent of program funding be transferred to the Transformation Initiative Fund. But this year, HUD is also requesting the creation of a Salaries and Expenses Central Fund to enable the department to provide targeted, temporary infusions of resources to any of HUD's program offices. This Fund will improve HUD's ability to respond to unanticipated crises and new challenges – and help the department hire staff with appropriate expertise.
""This budget promotes innovative and comprehensive approaches to the nation's ongoing affordable housing crisis by making targeted investments to help grow the economy, create jobs and keep people in their homes,"" said Donovan. ""I look forward to the consideration and approval of this budget in Congress.""

02/04/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-028.cfm,HUD Secretary Donovan Announces New Office of Sustainable Housing and Communities,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - During a sustainability forum at Portland State University and a speech to the New Partners for Smart Growth Conference in Seattle, U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan today announced the launch of HUD's new Office of Sustainable Housing and Communities (OSHC). The office will be overseen by HUD Deputy Secretary Ron Sims who won national recognition for turning King County, Washington into a model for sustainable communities. OSHC is designed to help build stronger, more sustainable communities by connecting housing to jobs, fostering local innovation and building a clean energy economy. Funded by Congress for the first time in HUD's 2010 Budget, OSHC is a key component of the Obama Administration's Partnership for Sustainable Communities.
""Through our new Office of Sustainable Housing and Communities, we will begin to tie the quality and location of housing to broader opportunities such as access to good jobs, quality schools, and safe streets,"" said Donovan. ""By working with DOT, EPA and other federal agencies, and with Deputy Secretary Sims' guidance, we will finally begin to meet the needs of today without compromising the futures of our children and grandchildren.""
Under the management of Director Shelley Poticha, OSHC will be the center-point for all of HUD's sustainability efforts. The average household spends more than half of its budget on housing and transportation, which have become American families' two single biggest expenses. With OSHC as lead, HUD will work to improve access to affordable housing and transportation options, saving money for American families while allowing them more time to spend at home and less time traveling.
The office will also invest in energy-efficient homes and buildings, in renewable energy, and in next-generation infrastructure to lay the foundation for the clean energy economy America needs to compete and create jobs in the 21st century. To meet that goal, OSHC will strengthen HUD's Energy Efficient Mortgage product and other energy retrofit financing options—for both single family homes and multi-family rental housing—through a $50 million Energy Innovation Fund. HUD will also make available an Affordability Index that measures the costs of where a home is located in relation to jobs, schools and transportation.
Congress provided $150 million to HUD for a Sustainable Communities Initiative. Of that amount, $100 million is available for regional integrated planning initiatives through HUD's Sustainable Communities Planning Grant Program. To demonstrate HUD's commitment to listening and learning, Secretary Donovan also announced today that a description of the future grant program is available for comment, including through an interactive wiki, on HUD's web site.
With OSHC's grant programs, HUD will provide funding to a wide variety of multi-jurisdictional and multi-sector partnerships and consortia, from Metropolitan Planning Organizations and State governments, to non-profit and philanthropic organizations. These grants will be designed to encourage regions to build their capacity to integrate economic development, land use, transportation, and water infrastructure investments, and to integrate workforce development with transit-oriented development. Accordingly, OSHC's grants will be coordinated closely with the Department of Transportation (DOT) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
Last June, the DOT, EPA and HUD created the unprecedented interagency Partnership for Sustainable Communities. Rooted in six Livability Principles, the three agencies are working together more closely than ever before to meet President Obama's challenge to coordinate federal policies, programs, and resources to help urban, suburban, and rural areas build more sustainable communities. Traditionally there has been no coordination among federal housing, transportation and land use investments. For the first time the federal government will speak with one voice when it comes to housing, transportation and environmental policy, and in doing so will be partner to regions and local governments instead of a barrier.
In addition, Secretary Donovan and HUD are committed to providing the highest level of transparency as we work to streamline federal investments. That is why, in addition to launching the office today, HUD is also launching a new website, www.hud.gov/sustainability, so that the American people can track how their tax dollars are being spent and can hold their federal leaders accountable, and so that communities can have access to valuable resources needed to grow and develop."

02/17/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-041.cfm,Administration Releases January Loan Modification Report,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today released January data for the Administration's Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP), demonstrating that the number of homeowners receiving immediate relief and converting to permanent modifications continues to rise. More than 116,000 homeowners now have permanent modifications, nearly doubling the number from December, which also marked record progress. An additional 76,000 permanent modifications have been offered, and are waiting only for the borrower's signature. In total, Over 1 million homeowners have started trial modifications and nearly 1.3 million offers for trial modifications have been extended to homeowners.
""With nearly one million homeowners paying less each month and the number of permanent modifications steadily rising, HAMP is doing the job it was designed to do,"" said Phyllis Caldwell, Chief of Treasury's Homeownership Preservation Office. ""Struggling families are receiving payment relief and the housing market is showing signs of stabilization.""
Mortgage modifications are one piece of the Administration's broader housing market stabilization plan. Other efforts include support for lower mortgage rates and access to credit, state and local housing agency initiatives, tax credits for homebuyers, neighborhood stabilization and community development programs, and support for mortgage refinancing. After just one year since President Obama announced the Homeownership Affordability and Stability Plan, more than 4 million homeowners have refinanced their mortgages to more affordable levels, interest rates are at record lows, home prices and home sales are rising again and the economy is growing.
According to HUD Senior Advisor for Mortgage Finance William Apgar: ""As the number of permanent modifications grows, HUD will continue to work with our Administration partners and utilize our broad network of housing counseling agencies to increase those numbers still further.""
HAMP is the most ambitious government program of its kind - reaching far more homeowners than any previous program has ever attempted. Less than a year after its launch, the program is providing significant relief to struggling families. More than 940,000 homeowners currently have reduced monthly mortgage payments with a median savings of more than $500. That is an aggregate savings of more than $2.2 billion.
With nearly 1.3 million trial modifications offered already, the program is on pace to meet its overall program goal of providing 3-4 million homeowners the opportunity to stay in their homes.

02/18/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-034.cfm,HUD Report Shows Serious Shortcomings in Hano Operations,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) issued today the results of its 90-day assessment of the Housing Authority of New Orleans (HANO), which found that the agency has suffered from severe management, operational and staffing problems. The operational assessment was prepared by Gilmore Kean, LLC, the consultant HUD named in October 2009 to stabilize and assess HANO.
""The report's findings are serious, but are not unexpected,"" said HUD Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing Sandra B. Henriquez. ""That's why HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan and I took this important first step toward HANO's recovery by calling for the operational assessment to identify exactly what needs to be done to strengthen the agency and regain the public's trust.""
The report highlights numerous shortcomings and systemic problems across most of HANO's departments and programs. Specific findings show that HANO:
Is both under and inappropriately staffed across most departments, and is overly reliant on contractors to perform daily activities. In addition, current staff is not provided sufficient training. Is operating its public housing and Housing Choice Voucher programs without accurate data on the programs' financial condition. Has weak or no internal audit and compliance functions leading to fraud, waste and abuse. Has a highly inefficient procurement process. Does not have a strategic housing management and maintenance plan to adequately organize work to repair, renovate and reoccupy units. Is plagued by inadequate senior oversight of strategic decision-making, staffing and contractors for the ""Big Four"" redevelopment projects.

• Is plagued by inadequate senior oversight of strategic decision-making, staffing and contractors for the ""Big Four"" redevelopment projects.
""Henriquez said that while Gilmore Kean, LLC will continue managing the day-to-day operations at HANO through July 2010, HUD has already begun its search for a long term consultant to implement a new recovery plan based on the findings in this report. HUD estimates it will be three to four years before HANO is returned to local control.
In the coming weeks, Gilmore Kean, LLC will hire a chief financial officer who will closely monitor HANO's day-to-day cash management. In addition, work has begun to restructure the staffing patterns and personnel policies at HANO, to ensure new leadership of its Housing Choice Voucher Program (HCVP). HANO will also issue the results of the HCVP lottery and begin issuing vouchers to the highest priority applicants soon.
""David Gilmore, the administrative receiver, has assured HUD that HANO is operationally solvent and families and clients of the agency will continue to receive services and payments for services rendered,"" said Henriquez. ""We believe that HANO is fixable with hard work and the right leadership. The assessment acknowledges that many HANO employees are eager to see changes made, and with sufficient training they can work to meet HANO's mission to provide high quality, affordable housing for New Orleans families. This assessment is the first step that will lead this housing authority toward achieving that mission.""
In addition to conducting this assessment, the Gilmore Kean, LLC team has also managed HANO's day-to-day operations and has taken quick action to resolve several critically important staffing and redevelopment challenges. Gilmore Kean, LLC has made a substantial effort to ensure HANO fully obligates the $34.5 million in funding received through President Obama's American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009. The deadline for full obligation is March 17, 2010 and as of February 18, HANO has obligated more than 70 percent of those funds, most of which will be used to rebuild vital public housing units in New Orleans. In addition, Gilmore Kean, LLC has maintained a zero-tolerance policy for unethical and illegal behavior by HANO employees and has taken immediate action when a problem has been discovered. Gilmore Kean, LLC and HUD are also working very closely with Providence/Enterprise, the Lafitte developer, to accelerate the number of affordable public housing units built in the first phase of development."

02/24/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-037.cfm,Donovan Announces $26.5 Million in Sweat Equity Grants,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today awarded $26.5 million in ""sweat equity"" grants to produce at least 1,500 affordable homes for low-income individuals and families. Funded through HUD's Self-Help Homeownership Opportunity Program (SHOP), the funding awarded today, along with the labor contributed by these households, will significantly lower the cost of homeownership.
""These families will become homeowners not only because of our grants, but because they've devoted their own sweat and labor to their American Dream,"" said Mercedes M. Márquez, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development. ""Our job is to support sustainable homeownership and these self-help programs do exactly that."" The following organizations will receive SHOP funds:
SHOP grants will be provided to national and regional nonprofit organizations and consortia that have experience in administering self-help housing programs. The funds must be used to purchase land and install or improve infrastructure, which together may not exceed an average investment of $15,000 per dwelling. Grantees may carry out activities directly and/or propose to distribute SHOP funds to local nonprofit affiliates that will acquire and prepare the land for construction, select homebuyers, coordinate the homebuyer sweat equity and volunteer efforts, and assist in the arrangement of interim and permanent financing for the homebuyers.
Homebuyers must contribute a minimum of 100 hours of sweat equity on the construction of their homes and/or the homes of other homebuyers participating in the local self-help housing program. Self-help housing or sweat equity involves the homebuyer's participation in the construction of the housing, which can include, but is not limited to, assisting in the painting, carpentry, trim work, drywall, roofing and siding for the housing. All newly constructed units must receive certification as an ENERGY STAR Qualified New Home and all appliances and products or features which are replaced in rehabilitated units must be ENERGY STAR qualified.
Labor contributed by volunteers also helps buyers who are unable to perform their sweat equity tasks due to disabilities. The sweat equity and labor contributions by the homebuyers and volunteers significantly reduce the cost of the housing."
02/24/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-038.cfm,HUD Charges Puerto Rico Condo Developer with Discriminating Against Homeowner with Disabilities,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today announced that it is charging a San Juan, PR, housing developer with violating the Fair Housing Act by allegedly denying a homeowner with disabilities an accessible parking space close to her home, even though the woman can only walk very short distances. HUD's charge further alleges that the developer, HAL Development Corporation (HAL), offered her the use of a handicapped parking space on a first-come, first-served basis; an option that was unacceptable, given the homeowner's mobility limitations.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to refuse to make reasonable accommodations when they are needed to enable persons with disabilities to fully use and enjoy their home.
""Housing providers have a legal obligation to provide people with disabilities reasonable accommodations. HUD will vigorously enforce that law,"" stated John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity.
The case came to HUD's attention after the homeowner, who lives in Carolina, PR, filed a complaint alleging that HAL had denied her request for an accessible parking space. The woman originally requested a parking space about 100 feet from her apartment that is near an accessible route with railings she can use for support. The parking space she is currently assigned is an additional 135 feet away from the space she requested, severely limiting her ability to come and go.
The HUD charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to the complainant for her damages as a result of the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief to deter further discrimination, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties in order to vindicate the public interest. A federal district court judge may also award punitive damages to the complainant.
FHEO and its partners in the Fair Housing Assistance Program investigate more than 10,000 housing discrimination complaints annually.

The unprecedented aid announced today is funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and is part of the Obama Administration's plan to help communities hardest hit by the downturn in the housing market.
""The foreclosure crisis is especially brutal in places like the City of Las Vegas and Clark County, requiring that we redouble our efforts to stabilize neighborhoods there,"" said Donovan. ""This first-of-its-kind technical assistance will help jump start stabilization programs in Las Vegas and Clark County and makes good on President Obama's pledge to leave no stone unturned in helping those parts of our country experiencing the greatest recovery challenges.""
""I thank Secretary Donovan for responding to my call to provide more help for Nevada homeowners,"" Reid said. ""This funding will go a long way toward helping the City of Las Vegas and Clark County speed up the process of putting Neighborhood Stabilization Program funds to work for southern Nevadans.""
In addition to the funds announced today, HUD has also dispatched teams of technical experts, as well as additional staff, to address the foreclosure crisis and help retool neighborhood stabilization programs in the City of Las Vegas and Clark County, areas that have struggled with difficult market conditions as well as a shortage of trained staff of their own.
HUD's Deputy Assitant Secretary for Community Planning and Development, Yolanda Chavez, will be available to speak on background to the media TODAY, Thursday, February 25, 2010, at 11 a.m. PST, about today's announcement. The conference call dial-in information is below:
Telephone-number: 877-313-1274 Conference ID: 59333850
Background
Nearly one year ago, HUD allocated $72 million (including approximately $15 million to Las Vegas and $30 million to Clark Co.) in grants through the Department's Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP). These grants are designed to help communities throughout Nevada to acquire and redevelop foreclosed properties that might otherwise become sources of abandonment and blight. Last month, HUD awarded an additional $21 million through a second round of NSP funding to address foreclosure/abandonment in Reno, Sparks and Washoe County, Nevada.
The funding announced today will help Las Vegas and Clark County to use and spend the NSP funding they already have more effectively. HUD is dispatching teams of experts, as well as additional HUD staff, to help improve the effectiveness of Las Vegas' and Clark County's neighborhood stabilization programs which are struggling due to a lack of technical expertise. These experienced HUD technical assistance teams will remain in Las Vegas and Clark County through at least September 30, 2012.
HUD's teams will assist both of these communities to modify or, in some cases completely retool the systems necessary to manage programs centered around property acquisition, management, rehabilitation, and resale. In particular, HUD will help Las Vegas to increase productivity in its Housing Assistance Program (HAP); assist in developing construction expertise; and enhance the City's property management capacity. HUD will assist Clark County to develop a more intensive and sophisticated marketing effort to attract buyers of previously foreclosed properties; acquire services or train key personnel in the rapid, high volume acquisition of scattered site single family homes; develop systems and skills to manage a high-volume rehab program; and create comprehensive asset and property management systems specific to scattered site single family properties."
02/26/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-039.cfm,HUD Advances Fight Against Loan Modification Scams,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, in partnership with the Loan Modification Scam Prevention Network, today announced the launch of PreventLoanScams.org (www.preventloanscams.org/).
""Homeowners at risk of foreclosure can be easy prey for home loan modification scammers. Often, dishonest individuals lure vulnerable homeowners into foreclosure rescue scams by making false promises. Scammers frequently claim they can lower mortgage payments or stop the foreclosure process.""
""Troubled homeowners lose time and money when they are tricked by con artists who promise to help but never do,"" said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""This initiative combines the collective energies of public and private enterprises to strengthen the ability of law enforcement to prosecute scammers and protect homeowners.""
The Loan Modification Scam Prevention Network, a national coalition of public and private enterprises, is led by the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the Homeownership Preservation Foundation, and NeighborWorks America assist the Lawyers' Committee in leading the coalition's fight against loan modification scams.
The Network developed PreventLoanScams.org (www.preventloanscams.org/) to provide homeowners with a single destination to report alleged scammers. Complaints filed online are added to a national complaint database and forwarded to the appropriate law enforcement agencies for review. The Network estimates that the website will assist approximately 50,000 homeowners affected by scams. Additionally, HUD has directed its local fair housing and housing counseling grantees to begin reporting alleged loan modification scams via the website.
The creation of a national complaint database is a major step in the fight against loan modification scams. Prior to the launch of PreventLoanScams.org, federal, state, and local government agencies could not share complaint data with non-profit organizations. The new system allows for better analysis of trends across jurisdictional lines and will likely lead to an increase in private enforcement action filings."
03/01/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-042.cfm,HUD Announces $13 Million in Grants to Protect Thousands of Children from Lead Paint and Other Hazards in Their Homes,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today is awarding more than $13 million in grants to 25 local projects to conduct a wide range of activities that include eliminating lead and housing-related hazards in thousands of homes; training workers in lead and healthy homes interventions; supporting research to improve home safety efforts; increasing public awareness, and evaluating outreach on controlling housing-based hazards.
Lead is a known toxin that can impair children's development and have effects lasting into adulthood. The incidence of asthma linked directly to housing-related hazards costs the U.S. economy approximately $3.5 billion each year.
""Every child deserves to grow up in a healthy home and yet far too many continue to be exposed to potentially dangerous lead and other health hazards,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""These grants will not only help to clean up lead and other home health hazards but will support innovative new approaches to make all our homes healthier places to live.""
""To grow up healthy, children need to live in healthy homes,"" said HUD Deputy Secretary Ron Sims. ""Housing is both a critical sector of our economy as well as a key source of wealth, security and stability for America's families.""
In the past year HUD has awarded over $232 million in Lead and Healthy Homes grants, including $100 million under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act; $116 million in Lead Hazard Control and Lead Hazard Reduction Demonstration grants; and $13 million in this announcement for Healthy Homes, Tech Studies and Green Initiatives.
The following is a breakdown of the funding announced today:
Through the four programs, HUD's Office of Healthy Homes and Lead Hazard Control promotes local efforts to eliminate dangerous lead and other key housing-related hazards from lower income homes; stimulates private sector investment in lead hazard control; and educates the public about the dangers of lead-based paint as well as other housing related health hazards. A complete project-by-project summary of the programs awarded grants today can be found on HUD's website.
Even though lead-based paint was banned for use in the home in 1978, HUD estimates that approximately 24 million homes still have significant lead-based paint hazards today. Lead-contaminated dust is the primary cause of lead exposure and can lead to a variety of health problems in young children, including reduced IQ, learning disabilities, developmental delays, reduced height, and impaired hearing. At higher levels, lead can damage a child's kidneys and central nervous system and cause anemia, coma, convulsions and even death. However, lead is not the only danger threatening families and children in the home. Asthma is now recognized as the leading cause of school and work absences, emergency room visits, and hospitalizations.
The funding announced today includes more than $13 million to cities, counties, tribes, universities and non-profit agencies to eliminate dangerous lead and healthy homes hazards in thousands of privately owned, low-income housing units. These funds are provided through HUD's Lead Hazard Control Capacity Building, Healthy Homes Demonstration, Healthy Homes Technical Studies and Green and Healthy Homes Technical Studies grant programs. Seven of the awardees are first-time grantees, receiving approximately $618,000 in an initiative to expand the reach of HUD's Lead Hazard Control programs and build capacity within the areas to eliminate lead and other home hazards.
HUD is providing an additional $6.1 million to help communities address and eliminate healthy homes hazards. For the first time, HUD will also award $2.4 million in Green and Healthy Homes Technical Studies cooperative agreements to improve knowledge of the effects green residential construction has on indoor environmental quality and occupant health, with a particular focus on children and other sensitive populations in low income households. Finally, HUD will award over $4 million in Healthy Homes Technical Studies cooperative agreements to improve methods to protect children and other sensitive populations from residential hazards.
NOTE: The state-by-state breakdown of the funding announced today, and complete individual project summaries, are available on HUD's website."
03/04/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-043.cfm,HUD Charges New York Landlords with Discriminating Against Veteran with Disabilities,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today announced that it is charging two Poughkeepsie, New York-area landlords with violating the Fair Housing Act for allegedly refusing to allow a Vietnam-era veteran suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder to have a therapeutic service dog in his apartment. In addition, HUD's charge contends that the landlords, Gerald and Patrick Paribelli, who manage and own the Apartment Buildings of South Street Builders, Inc., in Highland, NY, retaliated against the veteran by threatening to evict him because he filed a housing discrimination complaint.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to refuse to grant persons with disabilities reasonable accommodations, such as changes to rules, policies or practices that allow them to fully enjoy their home. The Fair Housing Act also prohibits coercing, intimidating, threatening, or interfering with a person for having exercised their fair housing rights.
""Every day, the men and women of our armed services risk their lives to defend our freedom,"" said John Trasviña, Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""It's our duty to ensure that our service members, as well as everyone who calls America home, have access to safe and affordable housing, free from discrimination. HUD will continue to vigorously enforce our nation's fair housing laws on behalf of our nation's veterans and those currently serving.""
In his complaint, which was filed with HUD and the New York State Division of Human Rights, the resident alleged that the owners failed to grant his request for a reasonable accommodation when they denied his use of a service animal doctors had prescribed to reduce his post-traumatic stress, depression and seizures. Although one of the owners acknowledged that he had heard of assistance animals being used to treat these disorders, the landlords denied the tenant's requests for a therapeutic service dog because his apartment building had a ""no-pets"" policy. HUD's charge of discrimination also asserts that the landlords told the tenant that he would need to start looking for another place to live because he had filed a housing discrimination complaint.
The HUD charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an ALJ finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, the ALJ may award damages to the complainant for the damages suffered as a result of the discrimination. The ALJ may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief to deter further discrimination, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the ALJ may impose civil penalties in order to vindicate the public interest. A federal district court judge may also award punitive damages to the complainant.

Donovan and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner sent a letter to U.S. Senator Mary Landrieu earlier this week, expressing the Administration's support of the amendment she sponsored and was adopted today.
""I want to applaud the United States Senate and Senator Mary Landrieu in particular, for taking this important step toward the Gulf Coast's continued revitalization. The GO Zone tax credits have driven redevelopment efforts and stimulated local economies in these devastated areas, helping to enable families to return to their communities more quickly. GO Zone projects have created jobs and helped to return much needed affordable housing to the Gulf Coast. In New Orleans specifically, the tax credits have been particularly important to help leverage financing to restore affordable housing in the 'Big Four' public housing developments: St. Bernard, C.J. Pete, Lafitte, and B.W. Cooper. The Obama Administration is committed to ensuring that the tragedy of disasters and their aftermaths leads to better housing and stronger neighborhoods. We don't want to rebuild the Big Four as they existed before, we want to rebuild them better, smarter, and safer. The extension of the GO Zone credits will provide the flexibility for new developments to serve as economic engines for communities that are more viable. We now have an opportunity, not only revitalize New Orleans, but also to use the Crescent City as a model for building more livable, accessible, and sustainable cities across the country.""

03/08/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-044.cfm,HUD Steps Up Enforcement of Job Creation Requirements for State and Local Governments,"WASHINGTON - More than 3,100 state and local government agencies have responded to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's campaign to expand hiring and contracting opportunities for low-income persons. As a result of the effort, three out of four HUD-funded state and local agencies submitted required annual reports, the largest response since HUD made Section 3 reporting mandatory.
""HUD's mission is to invest in people as well as buildings,"" said John Trasviña, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""This initiative is a huge step toward creating job opportunities for low- and very low-income individuals and ensuring that state and local governments partner with HUD.""
In October 2009, HUD contacted more than 3,500 agencies to remind them of their legal obligations to report their hiring and contracting efforts. Under Section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968, state and local governments that receive HUD funding are required to report how they use the funding to hire low- and very low-income individuals and public housing residents. Agencies are also, ""to the greatest extent feasible,"" required to contract with companies that hire the residents.
Requiring recipients of HUD funding to report is the initial step in an aggressive two-year Section 3 Implementation Plan to increase hiring and training opportunities. Assisting local and state agencies with implementing and reporting on their Section 3 activities also includes holding them accountable when they fail to do so. For example, under a Voluntary Compliance Agreement (VCA) the city of St. Paul, MN reached with HUD, the city will direct $1 million to build the capacity of low-income individuals and businesses to participate in housing construction projects over the next four years.
Specific programs under the VCA will include training on the city's project development process, construction job preparation, and a no-interest revolving loan fund for Section 3 business concerns. In addition, St. Paul will establish a scholarship fund to help low-income persons pay for such job related expenses as union initiation fees and dues, tools, equipment and work clothing.
HUD will continue to work with labor, business, vocational, educational, and community organizations to help workers become trained and eligible for job opportunities. In 2008, HUD funding generated more than 17,000 new employment and training opportunities for Section 3 residents and facilitated the award of more than $340 million in HUD-funded construction contracts to Section 3 businesses. The funding also enabled about 3,600 Section 3 businesses to receive contracts to complete work on HUD-funded projects.
In addition, HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity has conducted trainings for thousands of HUD recipients, responded to hundreds of requests from state and local governments for technical assistance, and published new guidance materials on its Web site. Future activities will include awarding eight competitive grants ranging from $50,000 to $100,000 to help local governments hire Section 3 coordinators.

On Monday, President Obama issued a disaster declaration for Calaveras, Imperial, Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino, and Siskiyou Counties. The President's declaration allows HUD to offer foreclosure relief and other assistance to certain families living in this county.
""Families who may have been forced from their homes need to know that help is available to begin the rebuilding process,"" said Donovan. ""Whether it's foreclosure relief for FHA-insured families or helping these counties to recover, HUD stands ready to help in any way we can.""
HUD is:

The White House Office of Urban Affairs, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Agency for International Development, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture launched the interagency website featuring World Urban Forum (WUF) roundtable discussions, web chats, presentations, and workshops at www.hud.gov/wuf.
Organized by the United Nations' Human Settlement Programme (UN-Habitat), the WUF will be held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil from March 22 - 26. Every two years this world forum is dedicated to examining the most pressing problems related to urban issues.
HUD Secretary, and head of the U.S. delegation, Shaun Donovan said, ""This is a time of great challenge and great opportunity when it comes to addressing the next generation of housing and sustainability issues facing the nations of the world. Though we may have competing interests, it is possible to work as one to steer toward housing solutions that offer all of us a more inclusive, sustainable, and greener world.""
""The rapid rate of urbanization is a key factor in global stability and growth. At the World Urban Forum, we will address the range of crucial human security issues associated with this significant demographic transition"" said Under Secretary of State for Democracy and Global Affairs María Otero.
""Last year, President Obama called on every nation to share responsibility for creating global solutions to global challenges,"" said Adolfo Carrión, Jr., Director of the White House Office of Urban Affairs and Deputy Assistant to the President. ""We can no longer afford to confront 21st Century urban challenges with a 20th Century vision. We need to address urban development to reflect the way people live and will live, both in the United States and around the world.""
The new interagency website also emphasizes the Obama Administration's focus on addressing challenges collaboratively amongst agencies. The site will be used by the U.S. WUF Delegation to publicize U.S. initiatives on urban development, give the public open access to information on the U.S. government's international agenda/outreach efforts and engage with the public through the use of social media tools such as blogs and social network sites."
03/12/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-048.cfm,"""Neighborhood Stabilization Boot Camp"" to Draw Top Officials from 12 Cities and the Obama Administration","BOSTON - Dozens of local officials from 12 of the regions hit hardest by the housing crisis are meeting at Harvard University March 14 -16 to develop new strategies for stabilizing neighborhoods that experience large numbers of foreclosures.
The Boot Camp will convene teams of government officials, nonprofits and real estate firms from Baltimore; Chicago; Cuyahoga County (OH); Denver; Los Angeles; Michigan; Massachusetts; New Orleans; Philadelphia; Phoenix; South Florida; and Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota where promising approaches are taking hold, along with the largest national mortgage lenders and servicers such as Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup and Deutsche Bank. Senior officials from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, U.S. Department of Treasury, FHA, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac will also participate.
""The Neighborhood Stabilization Boot Camp"" is sponsored by Living Cities together with the Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation at the John F. Kennedy School at Harvard University. Living Cities, an innovative philanthropic collaborative of 22 of the world's largest foundations and financial institutions, hopes that the intensive, two-day session will result in a dramatic increase in the speed and scale of smarter, more sustainable neighborhood stabilization by:
Helping to define new strategies that will have a material impact on targeted neighborhoods; Sharing ""game-changing"" practices that will accelerate keeping units occupied and putting property vacant units back into productive use Significantly leveraging the more than $6 billion in federal funds, with an emphasis on accessing larger and more flexible amounts of private capital
• Helping to define new strategies that will have a material impact on targeted neighborhoods;
• Sharing ""game-changing"" practices that will accelerate keeping units occupied and putting property vacant units back into productive use
• Significantly leveraging the more than $6 billion in federal funds, with an emphasis on accessing larger and more flexible amounts of private capital
""Everyone, from government agencies and nonprofits to financial institutions and foundations, are frustrated by our collective inability to get stabilization efforts to scale. This Boot Camp is a direct response to that frustration,"" said Ben Hecht, President and CEO of Living Cities.
The neighborhood-level impacts of concentrated foreclosures can be devastating: blight, depressed property values, diminished property tax collections and a reduction in municipal services - a negative feedback loop that repeats and worsens. In 2009 alone, foreclosures have may have reduced property values of nearby homes—most owned by families paying their mortgage on time—by more than $500 billion, according to the Center for Responsible Lending.
""It's important that government at every level, along with the private sector and non-profit community, ramp up our collective effort to confront the foreclosure crisis head on,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""The scale of this challenge demands that we redouble our efforts to stabilize neighborhoods and restore a real sense of sustainability to our American Dream.""
Mercedes Márquez, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development added, ""Boot camp is the perfect descriptive for this meeting and how we have to address the foreclosure and abandonment crisis taking place in far too many neighborhoods. All of us need to roll up our sleeves, get our hands dirty, and do the heavy lifting that's required if we're going to revitalize these communities.""

03/15/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-050.cfm,"HUD Approves New York City Housing Authority Proposal to Improve, Preserve Affordable Housing for Thousands Across the City","NEW YORK - U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan stood with New York elected officials and housing authority representatives today at Rutgers Houses in Lower Manhattan to announce HUD's final approval of a financial transaction that will keep the 721 public housing and Section 8 units at Rutgers Houses affordable, as well as thousands of similar apartments throughout the city.
This approval will provide public and private funds to rehabilitate a total of 20,139 units in 21 public housing developments in New York City and provide ongoing federal operating subsidy from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for 11,743 of the public housing units in the 21 developments. Joining Donovan today were Governor David Paterson, Senator Charles Schumer, Congresswoman Nydia Velazquez, Mayor Michael Bloomberg and New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) Chairman John Rhea.
""HUD is proud to join with the State, the City and NYCHA to safeguard affordable housing for thousands of families well into the future,"" said Secretary Donovan. ""HUD's approval of this agreement and the funding the Obama administration is providing through the Recovery Act will not only help the families who live in these apartments, but will create hundreds of jobs and ensure necessary repairs can take place. This one agreement will benefit roughly the same number of public housing units in New York City as there are in the whole of Chicago's public housing inventory. This is a great day for the future of New York City's public housing.""
Donovan and Rhea signed documents today that conclude a complex, multi-step process that gives NYCHA the go ahead to use $108 million it received from HUD though the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act), in addition to other funds, to rehabilitate the 20,139 units covered by the agreement. Last year, HUD awarded 3,400 public housing authorities nearly $3 billion in Recovery Act funding to make capital improvements to their public housing stock. NYCHA received $423 million in this funding.
In February 2010, HUD approved NYCHA's proposal to enter into two mixed-finance transactions that called for the New York Housing Development Corporation to issue bonds on the private market to raise capital that will be combined with the Recovery Act funding to accelerate the rehabilitation of these units. Citibank, N.A., a limited partner in one of the two transactions, will invest approximately $209 million to purchase low-income housing tax credits awarded to the development. The State of New York will also provide $42 million.
The 20,139 units that will be rehabilitated using Recovery Act and private and public funds were constructed from 1949 to 1978 using New York City and New York State obligation bonds. For almost a decade, these units were solely owned, managed and maintained by NYCHA without operating funding from the State or City of New York. HUD gave NYCHA approval in 1995 to bring the 21 developments under the housing authority's federal portfolio of public housing units, which allowed NYCHA to use its federal subsidies to maintain the housing. However, this arrangement was draining resources that are allocated to maintain NYCHA's original federal public housing units.
In 2008, HUD approved NYCHA's request to convert 8,400 units of the 20,139 former state units from public housing to the Housing Choice Voucher Program (HCV) or for non-dwelling use. Under the approval, beginning in fiscal year 2011, the remaining 11,743 units will be eligible to receive HUD operating subsidies, which NYCHA and housing authorities nationwide receive annually to maintain affordable housing for low-income families. HUD estimates, NYCHA will receive between $65 and $75 million more in operating subsidies to maintain these units. NYCHA's received approximately $991 million in operating funding in 2009.
The remaining units, 6,160 will be public housing, but will not receive federal subsidy. NYCHA will continue to provide operating subsidy for those units from other sources, such as federal subsidy provided to its remaining portfolio and sales proceeds and fees received during the development process. NYCHA has already converted 2,236 units to the HCV program and has been given the option to further convert them to project-based vouchers in the future."

03/17/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-052.cfm,HUD Launches Website to Gather Public Comment on First-Ever LGBT Housing Discrimination Study,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today launched a new website to allow citizens to offer comment on the design of an unprecedented national study that will examine housing discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. While there have been no national assessments of housing discrimination targeting the lesbian, gay, bi-sexual and transgender (LGBT) community, there is a body of evidence suggesting this sort of bias exists.
HUD recently hosted town hall meetings in Chicago, San Francisco and New York City to solicit feedback on how it might approach such ground-breaking research. This 'online suggestion box' is intended to offer the public throughout the U.S. an opportunity to comment on HUD's study.
""It is critical that as we embark on this historic discrimination study, that we hear from those who may have been denied housing based on their sexual orientation or gender identity,"" said Dr. Raphael Bostic, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research. ""The comments we received in our town hall meetings, and those we will gather from this new website, will help inform how we might test for housing discrimination in the sale or rental of housing based on LBGT status.""
While there are no national assessments of LGBT housing discrimination, there are state and local studies that have shown this sort of bias. For example, Michigan's Fair Housing Centers found that nearly 30 percent of same-sex couples were treated differently when attempting to buy or rent a home (www.fhcmichigan.org/images/Arcus_web1.pdf).
HUD's new LGBT website will seek suggestions on how best to execute the study. For example, how would a 'tester' signal in a conversation with a landlord that an individual or couple was LGBT? The website is not designed for users to lodge complaints about a particular incident. However, if you believe you have been a victim of housing discrimination, you may file an online complaint, or call HUD's Housing Discrimination Hotline at 1-800-669-9777."
03/18/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-053.cfm,FHA Hires Compliance Manager to Oversee Inventory of 'HUD Homes',"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced the agency is contracting with Michaelson, Connor Boul, Inc. (MCB) of Huntington Beach, California to serve as a Mortgagee Compliance Manager. MCB will be responsible for ensuring that Federal Housing Administration (FHA)-approved lenders and loan servicers convey foreclosed properties to the FHA in acceptable condition.
MCB will establish a central office for lender compliance oversight in Oklahoma City, which is projected to create 75 - 100 new professional jobs. HUD's National Servicing Center (NSC) in Oklahoma City will be responsible for the direct oversight of the new compliance manager contract.
""This new contract is part of FHA's continuing effort to reduce risk, increase return, and improve efficiency in the resale of its inventory of foreclosed property,"" said HUD Deputy Assistant Secretary Vicki Bott. ""It is critically important that FHA recaptures as much of our claims through the eventual sale of these properties and this compliance management firm will help us do that.""
The contract is awarded under FHA's Management and Marketing (M) III disposition structure. Under M III, the process of conveying foreclosed properties to FHA has been centralized and streamlined in order to simplify the process for FHA's lenders and servicers, as well as to improve communication and the dissemination of program guidance and requirements.
As the largest seller of real estate in the country, HUD has been outsourcing the disposition of its foreclosed FHA inventory under the M contracting process since 1999. After conducting extensive research into market-based best practices, HUD has developed its new M III disposition structure to streamline its operations, capitalize on the expertise of potential vendors and provide flexibility in a changing environment.
Under M III, lenders and loan servicers seeking to convey foreclosed properties to FHA will find a more efficient and less complex process than under previous M contracts. Michaelson, Connor Boul, Inc will serve as the sole entity responsible for mortgagee compliance.
Any questions or clarification regarding this contract award should be directed to the HUD National Servicing Center at (888) 297-8685."
03/24/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-056.cfm,"3,100 Public Housing Authorities Meet Critical Recovery Act Deadline, Create Nearly 9,000 Jobs and Rehab 150,000 Homes for Low-Income Families","WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan today announced that over 3,100 public housing authorities across the U.S. successfully met a critical funding deadline outlined in the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). As a result, the nearly $3 billion in Public Housing Capital Fund grants awarded through the Recovery Act one year ago are being used to make significant improvements to tens of thousands of public housing units nationwide; creating jobs and growing the economy.
""Strict deadlines, such as this one, were written into the Recovery Act to ensure that funds would be used to meet the top goal of putting Americans back to work as quickly as possible,"" said Donovan. ""I am proud of the work HUD and public housing authorities across the country did to meet this critical deadline. It speaks to the commitment they have to improve affordable housing and grow local economies. Families and communities are already seeing new windows, roofs, cost-saving energy-efficient appliances, and much-needed jobs.""
To date, as a result of this critical Recovery Act funding, public housing authorities reported creating or retaining nearly 9,000 jobs and developing or rehabilitating 150,000 public housing units in hard-hit neighborhoods throughout the country. Just one year after being awarded, Recovery Act public housing funds, which were intended to help jumpstart the economy during the worst recession in a generation, are also allowing housing agencies to address the long-standing capital needs of public housing, create jobs, and increase energy efficiency.
On March 17, 2009, less than 30 days after the Recovery Act was signed into law, HUD provided nearly $3 billion in Public Housing Capital funds to over 3,100 public housing authorities nationwide. The funds were allocated through an established formula, effectively more than doubling the Department's annual support of local housing authorities. Specific guidelines in the law required that all funding awarded to public housing authorities through the Recovery Act be ""obligated,"" or committed to specific projects or activities, one year after it was awarded, or the funding must be recaptured by HUD and redistributed to other agencies in compliance with the requirements.
All public housing authorities were able to meet that deadline by either obligating 100 percent of their funds or voluntarily returning all or a portion of their funds by the deadline. Of the $2.985 billion that was awarded to 3,134 public housing authorities, $2.981 billion has been obligated and $3.246 million was voluntarily returned. HUD is currently determining the redistribution process for the funding returned. The 172 'troubled' housing authorities that received funding all met the deadline as well, with only two troubled agencies returning all or a portion of their funds by March 17th.
HUD's Capital Fund Program provides annual funding to public housing authorities to develop, finance, and/or modernize the public housing in their communities. This funding can be used to make large-scale improvements such as new roofs and for the replacement of plumbing and electrical systems to increase energy efficiency.
The Recovery Act included $13.61 billion for projects and programs administered by HUD, nearly 75 percent of which was allocated to state and local recipients only eight days after President Obama signed the Act into law, including public housing capital funding. The remaining 25 percent is being awarded through competitive grant programs. To date, 98 percent of HUD's Recovery Act funds are in the hands of local communities, being used to improve housing and neighborhoods, while creating jobs. HUD is committed to implementing Recovery Act investments swiftly and effectively as they generate tens of thousands of jobs, modernize homes to make them energy efficient, and help the families and communities hardest hit by the economic crisis.
In addition, Secretary Donovan and the Department are committed to providing the highest level of transparency possible as Recovery Act funds are administered. It is vitally important that the American people are fully aware of how their tax dollars are being spent and can hold their federal leaders accountable. Every dollar of Recovery Act funds HUD spends can be reviewed and tracked at HUD's Recovery Act website. The full text of HUD's funding notices and tracking of future performance of these grants is also available at HUD's Recovery Act website."
03/25/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-055.cfm,HUD Releases Groundbreaking Study on Costs of First-Time Homelessness for Individuals and Families,"WASHINGTON - When an individual or a family becomes homeless for the first time, the cost of providing them housing and services can vary widely, from $581 a month for an individual's stay in an emergency shelter in Des Moines, Iowa to as much as $3,530 for a family's monthly stay in emergency shelter in Washington, D.C. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today released three studies on the cost of 'first-time' homelessness; life after transitional housing for homeless families; and strategies for improving access to mainstream benefits programs.
HUD's cost study is the most comprehensive research on the price tag associated with first-time homelessness and creates a foundation to compare the costs of various homeless interventions. Taken together, HUD's three studies released today will inform policy discussions on what are the most effective strategies for assisting homeless persons and families in the future.
""These studies expand our knowledge of the true costs of homelessness and raises other questions that go far beyond dollars and cents,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""Now we need to have a serious discussion over what strategies are not only most cost effective, but how we can help individuals and families from falling into homelessness in the first place.""
HUD's study, Costs Associated with First-Time Homelessness for Families and Individuals (www.huduser.org/portal/publications/povsoc/cost_homelessness.html), examines how much it costs to house and serve nearly 9,000 individuals and families in six areas of the country. The report studies the cost of first-time homelessness among individuals in Des Moines, Iowa; Houston, Texas; and Jacksonville, Florida. In addition, the Department looked at the cost of first-time family homelessness in Washington, DC; Houston, Texas; Kalamazoo, Michigan; and a large area of upstate South Carolina.
HUD is currently investing $1.5 billion in funding through the Recovery Act's Homeless Prevention and Rapid Re-Housing Program (HPRP), to prevent individuals and families from becoming homeless and help those who are experiencing homelessness to be quickly re-housed and stabilized.
This report reveals that most of those individuals and families studied experience homelessness only once or twice and use emergency shelter for a limited period of time at fairly low cost. However, HUD also found that some of these households experience longer periods of homelessness and use more expensive programs. While overnight emergency shelter for individuals have the lowest costs, these shelters offer the fewest services in the least private settings and are often open only during evening hours. By contrast, transitional housing is the most expensive model for individuals, frequently offering more privacy and a comprehensive range of on-site services.
HUD's cost study found:

HUD also released two additional homeless studies today: Life after Transitional Housing for Homeless Families (www.huduser.org/portal/publications/povsoc/trans_hsg.html)
This study follows 195 families in 36 transitional housing programs in five communities for three, six and 12 months after leaving the program. Given the significant investment HUD makes in transitional housing programs, and in light of the program's costs mentioned above, it is important to understand the effectiveness of these programs. The five study communities were Cleveland/Cuyahoga County, Ohio; Detroit, Michigan; Houston and Harris and Benton Counties, Texas; San Diego City and County, California; and Seattle/King County, Washington. Among the study's findings:
Participants in smaller transitional housing programs were more likely to have their own place to live after moveout and more likely to live with the same household members at the beginning and end of the follow-up year. Participants in larger programs experience higher levels of educational attainment at moveout.

03/26/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-057.cfm,HUD Program Brings Seniors Back Home to New Orleans,"WASHINGTON - Thanks to a little-known federal program, 46 low-income seniors who were displaced by Hurricane Katrina received a grand welcome home celebration today in New Orleans at the Terraces on Tulane senior housing community that will ultimately house 200 families.
Carol Galante, U.S. Housing and Urban Development Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Office of Multifamily Housing, joined Charles W. Gould, Volunteers of America (VOA) National President and Jim LeBlanc, CEO of VOA's Greater New Orleans area office for the grand opening of the new senior housing community that replaced Forest Towers East that was severely damaged by Hurricane Katrina.
""The work that was done to bring these families home illustrates HUD and the Obama Administration's commitment to do whatever it takes to ensure families in New Orleans and the Gulf Coast region truly recover from the devastation of Katrina and Rita,"" said Galante. ""The smiles I see and the laughter I hear today among these families tells me it was well worth all of our efforts.""
Prior to Hurricane Katrina, the families who lived in Forest Towers East received rental subsidy through HUD's Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly Program. After it was determined that the hurricane damage rendered Forest Towers East uninhabitable, employees in HUD's New Orleans and Fort Worth, Tex. field offices and Headquarters worked closely with VOA to use HUD's Section 318 Program. The little-known program was used to transfer the HUD subsidy the residents received at Forest Towers East to the new $43 million facility. The Section 318 Program has been used less than a dozen times since it was created in 2006.
The new location, which includes a state-of-the-art security and a comprehensive care to residents, also positions the families in the midst of a renaissance of growth and development with access to hospitals, clinics, grocery stores, banking and entertainment."
03/26/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-058.cfm,Housing Program Enhancements Offer Additional Options for Struggling Homeowners,"WASHINGTON - Today, as part of its ongoing commitment to continuously improve housing relief efforts, the Administration announced adjustments to the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) and to the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) programs. These program adjustments will better assist responsible homeowners who have been affected by the economic crisis through no fault of their own. The program modifications will expand flexibility for mortgage servicers and originators to assist more unemployed homeowners and to help more people who owe more on their mortgage than their home is worth because their local markets saw large declines in home values. These changes will help the Administration meet its goal of stabilizing housing markets by offering a second chance to up to 3 to 4 million struggling homeowners through the end of 2012. Costs will be shared between the private sector and the Federal Government; the Federal cost of these changes will be funded through the $50 billion allocation for housing programs under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP).
Housing Policy Overview
The Administration's goal is to promote stability for both the housing market and homeowners. To meet these objectives, the Administration has developed a comprehensive approach using state and local housing agency initiatives, tax credits for homebuyers, neighborhood stabilization and community development programs, mortgage modifications and refinancing, and support for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The Administration's efforts for homeowners have focused on giving responsible households an opportunity to remain in their homes when possible while they get back up on their feet, or to relocate to a more sustainable living situation. Today, mortgage rates are at record lows and, thanks in large part to these programs, more than four million homeowners have refinanced their mortgages to more affordable levels helping to save more than $7 billion annually, more than one million are saving an average of over $500 per month through the Administration's modification program, home equity increased by more than $12,000 for the average homeowner in the last three quarters last year and the economy is growing.
Even with this success, we continue to see challenges. Servicers were slow to implement HAMP, resulting in a slow start for the program. Recent improvements in the program have accelerated the pace of modifications, and the adjustments announced today will improve performance. But our strategy to address the crisis must evolve because our challenges have also evolved.
Our housing initiatives must balance the need to help responsible homeowners struggling to stay in their homes, with the recognition that we cannot and should not help everyone. The President has said: ""We can't stop every foreclosure."" And in fact, we can't maintain the balance described above if we assist every borrower. For example, investors and speculators should not be protected under our efforts, nor should Americans living in million dollar homes or defaulters on vacation homes. Some people simply will not be able to afford to stay in their homes because they bought more than they could afford. Instead, the Administration must focus on providing responsible homeowners opportunities to obtain a modification or to refinance and prevent avoidable foreclosures and, when necessary, must facilitate the transition to a more sustainable housing situation. The adjustments announced today are tailored to accomplish these goals by helping a targeted group of borrowers.
Eligible homeowners for modifications under HAMP must, for example: live in an owner occupied principal residence, have a mortgage balance less than $729,750, owe monthly mortgage payments that are not affordable (greater than 31 percent of their income) and demonstrate a financial hardship. The new flexibilities for the modification initiative announced today continue to target this group of homeowners.
The FHA refinance options being announced today will provide more opportunities for lenders to restructure loans for some families who owe more than their home is worth. This is a voluntary program for lenders and homeowners. The population eligible for a FHA refinance must be current on their mortgage. This rewards responsible homeowners and creates stabilizing incentives in the housing market.
Taken together, the Administration's broad housing initiatives and the new flexibilities announced today will offer a second chance to millions of responsible, middle-class American families struggling to stay in their homes and will help to stabilize our households, neighborhoods and communities.
Background on Housing Program Initiatives to Date
The Administration has taken a broad set of actions to stabilize the housing market and help American homeowners. These efforts are having an impact on our housing markets - we are seeing signs of stabilization. Looking back to over a year ago - stress in the financial system had severely reduced the supply of mortgage credit, limiting the ability of Americans to buy homes or refinance mortgages. Millions of responsible families who had made their monthly payments had fulfilled their obligations saw their property values fall, and found themselves unable to refinance at lower mortgage rates.
In February 2009, less than one month after taking office, President Obama announced the Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan. As part of this plan and through other housing initiatives, the Administration has taken the following actions to strengthen the housing market:
Provided strong support to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to ensure continued access to affordable mortgage credit across the market; Together, Treasury and the Federal Reserve have purchased more than $1.4 trillion in agency mortgage backed securities, which have helped keep mortgage rates at historic lows, allowing homeowners to access credit to purchase new homes and refinance into more affordable monthly payments; and The FHA has played an important counter-cyclical role, providing liquidity for housing purchases at a time when private lending has declined.

• The FHA has played an important counter-cyclical role, providing liquidity for housing purchases at a time when private lending has declined.
Launched a modification initiative to help homeowners reduce mortgage payments to affordable levels and to prevent avoidable foreclosures; Supported expanding the limits for loans guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and FHA from previous limits up to $625,500 per loan to $729,750; Expanded refinancing flexibilities for the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans, particularly for borrowers with negative equity, to allow more Americans to refinance; Launched a $23.5 billion Housing Finance Agencies Initiative which is helping more than 90 state and local housing finance agencies across 49 states provide sustainable homeownership and rental resources for American families; Supported the First Time Homebuyer Tax Credit, which has helped hundreds of thousands of responsible Americans purchase homes. Through the Recovery Act is providing over $5 billion in support for affordable rental housing through low income housing tax credit programs and $2 billion in support for the Neighborhood Stabilization Program to restore neighborhoods hardest hit by concentrated foreclosures; and On February 19, 2010, the Administration announced the $1.5 billion HFA Hardest Hit Fund for housing finance agencies in the nation's hardest hit housing markets to design innovative, locally targeted foreclosure prevention programs.

Historically low mortgage rates along with expanded refinancing flexibilities for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans have helped more than four million American homeowners with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans to refinance, saving an estimated $150 per month on average and more than $7 billion in total. HAMP has provided more than 1 million struggling homeowners a second chance to stay in their homes - with each homeowner in a modification saving more than $500 per month on average.
Together, these initiatives are having an impact - strengthening the housing market, helping responsible homeowners prevent avoidable foreclosures and rebuilding communities and neighborhoods. Today mortgage rates remain at historic lows - the primary interest rate is now about 5 percent, lower than at any time in the three decades before the crisis. We are also seeing encouraging signs in housing indicators - home prices and the pace of home sales have stabilized in recent months.

Funded through HUD's Housing Choice Voucher Family Self-Sufficiency Program (HCV/FSS), the grants allow public housing agencies (PHAs) to work with welfare agencies, schools, businesses, and other local partners to develop a comprehensive program to help participating individuals develop the skills and experience to enable them to obtain jobs that pay a living wage.
""In today's economy, this program is needed more than ever to help families obtain the skills that lead to jobs,"" said Donovan. ""On the heels of President Obama signing the jobs bill that will boost job creation, I'm pleased HUD is providing this funding to local housing authorities that will keep caseworkers on the job to assist families in HUD's voucher program find employment.""
Local housing authorities use the funding to hire family self-sufficiency coordinators to link adults in the Housing Choice Voucher program to local organizations that provide job training, childcare, counseling, transportation and job placement. These housing authorities can also hire coordinators to help families get homeownership counseling.
Participants in the HCV/FSS program sign a contract that requires the head of the household will get a job and the family will no longer receive welfare assistance at the end of the five-year term. As the family's income rises, a portion of that increased income is deposited in an interest-bearing escrow account. If the family completes its FSS contract, the family receives the escrow funds that it can use for any purpose, including a down payment on a home, paying educational expenses, starting a business or paying back debts."

The $166.9 million loan is made possible through the Federal Housing Administration's (FHA) Section 242 Hospital Mortgage Insurance Program.
The project will include construction of a new eight-story hospital with helipad and parking garage. The facility will have 23 emergency department beds and 103 inpatient beds. It will have a fully operational surgery department and six operating rooms, two endoscopy rooms, and two pain management rooms.
""FHA is helping to build state-of-the-art health care facilities like this all across the country,"" said FHA Commissioner David Stevens. ""By helping to make these projects possible, FHA also contributes to the financial well-being of communities by creating jobs and helping to stimulate local economies.""
HUD estimates the Lakeway Regional Medical Center construction project will support 2,429 full-time jobs and provide an estimated economic stimulus of more than $450 million to the community. Once completed, it is estimated the project will support 1,871 full-time jobs and provide an annual economic benefit of more than $308 million.
By insuring the mortgage loan, FHA is enabling the hospital to obtain lower cost financing that will save an estimated $91.2 million in interest expense over the life of the loan. Since 1968, FHA has insured 358 mortgages to hospitals throughout the nation, 45 within the past five years.
The new hospital will be a critical component of a larger development project that includes plans for three medical office buildings, a hotel to accommodate outpatients, a children's day care center, retail spaces, and an additional parking garage.
FHA's Section 242 Mortgage Insurance Program for Hospitals provides HUD-insured mortgages made by private lending institutions to finance construction or renovation of acute care hospitals including major equipment needed to operate the facility.

The permanent withdrawal of RSA's FHA approval is based upon violations set forth in a Notice of Violation dated December 4, 2009. RSA's application to FHA contained false and/or materially misleading information in connection with RSA's failure to obtain proper licensing in the State of Georgia and in connection with Agan's history of criminal convictions and administrative sanctions. Specifically, RSA represented that company officials ""are neither currently, nor have ever been, debarred, sanctioned, fined, convicted, denied approval, or refused a license by any State, Federal, or local government agency."" Agan has been suspended and debarred by HUD on at least two occasions and has two felony convictions.
In 1982, Agan pleaded guilty to two counts of knowingly submitting false statements for the purposes of influencing the actions of a federally insured bank. He was sentenced to two years in prison (suspended), two years of probation, and fined $10,000. These actions led to the permanent withdrawal of his former FHA-approved company, Adana Mortgage Bankers, and a five-year debarment of Agan. In 1988, Agan was convicted of multiple counts of bribery by a Georgia Court, causing HUD to debar Agan indefinitely. RSA has 30 days to challenge the withdrawal action before an administrative law judge.
1st Alliance Mortgage LLC
The permanent withdrawal of 1st Alliance's FHA approval is based on violations set forth in a Notice of Violation dated October 21, 2009. The MRB alleges that 1st Alliance used independent contractors to originate 708 loans from branch offices that were not true branches of the company and then falsely certified these contractors were full-time employees of the company. The MRB also contends 1st Alliance failed to adopt and maintain a required Quality Control Plan; failed to report employee compensation on IRS Form W-2; charged consumers unallowable, excessive or duplicative loan processing and origination fees; and failed to properly ensure that fees ""paid outside of closing"" were listed on borrowers HUD-1 Settlement Statements.
In addition to the withdrawal actions noted above, HUD also announced two settlement agreements with FHA-approved lenders to resolve alleged violations of HUD/FHA requirements:
Franklin First Financial, LTD.
Franklin First Financial, Ltd. (FFF) agreed to pay a civil penalty to HUD in the amount of $413,500 and indemnify HUD for any losses which have been or may be incurred with respect to 31 FHA-insured mortgages. HUD and the Melville, New York-based lender agreed that the company will pay FHA for any losses related to these loans if they are in default or go into default for up to five years after they were endorsed. FFF shall also reimburse 78 borrowers the cost of duplicate appraisals and appraisal reviews that the company performed in order to sell these mortgages on the secondary market.
Paramount Bond and Mortgage Co., Inc.
Paramount Bond and Mortgage Co., Inc. (Paramount) agreed to pay a civil penalty to HUD in the amount of $68,500 and indemnify HUD for any losses which have been or may be incurred with respect to seven FHA-insured mortgages. HUD and the St. Louis-based mortgage lender also agreed that the company repay FHA $146,397 in insurance claims already paid on two loans.
Today's actions are part of a broader enforcement effort by FHA against mortgage lenders for violating its requirements. Within the past year alone, FHA has suspended several high-volume FHA-approved lenders, including Taylor, Bean and Whitaker and withdrawn FHA-approval for 354 others, including Lend America and Financial Mortgage USA. That is a significant increase over 2008, when only 28 lenders lost their FHA-approval."
04/01/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-067.cfm,HUD Celebrates April as Fair Housing Month,"WASHINGTON - A Massachusetts family is billed by the landlord when children play in an outdoor common area and are fined when they file a fair housing complaint. An Alabama landlord is charged with turning off the water and evicting a white family because one tenant has an African-American boyfriend. An Illinois university student who is vision impaired and epileptic is refused dormitory housing because she has a trained service dog. HUD and private groups bring these and other discrimination cases under the Fair Housing Act, 42 years after it became law in April 1968. In honor of Fair Housing Month, celebrated each April, HUD has declared 2010 a ""Time to Act!""
The Fair Housing Act makes it illegal to discriminate in housing transactions based on race, color, national origin, religion, gender, disability, or familial status. Each year HUD and communities and organizations across the country recognize Fair Housing Month by hosting an array of activities that enhance the public's awareness of their fair housing rights and highlight the national commitment to end housing discrimination. The theme for this year's activities, ""Fair Housing in 2010: Time to Act,"" reflects the urgent need to ensure fair housing.
""Discrimination based on how you look, the religion you practice, or because you have children or are disabled is illegal and unacceptable,"" said John Trasviña, Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at HUD. ""In the aftermath of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination in April 1968, President Johnson moved for passage of the Fair Housing Act to bring the nation forward and together. Since then, we have made progress but there remains work to be done. It is time to act.""
HUD's fair housing initiatives include expanding its efforts to work with states and local communities to reinforce a federal requirement that they promote diverse, inclusive housing opportunities when spending federal funds. The Department, for the first time ever, is examining the prevalence of housing discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity and discrimination based on a tenant's use of government assistance to pay rent.
In the last year, HUD:
Brokered a landmark settlement agreement in a case that alleged Westchester County, New York, made false claims to the federal government when it made civil rights certifications required to receive funding. The certification requires the County to provide greater housing opportunities and choice for its minority residents in non-minority communities, free from discrimination. Westchester County subsequently agreed to build 750 units of affordable housing in areas with very low minority concentration. HUD and Westchester County are now working together to ensure that the settlement produces a clear strategy for promoting diverse, inclusive communities. Expanded its efforts to ensure that HUD dollars going to communities are invested in job opportunities for low-income residents and public housing residents, and contracts for companies employing them. Under Section 3 of the HUD Act, for the first time, over 3,000 state and local agencies are now reporting their job creation actions to HUD. Worked with local fair housing agencies to obtain more than $8 million in relief for victims of housing discrimination in lending, rental and sales of real property. In addition, HUD and these local agencies obtained other types of relief, including the creation of housing opportunities; changes in the policies and procedures of housing providers and lenders; reasonable accommodations or reasonable modifications for persons with disabilities; affirmative marketing of their housing opportunities; and fair housing training for housing providers. Unveiled an enhanced website to help individuals with limited English proficiency (LEP) gain greater access to HUD programs and activities. HUD's expanded LEP website features translations of more than 100 brochures, fact sheets, forms, model leases, and other documents into 16 languages. The translated documents are available on HUD's website: www.hud.gov/fairhousing.

HUD also launched a new website to allow individuals to comment of an unprecedented national study that will examine housing discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Comments received in town hall meetings, and those gathered from this new website, will inform HUD on the best ways to test for housing discrimination targeted against lesbian, gay, bi-sexual or transgender individuals and couples.

04/02/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-066.cfm,HUD Announces Improvements to Neighborhood Stabilization Program,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced changes to its Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP), which helps communities acquire, rehabilitate and re-sell foreclosed and abandoned properties more quickly and help prevent further decline in hard-hit neighborhoods. Specifically, HUD will change how it defines foreclosed and abandoned to include properties in mortgage default and uninhabitable homes with lingering code violations. These expanded definitions, effective immediately, will increase the reach of NSP by allowing more properties to qualify, remove existing barriers caused by market conditions, and help state and local grantees to meet a Congressional requirement that they obligate all of their NSP1 funding by September of this year.
""The original NSP rules this Administration inherited through language from the 2008 legislation limited the impact of the Neighborhood Stabilization Program and we've heard that clearly from our partners on the ground,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""The rules needed to be more flexible so our local partners can put taxpayer dollars to work quickly to stabilize neighborhoods hard-hit by foreclosure. It is my goal to make HUD the kind of federal partner that listens and responds to the needs of communities, so that we can work together to rebuild our neighborhoods and our economy.""
HUD Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development Mercedes Márquez added, ""It became clear to us that the Neighborhood Stabilization Program as originally designed was too restrictive and limited the ability of our local partners to put this funding to work quickly. We need to be more flexible so our local partners can respond to market conditions and reverse the effects of foreclosure in these neighborhoods as quickly as possible.""
Redefining ""foreclosed""
HUD previously defined the term foreclosed to apply only to properties where the foreclosure process was completed. Local communities suggested this narrow definition was not a good fit for market conditions since many properties were lingering in the foreclosure process and beyond the reach of NSP. The original definition limited a grantee's ability to intervene strategically when a lender initiates but does not complete foreclosure, or where a default is allowed to linger. In addition, many lenders are transferring properties to aggregators or loan servicers, which then arrange for final disposition. In some of these cases, the previous policy did not consider the properties to retain their foreclosed status after title is transferred to the aggregator or servicer.
Properties will now be eligible for NSP assistance if any of the following conditions apply: The property is at least 60 days delinquent on its mortgage and the owner has been notified; or the property owner is 90 days or more delinquent on tax payments; or under state or local law, foreclosure proceedings have been initiated or completed; or foreclosure proceedings have been completed and title has been transferred to an intermediary aggregator or servicer that is not an NSP grantee, subrecipient, developer, or end user.
Redefining ""abandoned""
When the NSP program was originally designed following passage of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, the term abandoned was defined as a property that had been foreclosed upon and was vacant for at least 90 days. This definition effectively excludes properties abandoned by owners but where tenants are still in place thereby precluding local communities from assisting the properties with NSP funding or protecting the tenants' occupancy. HUD determined this limitation was a substantial barrier to the preservation of existing affordable housing.
To address this limitation, HUD is expanding the definition of an abandoned property to include homes where no mortgage or tax payments have been made by the property owner for at least 90 days or a code enforcement inspection has determined that the property is not habitable and the owner has taken no corrective actions within 90 days of notification of the deficiencies."
04/02/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-068.cfm,HUD and CPSC Issue Guidance on Repairing Homes with Problem Drywall,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) today issued interim remediation guidance to help homeowners struggling to rid their properties of problem drywall linked to corrosion of metal in their homes such as electrical components.
Earlier this year, HUD and CPSC issued a protocol (www.cpsc.gov/info/drywall/hud10020.html) to help identify problem drywall in the home. Today's interim remediation guidance is being released in recognition that many homeowners want to begin remediating their homes and offers a next step to homeowners whose homes have been determined to have problem drywall.
""This guidance, based on the CPSC's ongoing scientific research, is critical to ensuring that homeowners and contractors have confidence that they are making the appropriate repairs to rid their homes of problem drywall,"" said Jon Gant, Director of HUD's Office of Healthy Homes and Lead Hazard Control. ""The remediation guidance issued today is the latest step in an ongoing process that the Intergovernmental Task Force on Problem Drywall has undertaken to address this problem directly. We will continue to work with our Congressional, State and local partners as they seek policy solutions based on our guidance and the CPSC's scientific findings.""
Based on scientific study of the problem to date, HUD and CPSC recommend consumers remove all possible problem drywall from their homes, and replace electrical components and wiring, gas service piping, fire suppression sprinkler systems, smoke alarms and carbon monoxide alarms. Taking these steps should help eliminate both the source of the problem drywall and corrosion-damaged components that might cause a safety problem in the home. To view a full text of the remediation guidance, visit the federal Drywall Information Center website (www.drywallresponse.gov/).
""Our investigations now show a clear path forward,"" said CPSC Chairman Inez Tenenbaum. ""We have shared with affected families that hydrogen sulfide is causing the corrosion. Based on the scientific work to date, removing the problem drywall is the best solution currently available to homeowners. Our scientific investigation now provides a strong foundation for Congress as they consider their policy options and explore relief for affected homeowners.""
This interim remediation protocol is being released before all ongoing scientific studies on problem drywall are completed so that homeowners can begin remediating their homes. CPSC will continue to release its scientific studies as they are completed.
Completed studies show a connection between certain Chinese drywall and corrosion in homes. CPSC is continuing to look at long term health and safety implications.
CPSC is releasing a staff report on preliminary data from a study by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) that measured chemical emissions from samples of drywall obtained as part of the federal investigation for CPSC.
The top ten reactive sulfur-emitting drywall samples were all produced in China. Certain Chinese samples had emission rates of hydrogen sulfide 100 times greater than non-Chinese drywall samples. The patterns of reactive sulfur compounds emitted from drywall samples show a clear distinction between the certain Chinese drywall samples manufactured in 2005/2006 and non-Chinese drywall samples. Some Chinese drywall samples were similar to non-Chinese samples. Finally, several Chinese samples manufactured in 2009 demonstrate a marked decrease in sulfur emissions as compared to the 2005/2006 Chinese samples.
CPSC is also releasing a study by its contractor, Environmental Health Engineering Inc., that tested whether sulfur-reducing bacteria are present in Chinese drywall. Eight out of ten drywall samples tested showed no bacterial growth including Chinese samples that emitted high levels of hydrogen sulfide in the LBNL study. One sample of Chinese drywall and one sample of U.S. drywall showed very low levels of sulfur-reducing bacterial growth.
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) warns consumers to exercise caution in hiring contractors who claim to be experts in testing for and removing problem drywall. In a December 2009 Consumer Alert (www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/alerts/alt164.pdf), the FTC recommends that homeowners confirm a contractor's references, qualifications and background before agreeing to hire them.
Also in December, HUD announced to cities, counties and states that the funds they receive from HUD's Community Development Block Grant program may be a resource to help local communities combat the problem drywall. These Block Grant funds are given to communities which decide how to spend them, within the requirements of the law that set up the grant program. Homeowners should contact their city or county to see if they have programs that can help.
In addition, HUD has encouraged its FHA mortgage lenders nationwide to consider extending temporary relief to allow families experiencing problems paying their mortgages because of problem drywall, to allow the homeowner time to repair their homes. Families with FHA-insured loans should contact their mortgage lenders directly. HUD also is encouraging non-FHA lenders to give affected families the same consideration.
To date, the Intergovernmental Task Force on Problem Drywall, which includes CPSC, HUD, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), has released the following information on problem drywall:
August 2009 - Testing conducted by federal and state agency radiation laboratories, which found no radiation safety risk to families in homes built with drywall. October 2009 - CPSC investigated every 2009 import with a possible connection to imported Chinese drywall and confirmed that no new gypsum drywall was imported from the beginning of 2009. CPSC staff set up mechanisms to detect any possible future imports and has continued to investigate any and all suspected drywall imports. CPSC sent notices to the warehouses where any remaining Chinese drywall is stored informing them of CPSC's ongoing investigation and informing them that the warehouses should notify CPSC if they sell, transport, or dispose of any drywall from their inventory. October 2009 - Initial results on three studies of Chinese and non-Chinese drywall: Elemental and chemical tests on drywall found the presence of elemental sulfur in Chinese drywall but not in non-Chinese drywall. The tests also showed higher concentrations of strontium in Chinese drywall than in non-Chinese drywall. Chamber studies showed that Chinese drywall emits volatile sulfur compounds at a higher rate than U.S. made drywall. The study found that sulfur gases were either not present or were present in only limited or occasional concentrations inside the homes, and only when outdoor levels of sulfur compounds in the air were elevated. November 2009 - Results of CPSC's 51-home study which shows a strong association between homes with problem drywall, the levels of hydrogen sulfide in those homes and corrosion of metals in those homes. In addition, CPSC's General Counsel provided guidance to Congress and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on the possible applicability of the casualty loss provision in the Internal Revenue Code for affected homeowners. January 2010 - Interim Identification Protocol, prepared by HUD and CPSC, to help homeowners identify if they have problem drywall. April 2010 - Interim Remediation Protocol, prepared by HUD and CPSC, CPSC staff report on drywall emissions by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and EHE bacteria study.

04/05/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-069.cfm,HUD Secretary Announces Disaster Assistance for New Jersey Storm Victims,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan today announced HUD will speed federal disaster assistance to 12 counties in New Jersey and provide support to homeowners and low-income renters forced from their homes following last month's severe storms and flooding.
Last week, President Obama issued a disaster declaration for Atlantic, Bergen, Cape May, Essex, Gloucester, Mercer, Middlesex, Monmouth, Morris, Passaic, Somerset, and Union Counties. The President's declaration allows HUD to offer foreclosure relief and other assistance to certain families living in these counties.
""Families who may have been forced from their homes need to know that help is available to begin the rebuilding process,"" said Donovan. ""Whether it's foreclosure relief for FHA-insured families or helping these counties to recover, HUD stands ready to help in any way we can.""
HUD is:
Offering the State of New Jersey the ability to re-allocate existing federal resources toward disaster relief - HUD's Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and HOME programs give the State the flexibility to redirect millions of dollars to address critical needs, including housing and services for flood victims. HUD is currently contacting State and local officials to explore streamlining the Department's CDBG and HOME programs in order to expedite the repair and replacement of damaged housing; Granting immediate foreclosure relief - HUD granted a 90-day moratorium on foreclosures and forbearance on foreclosures of Federal Housing Administration (FHA)-insured home mortgages; Making mortgage insurance available - HUD's Section 203(h) program provides FHA insurance to disaster victims who have lost their homes and are facing the daunting task of rebuilding or buying another home. Borrowers from participating FHA-approved lenders are eligible for 100 percent financing, including closing costs; Making insurance available for both mortgages and home rehabilitation - HUD's Section 203(k) loan program enables those who have lost their homes to finance the purchase or refinance of a house along with its repair through a single mortgage. It also allows homeowners who have damaged houses to finance the rehabilitation of their existing single-family home; and Offering Section 108 loan guarantee assistance - HUD will offer state and local governments federally guaranteed loans for housing rehabilitation, economic development and repair of public infrastructure.

04/05/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-070.cfm,New FHA Rules Strengthen Risk Management,"WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) today announced new regulations to further reduce and better manage counterparty risks to its insurance funds as it continues to play a critical role in today's housing market. FHA will issue regulations to increase the net worth requirements of FHA-approved lenders, strengthen lender approval criteria, and make lenders liable for the oversight of mortgage brokers.
""These changes support quality mortgage lenders while excluding organizations that are ill-equipped to handle the risk associated with market variations,"" said FHA Commissioner David H. Stevens. ""That is particularly important now when a robust, competitive mortgage finance market is a crucial element in rebuilding the American economy. Lenders bear the overall risk of FHA-endorsed loans, therefore it makes sense for them to approve their counterparties and have sufficient capital to operate.""
The final rule permits FHA to more effectively focus its resources on lenders that pose the greatest potential threat to its insurance funds and to ensure that lenders possess the resources appropriate for the financial services they deliver. FHA solicited public comments on this new regulation and considered those comments in the development of the final rule.
On September 18th 2009 Stevens announced a set of credit policy changes that enhanced FHA's risk management function, including the hiring of a Chief Risk Officer for the first time in the agency's 75-year history. In addition, Stevens announced his intent to propose new regulations to further strengthen FHA's risk management. The final rule, to be published in the next few days, makes good on that promise and will:
Strengthen the Capacity of FHA-Approved Lenders - Since 1993, FHA has required approved lenders to have a net worth of at least $250,000. To ensure that FHA lenders are sufficiently capitalized to meet potential need, effective immediately, all new lender applicants for FHA programs must now possess a minimum net worth of $1 million. Provide Sufficient Time for Current FHA Lenders to Increase Net Worth - Effective one year following the enactment of this rule: Current FHA approved lenders - with the exception of small businesses - must possess a minimum net worth of $1 million; Current FHA approved small business lenders must possess a minimum net worth of $500,000.

Current FHA approved lenders - with the exception of small businesses - must possess a minimum net worth of $1 million; Current FHA approved small business lenders must possess a minimum net worth of $500,000.
• Current FHA approved lenders - with the exception of small businesses - must possess a minimum net worth of $1 million;
• Current FHA approved small business lenders must possess a minimum net worth of $500,000.
Effective three years following the enactment of this provision:
Approved lenders and applicants to FHA single-family programs must have a net worth of $1 million plus 1% of total loan volume in excess of $25 million. Approved lenders and applicants to FHA multifamily programs must have a minimum net worth of $1 million. Multifamily lenders that also engage in mortgage servicing must have an additional 1% of total volume in excess of $25 million. Multifamily lenders that do not perform mortgage servicing must have an additional 0.5% of total loan volume in excess of $25 million. Streamline Lender Approval - FHA-approved lenders currently assume liability for all the loans they originate and/or underwrite. While mortgage brokers will continue to be able to originate FHA-insured loans through their relationships with approved lenders, they will no longer receive independent FHA eligibility approval. These changes align FHA with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and have potential to increase the number of mortgage brokers eligible to originate FHA-insured loans while providing for more effective oversight of brokers by FHA-approved lenders. Mortgage brokers or other third-party originators, already approved by FHA, will be authorized to continue to originate FHA-insured loans through the end of the calendar year without sponsorship of an FHA-approved lender. Commencing January 1, 2011, however, the origination authority will end.

04/06/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-071.cfm,HUD Charges Seattle-Area Apartment Complex with Housing Discrimination,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today announced that it has charged a King County, Washington, landlord with violating the Fair Housing Act. HUD contends that Summerhill Place LLC, the owners of Summerhill Apartments in Renton, WA, its management company GRAN Inc., and on-site manager Rita Lovejoy, engaged in a pattern of adverse treatment of African Americans, Hispanics, Asian Americans, and families with children, in violation of the Fair Housing Act. The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing discrimination based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, and disability.
""No one should be denied a place to live based on where they're born, whether they have children, or whether they speak English,"" said HUD Deputy Secretary Ron Sims. ""To discriminate against any person is to discriminate against all people.""
John Trasviña, Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, added: ""The discriminatory treatment of African Americans, Hispanics, Asian Americans and families with children we found was both rampant and deplorable. Housing discrimination is illegal and unacceptable and HUD works to eliminate it.""
HUD's charge of discrimination alleges that Lovejoy treated testers who posed as prospective tenants differently based on race, color, national origin and familial status. Specifically, HUD charges that Lovejoy, among other things, offered a higher rent to African-American and Hispanic testers than a white tester for the same apartment, gave earlier availability dates and offered apartments with newer amenities to white testers as compared to African-American testers, asked Hispanic applicants if they illegally purchased social security cards, and made numerous discriminatory statements to non-white testers, including telling the African-American tester that she would not tolerate loud parties or ""weed smoking"" and that he was ""one of the good ones because you wear your pants up on your buttocks.""
HUD's investigation also found evidence that Lovejoy instructed her staff to show minority applicants apartments with less desirable amenities, such as worn carpet and older appliances, steered minority applicants away from the building in which she lived, and banned her assistant manager from speaking Spanish to Hispanic applicants, saying, ""We speak English here."" Lovejoy also allegedly told an Asian American tenant to ""go back to India if you can't use the appliances properly."" To another Asian American tenant, Lovejoy allegedly said, ""For God's sake, you come from a country with no running water and cook over an open flame.""
Also, according to the charge, testers were told that children could not play or ride their bicycles on the grounds of the complex and would instead need to go to a nearby park. The tests were completed by the Fair Housing Center of Washington at the request of King County's Office of Civil Rights.
The HUD charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to aggrieved persons for the damages caused them by the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief to deter further discrimination, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose fines in order to vindicate the public interest. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages to aggrieved persons.
FHEO and its partners in the Fair Housing Assistance Program investigate more than 10,000 housing discrimination complaints annually. People who believe they are the victims of housing discrimination should contact HUD at 1-800-669-9777 (voice), 800-927-9275 (TTY)."

Vermont will use its grant to support a local community-based affordable housing developer to create these new homes which will feature a sustainable site design, water-conserving fixtures, energy-efficient appliances/lighting, and environmentally friendly building materials.
The funding announced today is awarded through HUD's HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME), the nation's largest block grant program to support the production of affordable housing.
""This grant will help to create a new generation of housing that will offer residents more than just an affordable home,"" said Mercedes Márquez, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development. ""Working with our partners at the local level, our goal is to produce more, smarter, and certainly greener affordable housing for future generations of families.""
The State of Vermont, through the Vermont Housing Conservation Board (VHCB), will use its grant award to fund a local Community Housing Development Organization (CHDO) to construct ENERGY STAR-qualified affordable housing. Upon completion, all assisted units will be certified by an independent HOME Energy Rater (HER) as meeting the ENERGY STAR criteria. VHCB will ensure that its CHDO uses a sustainable site design; installs water conserving fixtures, energy-efficient appliances and lighting; uses a renewable energy source; uses environmentally beneficial materials and practices; implements a construction waste-management plan; uses low VOC paints and sealants and low-emitting formaldehyde composite wood; uses mold prevention techniques; and gives residents an instruction manual that provides information on how to maintain the Green features of their homes."
04/07/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-076.cfm,"HHS, HUD Partner to Allow Rental Assistance to Support Independent Living for Non-Elderly Persons with Disabilities","WASHINGTON - Thousands of Americans with disabilities will have housing assistance specifically targeted to meet their needs, Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Kathleen Sebelius and Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Shaun Donovan announced today. To read the full funding announcement, visit HUD's Web site.
As part of President Obama's Year of Community Living initiative, HHS and HUD collaborated to provide housing support for non-elderly persons with disabilities to live productive independent lives in their communities rather than in institutional settings.
HUD is offering approximately $40 million to public housing authorities across the country to fund approximately 5,300 Housing Choice Vouchers for non-elderly persons with disabilities, allowing them to live independently. HHS will use its network of state Medicaid agencies and local human service organizations to link eligible individuals and their families to local housing agencies who will administer voucher distribution.
""This number of vouchers to this community is a major milestone for HUD,"" said Donovan. ""I am pleased that two federal agencies have combined efforts to give these individuals the independence they so desperately want and deserve.""
""This commitment by HHS and HUD to directly link housing support to these individuals will be of immeasurable value not only to them, but to the communities in which they will be living,"" said Sebelius. ""Individuals with disabilities have so much to contribute to the quality of life in our communities when given the freedom and opportunity to do so.""
Of the 5,300 vouchers set aside as part of this program, up to 1,000 will be specifically targeted for non-elderly individuals with disabilities currently living in institutions but who could move into the community with assistance (Category II). The remaining 4,300 (Category I) can be used for this purpose also, but are targeted for use by non-elderly individuals with disabilities and their families in the community to allow them to access affordable housing that adequately meets their needs.
In addition, HUD is encouraging housing authorities to establish a selection preference to make some or all of their Category I allocation available to individuals with disabilities and their families who, without housing assistance, are at risk of institutionalization. Housing authorities have 90 days to submit their applications to HUD. HUD expects to have funding awards ready late fall 2010.
""Many of these individuals are low-income and can not afford market rates for housing. For a number of Americans, these vouchers, along with Medicaid home and community-based services, are essential supports that make the President's vision for community living possible,"" Sebelius noted.
The vouchers will augment work already being done by the Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services (CMS) through its Medicaid Money Follows the Person (MFP) grant program. Originally set to expire next year, the ""Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010"" extended the MFP program through 2016 with an additional appropriation of over $2 billion. The Act also cut to three months, from the previous six months, the amount of time a person must be in an institution to qualify for help making the transition to community life.
Now in its third year, the MFP program has made it possible for almost 6,000 people to live more independent lives by providing necessary supports and services in the community. Some 29 states and the District of Columbia have MFP programs.
The Year of Community Living is an outgrowth of a 1999 Supreme Court decision in Olmstead v. L.C., in which the court ruled that under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) unnecessarily institutionalizing a person with a disability who, with proper support, can live in the community can amount to discrimination. In its ruling, the Court said that institutionalization severely limits the person's ability to interact with family and friends, to work and to make a life for him or herself.
As a result of the Olmstead ruling, HHS issued guidance to states on how to make their Medicaid programs more responsive to people living with disabilities who wish to reside in the least restrictive setting. Today's announcement is yet another step in HHS's 10-year effort to achieve that goal.

FHA will begin accepting electronic signatures on third party documents originated and signed outside of the lender's control, such as real estate contracts. A Mortgagee Letter detailing FHA's new streamlined process is posted on the HUD website.

The FHA expects lenders to employ the same level of care and due diligence with electronically signed documents as for paper documents with ""wet"" or ink signatures. Lenders are reminded that the electronic signature and date should be clearly visible in the document; and that electronic documents will be subject to the same document retention requirements as paper documents.
This policy is in accordance with Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (ESIGN) and the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA), as applicable. It is effective immediately for FHA forward mortgages as well as Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECM) (reverse mortgages)."

04/14/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-078.cfm,Obama Administration Seeks Public Input on Reform of the Housing Finance System,"WASHINGTON - The Obama Administration today released questions for public comment on the future of the housing finance system, including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the overall role of the federal government in housing policy. The questions have been designed to generate input from a wide variety of constituents, including market participants, industry groups, academic experts, and consumer and community organizations. The questions will also be published in a Federal Register notice requesting public comments, and information on the process for submitting comments will be included in that notice.
""A well-functioning housing finance system is critical to the long term stability of the housing market,"" said Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner. ""Hearing from a wide variety of perspectives as we embark on this process is an important part of establishing a more stable and sound housing finance system for the American people.""
""This open process will help shape the future of our housing finance system,"" said U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Shaun Donovan ""The Obama administration is committed to engaging the public as we consider proposals for reforming the housing finance system in the context of our broader housing policy goals, and the best steps to get from where we are today to a stronger housing finance system.""
The Obama Administration will seek input in two ways. First, the public will have the opportunity to submit written responses to the questions published in the Federal Register online at Regulations.gov (www.regulations.gov/search/Regs/home.html#documentDetail?R=0900006480add0fb%20). Second, the Administration intends to hold a series of public forums across the country on housing finance reform. Together these opportunities for input will give the public the chance to deepen the federal government's understanding of the issues and to shape the policy response going forward.
This effort is both in keeping with this Administration's commitment to openness and transparency and the President's Open Government Initiative. This initiative represents a major change in the way federal agencies interact with the public by making agency operations and data more transparent and creating new ways for citizens to have an active voice in their government.

04/15/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-080.cfm,HUD Charges Philadelphia-Area Landlords with Discriminating Against Adoptive Mom,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced today that it is charging the owners of several apartment buildings in suburban Philadelphia with discriminating against families with children. HUD charges Charles and Patricia Trucksess with illegally terminating the lease of a single mother because she adopted an 11-year old child. In addition, the Department alleges that the landlords made discriminatory statements indicating that they did not rent to families with children and that they discouraged other families from applying for available rental units by understating the number of bedrooms.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing discrimination on the basis of family status.
""Adoptive families deserve the same respect and enjoy the same rights as all families in our society,"" stated John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing Equal Opportunity. ""HUD works vigorously to enforce legal protection for families with children.""
According to HUD's charge, when a single woman viewed an apartment owned by Charles and Patricia Trucksess and mentioned that she intended to adopt a child, Ms. Trucksess told her that she had never before rented to a family with children. After the woman moved into the unit, and later adopted her son, the owners notified her that they were terminating her lease. The family was forced to move to a new town, depriving the eleven-year-old boy of his school, friends, and the aunts that he visited regularly. The charge further alleges that Ms. Trucksess had previously advertised the three-bedroom apartment as having two-bedrooms to avoid inquiries from families with children.
The HUD charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to the family for its losses and order injunctive relief and other equitable relief to deter further discrimination. In addition, the judge may impose fines in order to vindicate the public interest and award attorney fees. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages to aggrieved persons.
FHEO and its partners in the Fair Housing Assistance Program investigate more than 10,000 housing discrimination complaints annually. People who believe they are victims of housing discrimination should contact HUD at 1-800-669-9777 (voice), 800-927-9275 (TTY)."
04/16/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-081.cfm,HUD Secretary Announces Nearly $24 Million to the New York City Housing Authority to Protect Rental Assistance Vouchers,"NEW YORK - U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan announced today that the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) is among nearly 600 public housing agencies that will receive additional funding to support families currently participating in HUD's Housing Choice Voucher Program. NYCHA will receive nearly $24 million that will allow the agency to continue supporting approximately 2,500 families.
""This added funding will help NYCHA and housing agencies across the country,"" said Donovan at the Minister's Luncheon for the National Action Network 2010 Convention today. ""This additional funding will help NYCHA continue to provide affordable housing for New Yorkers in need.""
The funding announced today is part of a $150 million set-aside from HUD's 2010 budget that will give public housing agencies additional funding that will help them support existing vouchers. Last February HUD issued a notice informing public housing agencies that they could apply for this funding under the following four categories:
Category (1): to adjust the allocations for agencies that experienced a significant increase in renewal costs of rental assistance resulting from unforeseen circumstances or from families moving to higher cost areas
Category (2): for adjustment for agencies with voucher leasing rates at the end of 2009 that exceed the average leasing for federal fiscal year 2009 12-month period used to establish the allocation;
Category (3): for adjustments for the costs associated with Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (VASH) vouchers; and
Category (4): for vouchers that were not in use during the Federal fiscal year 12- month period in order to be available to meet a commitment for project-based voucher assistance.
HUD reviewed approximately 1,000 submissions from agencies across the U.S. and awarded funding based on HUD's categories. Housing agencies that applied for funding will receive notifications of application status today. The Housing Choice Voucher Program is HUD's largest rental assistance program, with an $18,184,200,000 budget for 2010. The program supports approximately 2.1 million families through rental assistance payments that make housing more affordable."
04/20/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-082.cfm,National Campaign Launches to Protect Children and Families from Lead Poisoning,"NEW YORK, NY, April 20, 2010 - According to a national online survey released today by the Ad Council, only a third of parents in the United States are very concerned that lead poses a health risk to their children. However, lead poisoning affects more than one million children in the United States. If not detected early, children with high levels of lead in their bodies can suffer from damage to the brain and nervous system, behavior and learning problems (such as hyperactivity), slowed growth, hearing problems and aggressive behavior.
In an effort to raise awareness of the consequences of lead poisoning among parents and pregnant women who live in homes built before 1978, the Coalition to End Childhood Lead Poisoning, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) are joining the Ad Council today to launch a national multimedia public service advertising (PSA) campaign.
""Lead poisoning is a costly, tragic and irreversible environmental disease that robs children of their ability to reach their full potential - yet it is entirely preventable,"" said Ruth Ann Norton, Executive Director of the Coalition to End Childhood Lead Poisoning. ""That is why we teamed with our partners at the EPA, HUD and the Ad Council to launch this national lead poisoning prevention and awareness campaign. Together, we can make lead history.""
The most common pathway for lead poisoning is caused by deteriorating lead-based paint (on older windows, doors and trim, or walls) or through improper renovation, repair and painting activities that cause paint to chip, peel, or flake. Children are frequently poisoned by ingesting lead dust that has accumulated on their hands, fingers, toys, or clothing from lead hazard sources like floors and windowsills.
""Dust from paint containing lead is especially toxic to young children,"" said Steve Owens, EPA Assistant Administrator for Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances. ""Parents can protect their children from exposure to toxic lead paint dust by hiring a lead-safe trained contractor if they live in an older home and plan to renovate or repair.""
The new PSA campaign primarily aims to reach parents and caregivers of children age six and under, and pregnant women, who are at the greatest risk for lead poisoning. The objective is to educate parents about the dangers of lead poisoning so they can take immediate action to safeguard their children.
""To grow up healthy, children need to live in healthy homes, and getting homes tested for lead is an essential part of that process,"" said Ron Sims, HUD Deputy Secretary. ""There are approximately 38 million U.S. homes that still contain lead-based paint, so it's important to know the age of your home and get it tested if it was built before 1978.""
The Ad Council's national survey released today found that when parents were asked what they were concerned about only less than ten percent mentioned that lead poses a risk to their children's health. The majority of respondents rated cleaners and solvents, electrical outlets and prescription medicines as the home hazards they are most concerned about, while lead poisoning ranked second to last. Furthermore, among those respondents who used contractors to do renovations, only 38 percent were confident that they used a lead-safe contractor.
""Our research revealed that childhood lead poisoning is not a top concern among parents,"" said Peggy Conlon, president and CEO of the Ad Council. ""Our partnership with the Coalition to End Childhood Lead Poisoning, EPA, and HUD will educate parents about the dangers and empower them to take simple steps to protect their children from lead poisoning.""
Created pro bono by New York-based ad agency Merkley+Partners, the campaign includes television, radio, print, outdoor and Web advertising, which is available in English and Spanish.
""Merkley+Partners is proud to play a role in bringing awareness to the issue of lead poisoning. We believe the campaign is arresting, conveys a sense of urgency and will motivate parents and caregivers to act quickly to ensure their young children are safe,"" said Diane Hernandez, Group Account Director of Merkley+Partners.
The PSAs direct parents to visit a new comprehensive web site, www.leadfreekids.org or call a toll-free number (1-800-424-LEAD), to learn more about where lead can be found in your home, how to protect your children from exposure to lead and to know what to do if you or a member of your family is exposed to lead. The site, which is also available in Spanish at www.leadfreekids.org/espanol, encourages parents and other adults to download free toolkits in an effort to help eliminate childhood lead poisoning.
The new PSAs are being distributed to more than 33,000 media outlets nationwide this week. Per the Ad Council model, the PSAs will run and air in advertising time and space that is donated by the media.
The online survey was commissioned by the Ad Council and the Coalition to End Childhood Lead Poisoning and conducted in partnership with Lightspeed Research from April 2 to April 12, 2010. The sample consisted of 701 adults 18+ who are parents of children 0-6 or currently pregnant and live in homes built before 1980. There was also an oversample of approximately 469 parents in the ten markets where lead poisoning prevalence is the highest: New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, Detroit, Baltimore, Washington DC, Milwaukee, Atlanta and Portland.

04/20/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-083.cfm,HUD Charges Miami Housing Corporation With Discriminating Against Disabled Veteran,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today announced that it is charging the Urban League Housing Corporation of Greater Miami, Inc., its president, and a management company with violating the Fair Housing Act by refusing to make one of its units accessible for a disabled veteran. HUD brings the charge on behalf of a 71 year-old double amputee veteran, who uses a wheelchair for mobility. In addition, the Corporation allegedly refused to transfer the veteran to an accessible unit and threatened to evict him after he sought assistance from the Miami-Dade County Commissioner's office.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to refuse to grant persons with disabilities reasonable accommodations, such as changes to rules, policies or practices that allow them to fully enjoy their home. The Fair Housing Act also prohibits coercing, intimidating, threatening, or interfering with a person for having exercised their fair housing rights.
""Veterans deserve our thanks and respect whether their service to the nation was this year or fifty years ago,"" said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Moreover, landlords have a legal obligation to grant people with disabilities reasonable accommodations. HUD is committed to ensuring that they meet these fair housing responsibilities.""
According to HUD's charge, the veteran's social worker made several requests to the Urban League Housing Corp. to install accessible features, including wider doorways, or to transfer him to an accessible unit, but was refused. Shortly thereafter, the tenant contacted the Miami-Dade County Commissioner's Office for assistance. After a staff person from the Commissioner's office visited the property, the veteran was transferred to another unit, that was not accessible. When the veteran moved back into his original unit six months later, the unit had still not been made accessible and its stove had been removed.
The HUD charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to the complainant for the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief to deter further discrimination, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose fines in order to vindicate the public interest. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages to the aggrieved person.
FHEO and its partners in the Fair Housing Assistance Program investigate more than 10,000 housing discrimination complaints annually. People who believe they are the victims of housing discrimination should contact HUD at 1-800-669-9777 (voice), 800-927-9275 (TTY)."

The Green Retrofit Program is designed to create thousands of green jobs across the country as workers retrofit older federally assisted multi-family apartment developments with the next generation of energy efficient and green building technologies. Grants and loans provided through this program help private landlords and property management companies to cut heating and air conditioning costs by installing more efficient heating and cooling systems and to reduce water use by replacing faucets and toilets. These Recovery Act funds also produce other environmental benefits by encouraging the use of recycled building materials, reflective roofing, and non-toxic products to reduce potentially harmful 'off-gassing' of harmful fumes. Funds are awarded to owners of HUD-assisted housing projects and can be used for a wide range of retrofit activities, ranging from windows/doors to solar panels and geothermal installation.
The Recovery Act includes $13.61 billion for projects and programs administered by HUD, nearly 75 percent of which was allocated to state and local recipients only eight days after President Obama signed the Act into law. The remaining 25 percent is being awarded through competitive grant programs, including the Green Retrofit Program. To date, 98 percent of HUD's Recovery Act funds are in the hands of local communities, being used to improve housing and neighborhoods, while creating jobs. HUD is committed to implementing Recovery Act investments swiftly and effectively as they generate tens of thousands of jobs, modernize homes to make them energy efficient, and help the families and communities hardest hit by the economic crisis.
In addition, Secretary Donovan and the Department are committed to providing the highest level of transparency possible as Recovery Act funds are administered. It is vitally important that the American people are fully aware of how their tax dollars are being spent and can hold their federal leaders accountable.

""Adolfo knows the New York and New Jersey region and its economic and affordable housing challenges. The wealth of information he has gathered on his nationwide Urban Affairs listening tour will be of great use to HUD as we transform our agency to better assist the American people.""
""President Obama's bottom-up approach to addressing the nation's challenges is why I gladly accepted the challenge of being the first director of the White House Office of Urban Affairs,"" said Carrión ""Now that the foundation is poured and we are beginning to implement this strategy, I'm delighted to join my long time friend and colleague, Shaun Donovan, to fully implement this comprehensive urban development vision in my home region and across the country.""
""The federal agencies are now working in a robust collaborative process to ensure we are getting the best return on investment in economic development, smart infrastructure, and building strong neighborhoods,"" added Carrión. ""I look forward to working with the team at HUD, across all 10 regions, and with our congressional partners, city and county leaders and the private sector, to secure a better future for America's families.""
In his new position, Carrión will serve as HUD's liaison to mayors, city managers, elected representatives, state and local officials, congressional delegations, stakeholders and customers and will be responsible for overseeing the delivery of HUD programs and services to communities, and evaluate their efficiency and effectiveness. He will also serve as an advisor on intergovernmental relations to HUD secretary Shaun Donovan, bringing lessons learned and new approaches from his time at the White House to the local level, and ensuring the agency's major policy initiatives are implemented across the country in ways attuned to local needs and conditions. The New York Regional Office is one of the largest in the country in terms of population-served, programs, and portfolio. Region II encompasses New York and New Jersey, and is responsible for investments of approximately $1 billion a year.
Carrión's career began as a school teacher in the Bronx when, after becoming increasingly involved in the needs of students and their parents, he chose to pursue urban planning as a means to positively impact their total environment. He earned a Masters in urban planning from Hunter College in New York, and then worked for 3 years in the NYC Department of City Planning. After overseeing the development of a major transportation hub and land use strategy for the West Bronx, he became District Manager of his community's local planning board in 1992 and was then elected to the City Council in 1997.
After serving one term in the City Council, Carrión was elected Bronx Borough President, representing the borough's 1.4 million residents. Under Carrión's leadership, total investment in the borough increased from $361 million/year in 2002, to almost $1 billion/year in 2008. Unemployment was cut in half, due in large part to Carrion's aggressive pursuit of employment opportunities for local residents in the implementation of the largest infrastructure, residential and commercial redevelopment of the borough since the 1920's. On March 2, 2009, Carrión stepped down from the borough presidency and the presidency of the National Association of Latino Elected/Appointed Officials to join the White House.
Carrión, 49, is married to Linda Baldwin who serves as Director of the SMART Office at the US Department of Justice. He is proud father of three daughters and a son."

05/10/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-094.cfm,HUD Announces Settlements Against Two San Antonio Landlords,"SAN ANTONIO - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced settlements with two landlords for failing to warn their tenants that their homes may contain potentially dangerous lead paint. The San Antonio property owners have agreed to make 15 properties containing 33 total units lead safe. In addition to performing $84,000 in lead paint hazard remediation work, the landlords have agreed to pay $6,000 in civil penalties and $20,000 in Child Health Improvement Projects (CHIPs).
According to HUD, UC Rental Management, its president, Gary Carrera, and Paul Carter, violated the federal Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act and the Lead Disclosure Rule, by failing to inform tenants that their pre-1978 homes may contain potentially dangerous levels of lead.
""We don't like seeing violations like this, almost 14 years after the Lead Disclosure Rule was put into place; children should be protected from lead's destructive and permanent effects,"" said Jon L. Gant, Director of HUD's Office of Healthy Homes and Lead Hazard Control. ""HUD is absolutely committed to enforcing the Lead Disclosure Rule. We hope this settlement serves as a reminder to landlords and property management companies to do the right thing - follow the Rule and protect our children.""
UC Rental
UC Rental, Inc. owns and manages 14 properties containing 19 housing units in San Antonio (see attached list). Under the settlement, UC Rental will have lead-based paint inspections performed at the properties and will conduct lead-based paint hazard control work, including window replacement, abatement of all friction and impact surfaces that contain lead paint, stabilization of all other non-friction and non-impact surfaces that contain lead paint, and additional interim control work in all the units within a period of three years. In addition to the lead hazard reduction work, which is expected to cost about $68,000, UC Rental has paid a $5,000 civil penalty.
Paul Carter
Under his settlement, Mr. Carter agreed to have a lead-based paint risk assessment performed at Toltec Apartments, a 14-unit complex constructed in 1913. Mr. Carter will abate the lead-based paint hazards identified in the units, common areas, and exterior within one year and cover bare soil with an appropriate covering within three months. In addition to the hazard abatement work, estimated at $16,000, Mr. Carter will pay a $1,000 civil penalty and implement two CHIPs intended to reduce childhood lead poisoning in the San Antonio area. The CHIPs will consist of: (1) a $15,000 project with the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio, Texas/AVANCE Clinic to purchase and deploy an on-site blood lead analyzer and test kits; and (2) a $5,000 project with LeadSafe San Antonio to conduct a workshop for landlords to learn lead requirements when renting and renovating pre-1978 residential housing.
The settlements announced today represent HUD's first Lead Disclosure Rule enforcement actions in San Antonio, and were the result of intensive coordination among local health officials and federal investigators. HUD is continuing similar enforcement efforts around the nation, and so far has taken enforcement actions in which landlords have agreed to conduct lead-based paint hazard reduction in almost 186,000 apartments and to pay almost $1.3 million in civil penalties. In addition, a total of $723,750 has been paid directly to community-based projects to reduce lead poisoning, and landlords have committed to expend more than $30 million to address lead-based paint hazards in the affected units.
Background
The Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 is one of the primary federal enforcement tools to prevent lead poisoning in young children. The Lead Disclosure Rule, authorized by the Act, requires home sellers and landlords of housing built before 1978 to disclose to purchasers and tenants knowledge of lead-based paint or lead-based paint hazards using a disclosure form, signed by both parties, attached to the sales contract or lease containing the required lead warning statement, provide any available records or reports, and provide an EPA-approved ""Protect Your Family From Lead in Your Home"" pamphlet. Sellers must also provide purchasers with an opportunity to conduct a lead-based paint inspection and/or risk assessment at the purchaser's expense. Acceptable lead disclosure forms can be found at www.hud.gov/offices/lead/enforcement/disclosure.cfm and www.epa.gov/lead/pubs/leadbase.htm.
Health Effects of Lead-Based Paint
Lead exposure causes reduced IQ, learning disabilities, developmental delays, reduced height, poorer hearing, and a host of other health problems in young children. Many of these effects are thought to be irreversible. In later years, lead-poisoned children are much more likely to drop out of school, become juvenile delinquents and engage in criminal and other anti-social behavior. As reported in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers found that even at low levels, lead exposure in children can significantly impact IQ and even delay puberty in young girls.
At higher levels lead can irreversibly damage a child's kidneys and central nervous system and cause anemia, coma, convulsions and even death. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 310,000 of the nation's 20 million children under the age of six have blood lead levels high enough to impair their ability to think, concentrate and learn.
Eliminating lead-based paint hazards in pre-1978 housing is essential if childhood lead poisoning is to be eradicated. According to CDC estimates, the percentage of children with elevated blood lead levels has been cut in half since the early 1990's, although the prevalence of childhood lead poisoning in low-income, older housing remains high. HUD estimates that the number of houses with lead paint has declined from 64 million in 1990 to 38 million in 2000. About 24 million homes contain significant lead-based paint hazards with the potential to poison young children."

The funding will also link the elderly with supportive services that will allow them to age-in-place. Click here for local funding information.
""This is money well spent in these economic times,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""This funding allows our partner local housing agencies to provide families with more than just affordable housing, but also resources that will help them obtain jobs and achieve personal and career goals.""
The funding is provided through HUD's Resident Opportunities and Self Sufficiency (ROSS) - Service Coordinators program, which enables public housing agencies (PHAs) to keep or hire a ""service coordinator"" to work directly with residents to assess their needs to connect them with education, job training and placement programs and/or computer and financial literacy services available in their community to promote self-sufficiency. For the elderly or disabled, the service coordinator arranges supportive services that allow them to maintain their independent lifestyle.
The purpose of the ROSS Program is to encourage local innovative strategies that link public housing assistance with public and private resources to enable participating families to increase earned income; reduce or eliminate the need for welfare assistance; and make progress toward achieving economic independence and housing self-sufficiency.
The grants are awarded to PHAs, resident organizations or non-profit organizations acting on behalf of residents to encourage and promote self-sufficiency among residents."
05/12/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-099.cfm,HUD Secretary Donovan Announces New Direction for HUD Through Agency's Strategic Plan,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Shaun Donovan unveiled the agency's Strategic Plan, which will serve as the agency's roadmap toward accomplishing its mission to ""create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and affordable homes for all.""
""This Strategic Plan isn't just a paper exercise to produce a set of marching orders, but a real attempt to express what we want our agency, our homes and our neighborhoods to look like in the years to come,"" said Donovan during his address to all HUD staff nationwide. ""The plan sets out clear goals and defines success as we take HUD to its fiftieth anniversary in 2015.""
The Plan will guide the agency through fiscal years 2010-2015. Through the Strategic Plan's five specific goals, HUD will:
Strengthen the Housing Market to Bolster the Economy and Protect Consumers: To restore stability to the market, HUD will reduce the foreclosure rate and in partnership with the Department of the Treasury, assist 3 million homeowners who are at risk of losing their homes due to foreclosure by the end of the fiscal year 2011. HUD will also increase FHA capital reserves to above 2 percent and stabilize neighborhoods by helping communities purchase abandoned and vacant properties. Meet the Need for Quality Affordable Rental Homes: HUD will balance the support for sustainable homeownership and rental housing by directly contributing to the production of millions of new rental homes while also preserving their affordability, quality, accessibility and energy efficiency. Utilize Housing as a Platform for Improving Quality of Life: Stable housing provides an ideal platform to deliver a wide variety of services to improve education, health, economic security, and safety of our residents. Building upon HUD's recent efforts to reduce chronic homelessness, HUD will use technology and improved accessibility to data to make federally subsidized housing a catalyst for investments in education, health and job training, and leverage private capital to expand housing for the growing number of seniors and homeless Americans - and end homelessness altogether. Build Inclusive and Sustainable Communities Free From Discrimination: Many of the neighborhoods hit hardest by the economic and housing crisis are among the least sustainable - with limited access to economic opportunity, the longest commuting times, the most unhealthy homes, and the poorest quality schools. To transform neighborhoods, we will link housing to schools, jobs, and better transportation through our Choice Neighborhoods Initiative and Office of Sustainable Housing and Communities, and provide gap financing through a Catalytic Investment Fund for innovative, high-impact development projects that will create jobs in communities with longstanding development challenges. Transform the Way HUD Does Business: HUD recognizes that it cannot accomplish the goals in the Strategic Plan without changing the way the agency does business. HUD plans to work now to affect change by building capacity within the agency; improving performance management and accountability; decentralizing decision-making to empower staff; and simplifying programs, rules, and regulations.

Although details of the Plan were released today, HUD has already begun meeting President Obama's challenge for federal agencies to collaborate on all levels to deliver meaningful results to all Americans. In just sixteen months, HUD has demonstrated this commitment by, for example:
Allocating all $13.6 billion from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 to all 50 states in just eight days. In only six months, all funds from the Recovery Act were available to be spent by communities across the country to create jobs and help families facing foreclosure. Working alongside nearly 350 public housing authorities nationwide to provide temporary housing to the more than 30,000 families that were displaced from their homes by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Collaborating with our partners in the Administration to stabilize our housing markets - stabilizing home prices, rebuilding homeowners' equity and revitalizing communities overrun with foreclosures.

05/13/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-100.cfm,"HUD, FEMA Extend Disaster Housing Assistance Program in Louisiana and Texas for Gustav and Ike","WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan and Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Craig Fugate announced today a second extension to the Disaster Housing Assistance Program-Ike (DHAP-Ike), giving families who were displaced by Hurricanes Ike and Gustav more time to transition to long-term housing solutions. This extension increases the total length of the program to two years for eligible families.
This extension will give approximately 9,200 families who continue to participate in the program an additional five months, or until October 31, 2010, to transition from the program that has provided temporary rental assistance and case management to families since November 2008. The program was scheduled to end on May 27.
""HUD and FEMA have partnered once again to see families who were displaced by hurricanes to full recovery,"" said Donovan. ""DHAP has proven to be a successful federal agency partnership that will continue to assist families in future disasters.""
""Our goal is the same as the residents of Louisiana and Texas - to assist families as they transition to more permanent housing,"" said FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate. ""FEMA continues to work with HUD and state and local officials in support of the region's ongoing recovery.""
HUD and FEMA established the program through an inter-agency agreement to assist homeowners and renters who were displaced by Hurricanes Ike and Gustav with up to 17 months of temporary housing assistance and case management. To date, DHAP-Ike has aided approximately 26,300 families, with total federal investment at $253 million.
Included in President Obama's budget request to Congress, is an additional $66 million specifically directed to support disaster vouchers for families affected by Hurricanes Ike and Gustav. Families remaining in DHAP-Ike at the end of the program, who meet the eligibility requirements, will be transitioned to HUD's Housing Choice Voucher Program to receive this rental assistance, which allows families to pay no more than 30 percent of their income for rent.
DHAP-Ike provided full rental payments to participating families for the first six months. On May 1, 2009, families began paying $50 towards the rent. Each month thereafter, the tenant's portion of the rent increased by $50 until the tenant began paying the full rent or ended their participation in the program. The incremental rent payments will continue during this extension period. After May 2009, families whose housing expenses - rent and mortgage for personal residence that remained uninhabitable - exceed 30 percent of their post-disaster income, who also meet other program obligations, continued receiving DHAP-Ike assistance. DHAP-Ike subsidized eligible families' rent anywhere in the U.S.

05/14/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-101.cfm,HUD Awards $32.7 Million to Help the Elderly and People with Disabilities Continue to Live Independently At Home,"WASHINGTON - Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan today announced $32.7 million in Service Coordinator grants to provide more than 19,200 low-income frail elderly and residents with disabilities in federally supported housing with assistance to identify and receive health care, meals and other critical support services.
""The Obama Administration is helping older Americans and those with disabilities get the housing they need and the grants announced today give added assistance by helping to provide the services that will enable them to remain in their homes, living independently, connected to their communities and friends,"" said Donovan.
These grants are directed to owners of privately owned multifamily housing developments that receive money from HUD to house low-income individuals. The owners or their management companies then either hire or contract service coordinators with backgrounds in providing social services, especially to the frail elderly and people with disabilities, to assist their residents with special needs.
HUD notes that as the U.S. population ages and the number of older Americans grows, there will be an increased need for programs to help the elderly continue living independently in their homes. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, there were 35 million people age 65 years or older in the U.S. in 2000, and it estimates that by 2050 that number will climb to 80 million.
Projects in 40 states will receive the Service Coordinator grants. A state-by-state breakdown is attached to this release. Click here for a listing of individual grant recipients."
05/17/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-102.cfm,"Administration Releases April Loan Modification Report, Announces New Servicer Performance Measures","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today released April data for the Administration's Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) showing that permanent modifications for almost 300,000 homeowners - an increase of 68,000 or almost 13 percent over March. New in this month's report is information about servicer-specific conversion rates to permanent modifications and servicer performance in giving homeowners timely decisions. The data show that there is wide variation among servicers in these areas, further demonstrating the need for transparency regarding servicer performance.
""The number of homeowners receiving significant relief through a mortgage modification continues to rise,"" said Chief of Treasury's Homeownership Preservation Office (HPO) Phyllis Caldwell. ""Our focus now is on improving the homeowner experience and holding servicers accountable for their performance. Increased transparency through more robust reporting of servicer-specific data will contribute handily to those efforts.""
""As the number of homeowners receiving permanent modifications continues to increase, the Administration's comprehensive efforts are making an impact in the housing market's overall recovery,"" said FHA Commissioner and HUD Assistant Secretary for Housing David Stevens. ""Today, mortgage rates remain at historic lows, around five percent; foreclosure starts are down 27 percent from last year this time; and home prices and the pace of home sales have stabilized in recent months.""
Last week, as part of a continued effort to improve servicer performance, the Administration hosted a summit with representatives from participating mortgage servicing companies to discuss ways to move qualified homeowners into permanent modifications, improve homeowners' HAMP experience, quickly implement the Second Lien Modification Program and Home Affordable Foreclosure Alternatives, and maintain the pace of new trial modification starts. The Administration also outlined for servicers its plans to begin reporting more detailed performance measures. By July 2010, this reporting will include the eight largest servicers and will focus on servicer compliance, program execution, and homeowner experience.
Reporting will include the following:
Servicer Compliance with Program Guidelines Results of servicer-level loan-file reviews assessing whether loan files were appropriately evaluated Identification of all compliance activities performed for servicers and a summary of areas identified for future compliance focus
• Servicer Compliance with Program Guidelines Results of servicer-level loan-file reviews assessing whether loan files were appropriately evaluated Identification of all compliance activities performed for servicers and a summary of areas identified for future compliance focus

05/18/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-103.cfm,Obama Administration Supports Additional Funding to Stabilize Neighborhoods Hard-Hit by Foreclosure,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Shaun Donovan announced today that the Obama Administration will work with Congress to find ways to help state and local governments more effectively combat the ongoing effects of the housing crisis and home foreclosures through additional funding for the Department's Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) and foreclosure prevention counseling. Donovan made the announcement today at a roundtable with Washington, D.C.-based reporters sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor.
The Administration also announced plans to reallocate funds awarded through NSP1 that have not yet been committed to specific projects, in order to drive more funding to hardest hit communities. HUD has already awarded nearly $6 billion in NSP grants to help state and local governments respond to rising foreclosures and falling home values: $4 billion funded NSP1 through the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA); and, an additional $2 billion funded NSP2 through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). The initial NSP1 funds provided each state government with a ""base allocation"" of $19.6 million, without regard to varying degrees of need. Eighteen months later, the Department will recapture money from communities that have not yet committed NSP1 funding, and reallocate it to city and county governments with very high foreclosure and/or vacancy rates and their jurisdiction, based on more recent data.
Additionally, the Administration plans to work with Congress on new foreclosure counseling efforts to help homeowners facing foreclosure stay in their homes. HERA provided $150 million for housing counseling to connect homeowners with their mortgage servicer or lender to explore options that will keep them in their homes as a result of these counseling funds. Additional funds in this area would broaden the Administration's reach in its ongoing foreclosure prevention efforts.
""Through HUD's recapture process, the Administration is working to use the resources we have already received and build on the success and lessons from NSP1 and NSP2, ideally with additional funding for a third round, to really target the recovery in hard hit areas directly,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""The recapture process would provide additional resources to areas based on their foreclosure and delinquency rates, vacancy problems and unemployment. We also want to go a step further by providing funds to help homeowners avoid foreclosure.""
The Neighborhood Stabilization Program was created to address the housing crisis, create jobs, and grow local economies by providing communities with the resources to purchase and rehabilitate vacant homes. The NSP grants that HUD has awarded are helping state and local governments, as well as non-profit developers, acquire land and property; demolish or rehabilitate abandoned properties; and/or offer downpayment and closing cost assistance to low- to middle-income homebuyers. Grantees can also stabilize neighborhoods by creating ""land banks"" to assemble, temporarily manage, and dispose of foreclosed homes. So far, over 63,000 homes are projected to be impacted by NSP1, including acquisition, demolition, homebuyer assistance, and new construction, and over 17,000 units have been completed. For NSP2, applications were submitted for over $15 billion worth of projects nationwide, with only $2 billion available for funding.
""Both the reallocation of NSP1 funds and a third round through NSP3 would help to expand efforts to clear blighted properties, like those in Detroit where I visited last month,"" Donovan added. ""Detroit is demolishing 10,000 properties over three years, with the first two years funded by NSP. A third round of funding could help complete projects like the one in Detroit.""
HUD plans to explore with Congress a number of technical changes that could improve the flexibility and impact of the NSP program if a third round of funding can be secured. HUD will also work with Congress to help local grantees access more of the administrative capacity needed for effective implementation and, as part of this effort, to secure additional funds for technical assistance (TA) as well.
Local communities would design and set their own program targets, but HUD would provide options for implementation. To ensure best use of taxpayer dollars, grantees would, based on NSP1 performance, either be required to:
Work with a subgrantee - an entity that is granted the legal obligations and authority to implement NSP on behalf of the grantee; Sign a Technical Assistance agreement with HUD; or, Work in a consortium with a high capacity lead grantee.
• Work with a subgrantee - an entity that is granted the legal obligations and authority to implement NSP on behalf of the grantee;
• Sign a Technical Assistance agreement with HUD; or,
• Work in a consortium with a high capacity lead grantee.
In order to reallocate NSP1 funding, HUD would follow guidelines set forth in HERA, which says that states and units of general local government have no more than 18 months to dedicate NSP1 funds to specific projects. The Department estimates that 70% of the $3.9 billion in NSP1 funds would be obligated by the 18-month deadline this fall, in September and October 2010, for a recapture of approximately $1 billion. Following a 30 day review period, funds that grantees have not yet committed to specific projects will be reallocated either to new grantees or as additional funds for first round grantees.
""HUD is committed to helping local communities recover from the blight and vacancies that have become visual symbols of difficult economic times,"" said Donovan. ""We have much more work to do to mitigate the impacts that foreclosures have had on local communities; however, innovative collaborations between local government, housing agencies, and non-profits and creative, green-focused uses of federal funds will create jobs and put us on the path to recovery."""
05/21/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-104.cfm,"HUD Publishes Advance Guidance for Pilot Program to Revitalize Public, Other HUD-Assisted Housing and Communities","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development posted the Choice Neighborhood FY 2010 Notice of Funding Availability Pre-Notice today to give potential applicants guidance prior to the actual Choice Neighborhoods funding notice, to be published this summer. The guidance offers advance details regarding the application process to compete for funds through this pilot program.
""We want the Choice Neighborhood pilot program to build on the achievements and lessons learned under the HOPE VI program,"" said HUD Assistant Secretary for the Office of Public and Indian Housing Sandra B. Henriquez. ""To do that, we believe it is absolutely necessary to inform our partners as early as possible of the tools they will need in place to be ready when the competition begins.""
The Pre-Notice outlines the core goals of the Choice Neighborhoods Initiative that Congress approved with the passage of HUD's FY 2010 budget. The information will help entities interested in applying for funding under Choice Neighborhoods better prepare for the Notice of Funding Availability, the official federal government application to obtain funding.
""Posting guidance of this magnitude for upcoming funding availability is an unprecedented step for HUD,"" said Carol Galante, HUD Deputy Assistant Secretary for Multifamily Housing. ""We hope this early guidance is helpful and we stand ready to respond to questions for further clarifications.""
This is the pilot year of the competitive program that will award up to $65 million to public housing authorities, local governments and nonprofit organizations to extend neighborhood transformation efforts beyond the public and or assisted housing to link housing revitalization with education reform and early childhood education. One key feature in the pilot program is the requirement that any public housing or other HUD-assisted housing unit demolished under the program must be replaced with another unit unless there are valid, quantifiable reasons for exception. The program widens the traditional pool of eligible applicants by allowing for-profit developers to submit joint applications with a public entity.
The Pre-Notice introduces key program elements and activities as well as the framework of the competition HUD will use to award this year's grants. While the nearly 20-year-old HOPE VI Revitalization Program has been successful at transforming neighborhoods with distressed public housing into revitalized mixed-income communities, Choice Neighborhoods aims to use a more comprehensive approach to community development with housing transformation as its center. The program also expands targeted units to include both public and assisted housing."
05/24/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-105.cfm,"HUD Approves $292.5 Million Financing Plan to Build State-Of-The-Art Hospital in East Norriton, Pennsylvania","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today committed to insure a mortgage loan to New Regional Medical Center (NRMC) in East Norriton, Pennsylvania. The $292.5 million loan is made possible through the Federal Housing Administration's (FHA) Section 242 Hospital Mortgage Insurance Program.
The new facility is the product of a strategic partnership between Albert Einstein Healthcare Network and Montgomery Hospital Medical Center. It will include construction of a new 146-bed, state-of-the-art acute care hospital, including 96 surgical beds, a 22-bed intensive care unit, a 20-bed obstetrical unit, and an eight-bed neonatal intensive care unit. The new structure will expand local access to quality health care and is the first completely new medical center to be built in the southeastern Pennsylvania region, including the city of Philadelphia, in at least a decade, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Health.
""FHA is helping to build state-of-the-art health care facilities like this all across the country,"" said FHA Commissioner David Stevens. ""By helping to make these projects possible, FHA also contributes to the financial well-being of communities by creating jobs and helping to stimulate local economies.""
HUD estimates the New Regional Medical Center construction project will support 2,750 full-time jobs and provide an estimated economic stimulus of more than $785 million to the community. Once completed, it is estimated the project will support 450 full-time jobs and provide an annual economic benefit of more than $101 million.
""We are delighted to know that our new hospital project is backed by the faith and credit of the U.S. Government, and we are grateful to the FHA for their support,"" said Einstein President and CEO Barry Freedman. ""Einstein looks forward to the contribution we can make to the local community, both by creating and preserving jobs in a challenging economy and by providing advanced health and wellness services for area residents.""
The new facility will offer both inpatient and outpatient services including emergency medicine, cardiology, general medicine, obstetrics/gynecology, general surgery, interventional radiology/vascular/cardiology, oncology, and orthopedics. It will also begin offering services not currently available in its service area. These services include cardiac surgery, advanced electrophysiology, cardiac catheterization, and neonatal intensive care.
By insuring the mortgage loan, FHA is enabling the medical center to obtain lower cost financing that will save an estimated $74 million in interest expense over the life of the loan. Since 1968, FHA has insured 383 mortgages to hospitals throughout the nation, 42 within the past five years.
FHA's Section 242 Mortgage Insurance Program for Hospitals provides HUD-insured mortgages made by private lending institutions to finance construction or renovation of acute care hospitals including major equipment needed to operate the facility. The eligible applicants can be public, proprietary, or nonprofit hospitals certified by the responsible State agency."

The funding, provided through HUD's Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program, supports the long-term disaster recovery in the wake of Hurricanes Dolly and Ike in 2008.
In addition, HUD is encouraged that the State has resolved a fair housing dispute with local advocates who complained that an earlier disaster recovery plan would distribute HUD funding in a discriminatory manner.
""I am encouraged Texas has offered its residents a more thoughtful, fair and data-driven plan that recognizes where the greatest needs are,"" said Donovan. ""Once the public comment period for this revised program is completed, we look forward to reviewing the State's final plan so we can put these resources to work as quickly as possible.""
HUD's Assistant Secretary of Community Planning and Development Mercedes Márquez said, ""This proposed plan places significantly more emphasis on the unmet needs of East Texas. We intend to continue working closely with our partners on the State level to ensure the long-term recovery of the people and places that were most impacted by these hurricanes.""
Last year, HUD asked the State to apply a more thorough analysis of unmet housing, infrastructure, and economic development need. The revised plan (www.tdra.state.tx.us/index.php/Home/HURRICANE+RECOVERY), which is now undergoing public comment, shifts $208 million to areas with greater documented need and $152 million toward housing activities.
Texas Low Income Housing Information Service and Texas Appleseed also filed complaints with HUD alleging that the State of Texas, through its Departments of Rural Affairs and Department of Housing and Community Affairs, violated the Fair Housing Act and the Housing and Community Development Act. Specifically, the complainants allege that the State proposed to distribute federal disaster recovery funds in a manner that discriminated based on race, color or national origin. The parties have now entered into a conciliation agreement, approved by HUD, which provides for extensive relief, including requiring that funds be re-allocated to affirmatively further fair housing; that the State produce an updated Analysis of Impediments to Fair Housing (""AI"") for public comment and approval; and provide more fair housing training of sub-recipients of federal funding."
05/25/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-107.cfm,"HUD Releases 2007 ""Worst Case Housing Needs"" Report to Congress","WASHINGTON - In 2007, nearly 13 million low-income persons paid more than half their monthly income for rent, lived in severely substandard housing, or both. In a report to Congress, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development found that these ""worst case housing needs"" grew significantly between 2001 and 2007.
HUD's study, Worst Case Housing Needs 2007: A Report to Congress (www.huduser.org/portal/publications/affhsg/wc_HsgNeeds07.html), is the 12th in a series of reports designed to measure the scale of critical housing problems facing low-income American renting households. Based on data from the American Housing Survey (AHS) conducted between May and September of 2007, this report does not address much of the economic impact being felt by this population due to the current housing crisis. HUD expects that its next Worst Case Needs report will include those findings.
""Behind every number is the story of a person or a family struggling to maintain affordable housing,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""Whether these worst case needs are caused by general rental market conditions or by the lack of federal investment in affordable rental housing we saw between 2001 and 2007, the Obama Administration is not willing to turn a blind eye toward the absolute need we're seeing all across our nation. That's why we've increased our investment in affordable housing to meet the increase in worst case housing needs that developed over the past few years.""
Dr. Raphael Bostic, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research, added, ""This report makes clear that worst case housing needs is a crisis that touches families of every type, of every racial and ethnic background, and from every part of the country.""
HUD found that 5.91 million households had worst case housing needs in 2007 compared to 5.01 million in 2001. These needs are defined as renters with very low incomes (below half the median in their area) who do not receive government housing assistance and who either paid more than half their monthly incomes for rent, lived in severely substandard conditions, or both. The report makes clear that worst case housing needs cut across all regions of the country and included all racial and ethnic groups, regardless of whether they lived in cities, suburbs or rural areas. In addition, HUD concluded that large numbers of worst case needs were also found across various family types including families with children, senior citizens, and persons with disabilities.
Demographics of Worst Case Housing Needs include:
The number of households with worst case housing needs in 2007 was 5.91 million households, comprising 12.97 million individuals. This number was a slight (and statistically insignificant) decrease of 1.5 percent from the 5.99 million worst case needs in 2005. The small decrease in worst case needs from 2005 to 2007 occurred following a significant increase of 19.6 percent during the 2001-to-2005 period. The primary cause of worst case needs is severe rent burden (paying more than half of income for rent). Of the 5.91 million households with worst case housing needs, 5.48 million (93 percent) had severe rent burden as their sole problem, 190,000 households lived in severely inadequate housing, and 240,000 households had both problems. In general, worst case needs are more prevalent among extremely low-income families. A majority of households (4.33 million) had extremely low incomes (less than 30 percent of area median income), and a smaller but substantial portion (1.58 million) earned between 30-to-50 percent of their area's median income. Family Type – Worst case needs are found across different types of families. Among the 5.91 million WCN households were: 2.19 million families with children; 1.21 million elderly households; 602,000 non-elderly disabled households; and 1.91 million ""other"" households. Disabilities – In addition to the 602,000 non-elderly disabled households, there were 404,000 families with children that had an adult with disabilities present – bringing the combined total of these two types of households with disabilities and worst case housing needs to more than one million. Disabled households were found to have the highest likelihood of having WCN among the four main family types (families with children, elderly, disabled and ""other"" households). Race and Ethnicity – Worst case needs were found across racial and ethnic groups. There were 2.92 million non-Hispanic white households, 1.35 million non-Hispanic black households, and 1.23 million Hispanic households with worst case housing needs. Geography – Worst case needs were found across national regions and across central cities, suburbs and non-metropolitan areas. In the West, 40.0 percent of very low-income renters had worst case needs in 2007, while the incidence in the South was 37.4 percent and 36.2 percent in the Northeast. The Midwest had the lowest incidence, yet in this region too, more than one-third of very low-income renters, 34.3 percent, had worst case needs. Nearly equal shares of these households lived in central cities (37.7 percent), suburban areas (34.7 percent) and non-metropolitan/rural communities (32.1 percent). Working Families – During 2007, near half (46 percent) of households with children that experienced worst case needs were working the equivalent of full-time and earning at least minimum wage.

The continuing worst case needs crisis shows the need for both more affordable housing and increased family incomes. Key elements of the President's proposed Fiscal Year 2011 Budget for HUD affordable housing and economic development activities include:
Transforming HUD's rental assistance by consolidating 13 separate programs into one streamlined program to preserve the existing affordable housing stock. Investing $1 billion for the National Housing Trust Fund to support state and local affordable housing production. Building on the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to increase family incomes and job growth through key economic development. This includes a$150 million Catalytic Investment Fund to stimulate local economic innovation and $250 million for the Choice Neighborhoods Initiative to transform neighborhoods with concentrated poverty into sustainable mixed income communities.

""Today,"" said Secretary Donovan, ""we have a parallel housing system in which most families live in housing that is financed, developed and managed through mechanisms that can be integrated with the communities around them -- while the two-and-a-half million poor families served by HUD's oldest programs live in another. These families are not only required to fill out dozens of applications processed by scores of administrators simply to have a decent chance of receiving the assistance they need - even worse, they often find themselves trapped in neighborhoods of concentrated poverty because moving means giving up that assistance. That's not right.""
""This legislation not only reflects our best thinking at HUD - but perhaps more importantly our best listening,"" Donovan added, ""incorporating the lessons we've learned from Congress and other stakeholders about what it takes to build strong neighborhoods and help families make the housing choices they need.By streamlining HUD's rental assistance programs and by allowing them to link housing investments to surrounding neighborhoods, this legislation fulfills President Obama's commitment to ensuring that all families can live in sustainable, vibrant communities of opportunity and choice.""

05/26/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-108.cfm,HUD Charges Buffalo Area Real Estate Company and Broker for Discriminating Against Families with Children,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is charging an Amherst, New York real estate company and one of its brokers with discriminating against families with children in violation of the Fair Housing Act. Specifically, HUD's Charge of Discrimination alleges that RE/MAX North's broker refused to rent an apartment to a family with children and refused to show another apartment to a family looking for housing.
""HUD is serious about protecting the rights of families with children to be able to rent or buy housing in all communities,"" said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (FHEO).""While most in the housing industry get it right, HUD will vigorously enforce the law where we find discrimination.""
According to HUD's charge, a mother of five children applied to rent the four-bedroom apartment in Clarence, New York, when the broker informed her that the owner of the unit was in no ""shape to deal with . . . children"" and had decided, instead, to rent the unit to a young couple.
The applicant reported the incident to the non-profit fair housing organization Housing Opportunities Made Equal (HOME). HOME sent testers posing as housing applicants with children to see how they would be treated. One tester reported that the same broker refused to show her an apartment in Tonawanda because that owner was not happy about having children in the apartment.
The HUD Charge of Discrimination will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) unless a party to the Charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If the ALJ finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, the ALJ may award damages to the injured family and to HOME, and order injunctive relief and other equitable relief to deter further discrimination. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties in order to vindicate the public interest and award attorney fees. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages to aggrieved persons.
HUD and its partners in the Fair Housing Assistance Program investigate more than 10,000 housing discrimination complaints annually. People who believe they are the victims of housing discrimination should contact HUD at 1-800-669-9777 (voice), 800-927-9275 (TTY)."

Donald Babers to serve as HUDs Acting Southwest Regional Director for a five-state region that includes Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico and Oklahoma. Babers is currently HUD's Deputy Regional Director where he directs operations of the HUD Regional Office in Fort Worth, Texas, and the 11 HUD Field Offices within the five states that comprise the region.
We are extremely fortunate to have such an experienced hand to address the challenges in one of our busiest regions, said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. With nearly four decades of housing experience, Don knows the Agency inside and out and he is well known and respected among HUDs partners throughout the region.
In his new position, Babers will serve as HUDs liaison to state and local elected officials, congressional delegations, and other stakeholders. He will be responsible for overseeing the delivery of HUD programs and services to communities and evaluating their effectiveness.
""I am deeply honored by this privilege to serve and I am truly excited about being able to help this Administration revolutionize the delivery of HUDs services to our clients,"" said Babers. ""HUD plays a critical role in the lives of families throughout this region. I want to be a part of the visionary team that is transforming the way we do business and raising the bar.""
Babers began his federal career in June 1970 as an intern in HUDs Fort Worth office, later serving as an Equal Opportunity Specialist and fair housing director in HUDs Little Rock, Arkansas field office. For 15 years, the Fort Worth native held a number of managerial positions in HUDs Dallas field office including leading the effort to resolve a housing discrimination challenge brought against the Department. Babers role in helping to settle that case is credited for significantly expanding affordable housing opportunities for lower income public housing residents in 36 East Texas counties.
In 2002, he was appointed Deputy Regional Director of HUDs Fort Worth Regional Office and in 2006, the Secretary appointed him as Recovery Advisor/Chairman of the Board of the Housing Authority of New Orleans (HANO). Babers was given the difficult task of overseeing the Citys public housing recovery efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. During his two years in New Orleans, he oversaw every facet of HANOs redevelopment efforts designed to provide rental and homeownership housing units to displaced families. In a highly charged environment, Babers formed important partnerships among groups with disparate viewpoints and agendas by working effectively with Federal, State and City agencies, officials and legislators, private and non-profit organizations, residents and the national media.
In 2006, Babers efforts in New Orleans and his distinguished track record earned him the Presidential Rank Award for Meritorious Executive, the highest award a career federal civil servant can receive.
He received a Bachelor of Arts Degree in history and sociology from the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA), and currently resides in Fort Worth with his wife, Sheila."

For the first time since the inception of the program, applicants for FY 2009 HOPE VI Revitalization funding were encouraged to include plans in their applications to connect the redevelopment effort with early childhood education programs. The HOPE VI Program aims not only to transform the physical condition of a public housing community, but also to positively impact the lives of the residents. As one way to encourage that objective, housing authorities were given additional points in the application scoring process for demonstrating commitments and plans related to early childhood education, such as having a partnership with an institution that implements a comprehensive, high-quality, results-oriented early childhood education program that promotes best practices.
The early childhood education component encouraged through this grant round challenged housing authorities to extend neighborhood transformation efforts beyond public housing to link housing intervention with education. The Obama Administration upholds this challenge in Choice Neighborhoods, a pilot program that is currently under development Choice Neighborhoods, which Congress approved with HUD's FY 2010 budget, aims to build upon the achievements and lessons learned of HOPE VI by employing a comprehensive approach to community development centered on housing development. Choice Neighborhoods aims to transform neighborhoods of poverty into viable mixed-income neighborhoods with access to economic opportunities by revitalization of severely distressed public and assisted housing by investing and leveraging in well-functioning services, effective schools and education programs, public assets, public transportation and improved access to jobs. A pre-notice concerning Choice Neighborhoods was recently issued by the Department and is posted on the HUD website at www.hud.gov/cn.
Since 1993, HUD has awarded HOPE VI grants to public housing authorities to encourage public-private partnerships to transform severely distressed public housing into mixed-income communities that assist residents in becoming self-sufficient. The program was created in 1992 following a report by the National Commission on Severely Distressed Public Housing, which concluded that approximately 86,000 public housing units in the U.S. needed revitalization.
HOPE VI Revitalization grant funds are used for an array of activities, including: demolition of severely distressed public housing; acquisition of sites for off-site construction; capital costs of major rehabilitation; new construction and other physical improvements; costs for mobility counseling and relocation; and community and supportive service programs for residents, including those relocated as a result of revitalization efforts.
Housing authorities are competitively selected for HOPE VI grants based on many factors including the effectiveness and project readiness of their revitalization plans HUD gives recipients the flexibility to develop revitalization plans that meet their local needs. Among other criteria, grantees are also awarded funds based on the capacity of the housing authority and its development team to administer and manage completion of the revitalization effort; the severity of physical distress of the development; the ability of the housing authority to supplement the HOPE VI grant with funding from other sources, private, state or local government; the ability to provide supportive services to displaced residents; and the proposed green development and energy efficiency strategies."

As one way to encourage that objective, housing authorities were given additional points in the application scoring process for demonstrating commitments and plans related to early childhood education, such as having a partnership with an institution that implements a comprehensive, high-quality, results-oriented early childhood education program that promotes best practices.
The early childhood education component encouraged through this grant round challenged housing authorities to extend neighborhood transformation efforts beyond public housing to link housing intervention with education. The Obama Administration upholds this challenge in Choice Neighborhoods, a pilot program that is currently under development. Choice Neighborhoods, which Congress approved with HUDs FY 2010 budget, aims to build upon the achievements and lessons learned of HOPE VI by employing a comprehensive approach to community development centered on housing development. Choice Neighborhoods aims to transform neighborhoods of poverty into viable mixed-income neighborhoods with access to economic opportunities by revitalization of severely distressed public and assisted housing by investing and leveraging in well-functioning services, effective schools and education programs, public assets, public transportation and improved access to jobs. A pre-notice concerning Choice Neighborhoods was recently issued by the Department and is posted on the HUD website at www.hud.gov/cn
Since 1993, HUD has awarded HOPE VI grants to public housing authorities to encourage public-private partnerships to transform severely distressed public housing into mixed-income communities that assist residents in becoming self-sufficient. The program was created in 1992 following a report by the National Commission on Severely Distressed Public Housing, which concluded that approximately 86,000 public housing units in the U.S. needed revitalization.
HOPE VI Revitalization grant funds are used for an array of activities, including: demolition of severely distressed public housing; acquisition of sites for off-site construction; capital costs of major rehabilitation; new construction and other physical improvements; costs for mobility counseling and relocation; and community and supportive service programs for residents, including those relocated as a result of revitalization efforts.
Housing authorities are competitively selected for HOPE VI grants based on many factors including the effectiveness and project readiness of their revitalization plans. HUD gives recipients the flexibility to develop revitalization plans that meet their local needs. Among other criteria, grantees are also awarded funds based on the capacity of the housing authority and its development team to administer and manage completion of the revitalization effort; the severity of physical distress of the development; the ability of the housing authority to supplement the HOPE VI grant with funding from other sources, private, state or local government; the ability to provide supportive services to displaced residents; and the proposed green development and energy efficiency strategies."
06/03/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-117.cfm,"HUD to Provide Permanent Housing to Nearly 8,000 Homeless Veterans","WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Shaun Donovan announced today that nearly 8,000 homeless veterans will get permanent housing assistance through a HUD rental assistance program that connects homeless veterans from local Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMC) with rental assistance vouchers provided by local public housing agencies. HUD's Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing Program (HUD-VASH) will provide local public housing agencies with $58.6 million in funding specifically targeted to assist homeless veterans in their area.
For a local breakdown of the rental vouchers announced today, visit: HUD VASH.
""Though they served and sacrificed so much for our country, too many of our veterans find themselves on the streets and in homeless shelters,"" said Donovan. ""Thankfully, these vouchers will provide a more permanent solution to housing and services these veterans need.""
""Today, the Departments of Veterans Affairs (VA) and HUD are making a critical, long-term investment toward ending homelessness among veterans,"" said VA Secretary Eric K. Shinseki. ""The most effective option to providing veterans permanent shelter is HUD-VA Supportive Housing -- HUD-VASH -- the Nation's largest permanent housing initiative for Veterans. We owe every man and woman, who has worn our Nation's military uniforms, a level of courage and determination that matches theirs as we work to end veteran homelessness. HUD-VASH is immensely important and effective to reaching our goal.""
The grants announced today are part of a $75 million investment to support the needs of homeless veterans. HUD expects to announce a second round of funding for another 1,355 rental vouchers next month and an additional 400 project-based vouchers later this summer. Local public housing agencies that administer HUD's Housing Choice Voucher Program (HCV) work closely with VAMCs to manage the program. In addition to the rental assistance, VAMCs provide supportive services and case management to eligible homeless veterans.
HUD allocates the housing vouchers to local public housing agencies, which are specifically targeted to homeless veterans based on a variety of factors, including the number of reported homeless veterans and the proximity of a local VAMC with the capacity to provide case management. Local communities that receive HUD homeless assistance will work with local VAMCs to identify eligible participants. VAMC case managers will also work directly with local housing agencies that are administering the HUD-VASH program to determine income eligibility and help participants find suitable housing. Veterans participating in the HUD-VASH program rent privately owned housing and generally contribute no more than 30 percent of their income toward rent. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) offers eligible homeless veterans clinical and supportive services through its medical centers across the U.S and Puerto Rico.
This is the third year HUD is supporting the housing and service needs of homeless veterans across America through HUD-VASH with a total investment of $225 million that will sustain approximately 30,000 rental assistance vouchers."
06/03/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-118.cfm,HUD Solicits Public Comment on Referral Practices to Affiliated Businesses That May Violate RESPA,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development published a notice seeking public comment today on how it might strengthen and clarify the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA)'s prohibition against the ""required use"" of affiliated settlement service providers. HUD's Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2010/pdf/2010-13350.pdf) is requesting comments from the public that might inform any possible future revision or clarification of this prohibited practice.
It is a violation of RESPA when a consumer is required to use a particular mortgage lender, title company, or other settlement service provider that is affiliated with another business in their mortgage transaction. However, whether a consumer is ""required to use"" a particular affiliated service provider when they are offered a discount or some other incentive is less obvious.
""It is our intent to keep an open mind on how to approach this vexing question over what is, and what is not, 'required use,'"" said David Stevens, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Housing/Federal Housing Commissioner. ""Clearly, consumers are complaining that they are being presented offers they believe they can't refuse and are essentially being required to use certain affiliated service providers.""
RESPA was enacted to prevent kickbacks for referrals that increase costs of settlement services and to encourage shopping for settlement services. HUD remains committed to RESPA's goal of protecting home buyers against unnecessarily high settlement costs by addressing both incentives and penalties that limit competition and shopping for settlement services. With the notice HUD released today, the Department seeks comment from an array of sources with experience or knowledge of affiliated business arrangements in residential mortgage transactions. In addition, HUD welcomes comment on actions it might take in addition to or instead of rulemaking that would better address the improper use of affiliated business arrangements.
HUD's current definition of 'required use' reads:
""Required use means a situation in which a person must use a particular provider of a settlement service in order to have access to some distinct service or property, and the person will pay for the settlement service of the particular provider or will pay a charge attributable, in whole or in part, to the settlement service. However, the offering of a package or (combination of settlement services) or the offering of discounts or rebates to consumers for the purchase of multiple settlement services does not constitute a required use. Any package or discount must be optional to the purchaser. The discount must be a true discount below the prices that are otherwise generally available, and must not be made up by higher costs elsewhere in the settlement process.""
A number of consumer complaints concern home builders, who are in a position to refer settlement service business to their affiliated mortgage and title companies. For example, a developer or homebuilder might offer to reduce the cost of a home (by adding free construction upgrades or by discounting the home price) if the home buyer uses the developer's or builder's affiliated mortgage lender. In some circumstances, these incentives may not represent true discounts and homebuyers may ultimately pay more in total loan costs. Consumers also complain that the timing of the contract with the builder precludes them from shopping, and the affiliated lender is then able to charge higher settlement costs or interest rates that are not competitive with those of non-affiliated lenders. The complaints indicate that these incentivized referrals to affiliated lenders may be steering techniques that effectively ""require the use"" of the affiliate."
06/07/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-119.cfm,HUD Adds Important Civil Rights Protections to Its Grant Programs,"WASHINGTON - For the first time in its history, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) will require grant applicants seeking HUD funding to comply with state and local anti-discrimination laws that protect lesbian, gay, bi-sexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals. Today, HUD published a notice detailing the general requirements that will apply to all of the Department's competitively awarded grant programs for Fiscal Year 2010.
""We're using every avenue to shut the door against discrimination,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""Today, we take an important step to insist that those who seek federal funding must demonstrate that they are meeting local and state civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.""
Traditionally, HUD requires all applicants for competitive grant funding to comply with all applicable federal fair housing and civil rights requirements including those expressed in Fair Housing Act; Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Now HUD will further stipulate that applicants and their sub-recipients must comply with state or local laws proscribing housing discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. It is estimated there are approximately 20 states and the District of Columbia that have laws prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation discrimination. In addition, 12 states and the District of Columbia prohibit discrimination based on gender identity.
HUD's General Section will not consider an applicant's submission if they fail to meet minimum thresholds which will now include being able to demonstrate that they have not been charged with a systemic violation of state or local law proscribing discrimination in housing based on sexual orientation or gender identity.
Last October, HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan announced a series of measures to ensure that the agency's core housing programs are open to all, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. In addition to the notice published today, HUD intends to propose new regulations that will clarify that the term ""family"" as used to describe eligible beneficiaries of HUD's programs include otherwise eligible LGBT individuals and couples. The Department's intent to propose new regulations will clarify family status to ensure its core housing programs are available to all families, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.
The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) will also instruct its lending community that FHA-insured mortgage loans must be based on the credit-worthiness of borrowers and not on unrelated factors or characteristics such as sexual orientation or gender identity. Finally, HUD will commission the first-ever national study of discrimination against members of the LGBT community in the rental and sale of housing. The Department is currently seeking online public comment from interested parties in how it might design this new study.
In addition, HUD will provide enhanced customer services for members of the public who bring fair housing complaints to the Department's attention on the basis of LGBT status. Specifically, in places where state or local laws already prohibit LGBT-related housing discrimination, intake staff in HUD's Office of Fair Housing Equal Opportunity will ensure these complaints are directed to the appropriate state and local anti-discrimination offices. HUD intake staff also will be trained to identify any allegations over which HUD has existing authority under the Fair Housing Act, such as HIV/AIDS-related discrimination, that may be considered grounds for enforcement action based on the law's current protections (i.e., against disability discrimination)."
06/11/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-120.cfm,Four Model Affordable Housing Developments Earn Prestigious HUD Secretary Design Award,"WASHINGTON - Four affordable housing developments are the recipients of the HUD Secretary's Housing and Community Design Award (www.huduser.org/research/secaward.html) for excellence in residential housing design. The U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, in conjunction with the American Institute of Architects, selected The Paseo Senter of San Jose, California; the Congo Street Initiative of Dallas, Texas; Arbor Lofts of Lancaster, California; and the Madrona Live/Work of Seattle, Washington as models for a new generation of affordable housing.
Ed Jennings, Jr. HUD's new Southeast Regional Administrator presented the awards during the 2010 AIA National Convention and Design Exposition in Miami.
""These developments challenge the old ideas about how affordable housing can fit into the fabric of their surrounding communities,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan, himself a trained architect. ""Helping to build vibrant, sustainable communities starts at the drawing board and each of these developments proves that thoughtful design can create a lasting imprint on our neighborhoods.""
This year's HUD Secretary's Housing and Community Design Award recipients are:
Excellence in Affordable Housing Design - Paseo Senter at Coyote Creek of San Jose, California (www.aia.org/practicing/awards/AIAB083017) (Submitting Architect: David Baker Kevin Wilcock). This award recognizes Architecture that demonstrates overall excellence in terms of design that responds to both the needs and constraints of affordable housing. This project creates a ""place"" in a previously disconnected, disused section of the city. Paseo Senter's neighborhood opens onto a new main street, or paseo, that connects the arterial roadway to the area's green recreation area. The paseo - a road designed for pedestrians - bustles with activity engendered by entry stoops and retail-style social services, including a community room, library, and kin caregiver center. At its midpoint, the paseo widens into a plaza that holds the main entries to the two residential buildings, as well as to the pool area. In each building, three stories of apartments top the ""retail"" uses in a classic urban mixed-use style, and the apartments wrap the garage, maintaining an active street edge. This project has a strong affordable housing focus-with commitment from both public and private entities-incorporates mixed use, and promotes a variety of housing choices. Community-Informed Design - Congo Street Initiative of Dallas, Texas (www.aia.org/practicing/awards/AIAB083019) (Submitting Architect: Brent A. Brown). The Community-Informed Design Award recognizes design that supports physical communities as they rebuild social structures and relationships that may have been weakened by out-migration, disinvestment, and the isolation of inner-city areas. Built prior to 1910, this narrow street, with 17 single-family and duplex houses, was often referred to as the ""all-colored alley."" In 1933, the street's long-time landlord deeded properties on the north side to the residents. Many of the current residents of this community are the children, grandchildren, and even great-grandchildren of former renters. The process of restoring structural integrity to the street developed out of a desire to preserve the tight-knit sense of community that has existed on Congo Street for decades, and to respect the economic options available to the homeowners. Despite the need for repairs, residents have expressed a desire to remain in their homes and have resisted development plans that would displace them, even temporarily. The challenge was how to redevelop without relocation and without incurring steep financial burdens. Through neighborhood meetings, the residents developed a process, starting with the idea of building a new residence on the street that would serve as a temporary home for each family during the evaluation and rehabilitation of their home. The jury observes that this project demonstrates an exceptionally high level of community engagement. Creating Community Connection - Artist Housing/Arbor Lofts of Lancaster, California (www.aia.org/practicing/awards/AIAB083018) (Submitting Architect: Mark Lahmon). This award recognizes projects that incorporate housing within other community amenities for the purpose of either revitalization or planned growth. This 21-unit affordable housing development for artists is the first urban infill project to be completed since the city implemented its new Downtown Specific Plan. These new urban pioneers support the city's goal to ""revitalize and improve the Downtown as a place of historic, cultural, social, economic and civic vitality."" Very low rents for live/work lofts equipped with special provisions for artists, a nonprofit gallery to exhibit artwork, and very convenient public transportation create an ideal environment for fostering creativity and success. As part of an agreement to provide financing through Low-Income Housing Tax Credits, all of the units are set aside for tenants with incomes at or below 60 percent of area median income. The design incorporates numerous sustainable elements to reduce the use of fossil fuel energy and water usage, and to improve indoor air quality. The project's design also exceeds the immediate need of the program to provide an iconic and richly articulate building that also energizes the neglected city center. Since its opening in late summer of 2009, the Gallery space has had three openings and hosted fundraisers; five new local businesses have opened; and the façade has provided the backdrop for farmers markets, a street fair, kart races, and other community activities. Alan J. Rothman Award for Housing Accessibility - Madrona Live/Work of Seattle, Washington (www.aia.org/practicing/awards/AIAB083020) (Submitting Architect: Tyler Engle). The purpose of this award is to recognize exemplary projects that demonstrate excellence in improving housing accessibility for people with disabilities. A storefront from the early 1900s has been converted into a live/work space for a couple with an extensive art collection. Creating the modern equivalent of the traditional courtyard house, the new design is centered on a large skylight over the living and dining room. Inspired by a shipping container, a wood-clad service core houses the kitchen and power room. A flexible and multifunctional space is facilitated by large pocket doors, steel plate blinders that hide the kitchen, and concealed equipment that pivots out for use. This project transformed the AIA jury's thinking about what traditional accessible design is and what it can be.

06/11/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-121.cfm,HUD Tells Grant Applicants: Don't Discriminate Based on Legal 'Sources of Income' or Risk Funding,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development will begin requiring applicants seeking grant funding to comply with state and local laws that protect individuals from being denied housing based on their lawful source of income. This funding requirement is part of a broader effort by HUD to make certain grant applicants meet state and local anti-discrimination laws, including those prohibiting housing discrimination based on a persons income, such as Section 8 Rental Assistance, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) or earnings from seasonal employment.
This week, HUD published a general funding notice detailing the minimum requirements that will apply to all of the Departments competitively awarded grant programs for Fiscal Year 2010. For the first time, HUD will now require applicants to comply with state and local anti-discrimination laws that prohibit housing discrimination against persons based on their lawful source of income.
""A family's source of income should never be used as a basis to discriminate against them,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""We are sending a very clear message to those who seek federal funds that we intend to stand up for the cause of civil rights and expect them to do the same.""
John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (FHEO), added, ""Prohibiting this form of discrimination provides an essential protection for many Americans, including disabled veterans, seasonal workers, and persons that are using housing choice vouchers to maintain housing for themselves and their children. Racial discrimination is often perpetrated through denials of housing opportunities to Section 8 voucher holders. It is wrong and HUD will now keep systemic violators from applying for HUD funds.""
Earlier this week, HUD also announced that grant applicants and their sub-recipients must comply with state or local laws banning housing discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. HUD's minimum funding requirements will now exclude applicants who have been charged with a systemic violation of state or local law proscribing discrimination in housing based on sexual orientation, gender identity or source of income.
Traditionally, HUD requires all applicants for competitive grant funding to comply with all applicable federal fair housing and civil rights requirements including those expressed in Fair Housing Act; Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act."
06/14/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-122.cfm,FHA Announces New Contracts to Improve System of Maintaining and Selling Inventory of 'HUD Homes',"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced it is awarding contracts to 23 companies to serve as Asset Managers (AM) and 32 other firms to serve as Field Service Managers (FSM) under the third generation of its Management and Marketing (M) program, known as M III. The new contracts announced today are intended to reduce risk, increase sale prices and accelerate the pace of reselling HUD's inventory of foreclosed FHA homes.
Under prior agreements, M contractors were responsible for both maintenance and marketing of the Department's real estate-owned or REO properties. The change announced today separates those functions, which require significantly different skill sets, thereby increasing the effectiveness of the Department's asset disposition program.
""These new contracts epitomize FHA's continuing effort to reduce risk, increase net returns, decrease holding times and improve efficiency in the resale of its inventory of foreclosed properties,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""It is critically important that FHA successfully and efficiently sell its inventory of these properties and these contractors will help us do that.""
Since 1999, HUD has been outsourcing the disposition of its foreclosed FHA inventory under the M contracting process. After conducting extensive research into market-based best practices, HUD developed its new M III disposition structure to streamline its operations, capitalize on the expertise of potential vendors and provide flexibility in a changing environment.
Under M III, the functions of maintaining and selling the property have been separated. The Field Service Managers will be responsible for property maintenance and preservation and the Asset Managers will be responsible for the sale of the homes.
HUD's current inventory of foreclosed FHA property is approximately 44,000 homes. That is up from the usual average level of 35,000 to 40,000. This new system will help HUD deal with this challenge.
There will be multiple Field Service Manager and Asset Manager contractors in most areas. This is expected to foster competition among the contractors thereby improving responsiveness, reducing risk and increasing net returns to the agency. Each contractor will establish an office within its awarded geographic area. These awards are projected to create 1,200 new professional jobs nationwide. HUD's Homeownership Centers in Atlanta, Georgia; Denver, Colorado; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Santa Ana, California will be responsible for the direct oversight of the new contracts within their respective jurisdictions.
The list of awardees for each area is available on the HUD website."
06/15/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-123.cfm,"HUD Charges Owners, Managers of Wisconsin Apartment Complex with Denying Accessible Parking Space to Tenant with Disabilities","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is charging the owner of a Walworth, Wisconsin apartment complex and its management company with discrimination for denying an accessible parking space to a tenant who has difficulty walking. In the charge, HUD alleges that WHPC-DWR, LLC and Cardinal Capital Management, Inc., violated the Fair Housing Act in denying the request of the tenant, who has braces on both legs.
The Fair Housing Act requires landlords to make reasonable accommodations in their rules, policies, practices, or services when needed to provide persons with disabilities an equal opportunity to use or enjoy a dwelling.
""Landlords cannot be indifferent to or deny reasonable accommodation requests of tenants with disabilities,"" stated John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (FHEO). ""Here, the denial resulted in injury. HUD will vigorously enforce legal protections that provide access for people with disabilities.""
According to HUD's charge, the tenant had an accessible parking placard when he moved into Village Square Apartments in Walworth County and he immediately began parking in a designated ""handicap accessible"" space closest to the entrance. Shortly thereafter, management informed him he could not park in that space because it serves as a pick-up and drop-off area for tenants who do not drive. With HUD's encouragement, the tenant renewed his request but management replied, ""That's how we do things.""
Unable to use the designated accessible parking space, the tenant began parking in a space far from the entrance, causing him severe pain in trips to and from his car. In one instance, after parking and beginning to walk towards his unit, he slipped and fell on ice, causing an injury that required emergency medical attention. Not wanting to face another winter without accessible parking, the tenant moved.
The HUD Charge of Discrimination will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) unless a party to the Charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If the ALJ finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, the ALJ may award damages and order injunctive relief and other equitable relief to deter further discrimination. In addition, the ALJ may impose civil penalties in order to vindicate the public interest and award attorney fees. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages to aggrieved persons.
HUD and its partners in the Fair Housing Assistance Program investigate more than 10,000 housing discrimination complaints annually. People who believe they are the victims of housing discrimination should contact HUD at 1-800-669-9777 (voice), 800-927-9275 (TTY)."
06/16/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-124.cfm,HUD Issues 2009 Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress,"WASHINGTON - The total number of homeless persons in America dropped slightly between 2008 and 2009 although the number of homeless families increased, almost certainly due to the ongoing effects of the recession. That's the conclusion of the 2009 Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress, a yearly study by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development designed to measure the scope of homelessness across the country.
HUDs latest report finds that 643,000 persons were homeless on a given night in 2009 while roughly 1.56 million people, or one in every 200 Americans, spent at least one night in a shelter during 2009. While the total estimated number of persons who experience homelessness as individuals declined by 5 percent, the number of homeless families increased for the second straight year.
""As a nation, we appear to be doing a better job sheltering those who might otherwise be living on our streets but clearly homelessness is impacting a greater share of families with children,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""As patterns of homelessness change, we must use the latest data to tailor our response. The Obama Administration is committed to ending homelessness in all its forms.""
HUDs annual assessment is based on two measures of homelessness:
Point-In-Time Snapshot Counts these data account for sheltered and unsheltered homeless persons on a single night, usually at the end of January. On a given night in January 2009, volunteers throughout the nation counted 643,000 homeless people. A majority of these communities reported increases in the number of sheltered persons and decreases in unsheltered or street homeless revealing a greater capacity and success in finding housing solutions for those who are homeless. Long-term or chronic homelessness has continued a pattern of decline in the U.S. since 2006. HUD currently estimates that nearly 111,000 people were chronically homeless on a single night in January 2009, more than a 10 percent drop from 2008 and nearly 30 percent from levels reported in 2006. All of this years decrease in chronic homelessness occurred among the unsheltered street population. Much of the decline since 2006 may be associated with the dramatic expansion of the permanent supportive housing stock, which increased from 177,000 to 219,000 beds during this time period. 12-Month Counts - Using Homeless Management Information Systems (HMIS), these data provide more detailed information on persons who access a shelter over the course of a full year. In the 2009 AHAR, 2,988 counties and 1,056 cities contributed HMIS data to produce national estimates of sheltered homeless. HUD estimates that 1.56 million persons experienced homelessness and found shelter between October 1, 2008 and September 30, 2009. A typical sheltered homeless person is a single, middle-aged man and a member of a minority group. Of all those who sought emergency shelter or transitional housing during 2009, the following characteristics were observed: 78 percent of all sheltered homeless persons are adults. 61 percent are male. 62 percent are members of a minority group. 38 percent are 31-to-50 years old. 64 percent are in one-person households. 38 percent have a disability.

A majority of these communities reported increases in the number of sheltered persons and decreases in unsheltered or street homeless revealing a greater capacity and success in finding housing solutions for those who are homeless. Long-term or chronic homelessness has continued a pattern of decline in the U.S. since 2006. HUD currently estimates that nearly 111,000 people were chronically homeless on a single night in January 2009, more than a 10 percent drop from 2008 and nearly 30 percent from levels reported in 2006. All of this years decrease in chronic homelessness occurred among the unsheltered street population. Much of the decline since 2006 may be associated with the dramatic expansion of the permanent supportive housing stock, which increased from 177,000 to 219,000 beds during this time period.

• 12-Month Counts - Using Homeless Management Information Systems (HMIS), these data provide more detailed information on persons who access a shelter over the course of a full year. In the 2009 AHAR, 2,988 counties and 1,056 cities contributed HMIS data to produce national estimates of sheltered homeless. HUD estimates that 1.56 million persons experienced homelessness and found shelter between October 1, 2008 and September 30, 2009. A typical sheltered homeless person is a single, middle-aged man and a member of a minority group. Of all those who sought emergency shelter or transitional housing during 2009, the following characteristics were observed:
78 percent of all sheltered homeless persons are adults. 61 percent are male. 62 percent are members of a minority group. 38 percent are 31-to-50 years old. 64 percent are in one-person households. 38 percent have a disability.

HUDs report also reveals the following trends:
From 2008-2009:
Between 2008 and 2009, the number of individuals in emergency shelters and transitional housing programs dropped by nearly 58,000 people or 5 percent. Meanwhile, sheltered homeless persons in families increased by almost 19,000 people or 3.6 percent. When families are considered as households rather than as the separate people in the households, the increase was nearly 11,000 families between 2008 and 20098, a seven percent increase over the 159,142 sheltered homeless families in 2008.

From 2007-2009:
Between 2007 and 2009, the drop in the number of sheltered homeless individuals was 80,000 people or about 7 percent. This decline may be related to the ability of communities to place people into an expanding stock of permanent housing, which increased from about 177,000 to 219,000 beds during this time period. In 2009, nearly 62,000 more family members were in emergency shelter or transitional housing at some point during the year than had been in 2007. Considered as households rather than as separate people, the growth in sheltered family homelessness over the three years was almost 40,000 families, representing a 30 percent increase.

Looking Ahead
The long-term impacts of the recession are unclear. A recent study found a nearly five-fold increase in the rate of housing overcrowding, suggesting that many families are doubling up in response to the economic downturn. If some of these family support networks already are struggling to make ends meet, some of the doubled-up families may find their way into the homeless residential service system during 2010.
On the other hand, as the nation comes out of the recession and as the stimulus funding made available through the Homeless Prevention and Re-housing (HPRP) Program starts helping families in crisis avoid shelter, it also is possible that family homelessness will decline during the next reporting period. Indeed, as of May 2010, HPRP has already served more than 350,000 people and approximately 75 percent of the funds have been used for prevention services.

06/16/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-125.cfm,HUD Uses Social Media to Connect with Public and Increase Transparency,"WASHINGTON - In an effort to better serve the American people, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has embraced social media and streamlined its Web site contact tools to facilitate open communication and total transparency.
""When you are seeking information, nothing is more frustrating than not being able to contact someone who can help you get answers to your questions,"" said HUD's web communications architect, Eileen Coleman. ""We believe that communication and transparency are vital, and we are continuously working to improve our communication methods.""
As the new generation of information seekers primarily accesses news and other content through social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter, HUD deemed it essential that the Department get up to speed on today's popular channels of communication. After all, 50 percent of Facebook's 400 million users log on every day, according to Facebook. Furthermore, while only 21 percent of Twitter's 19 million users are active, that's still 3,990,000 people to reach, according to Mashable.com, a respected social media news blog.
HUD also created its own Youtube channel, which currently features Lead Free Kids, a collaborative effort with the Ad Council about lead-based paint, and a short informational video about fair housing. Users access 2 billion videos a day on YouTube, according to the site.

The funds will allow these agencies to make major capital improvements to their public housing units. To view the full list of grantees, visit HUD's website.
""Housing authorities will add this funding to the $4 billion from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 they received last year to continue addressing long-standing capital improvements that public housing communities need,"" said Donovan. ""This funding will also stimulate the economy and create jobs in these communities.""
The funding announced today is allocated through HUD's Capital Fund Program that provides annual funding to public housing authorities to develop, finance, and/or modernize the public housing in their communities. This funding can be used to make large-scale improvements such as new roofs and to make energy-efficient upgrades to replace old plumbing and electrical systems.
While these grants have provided important funding to housing authorities for the past 75 years, HUD is proposing in its 2011 budget a new initiative - Preservation, Enhancement and Transforming Rental Assistance (PETRA) - that, will offer housing authorities options to enable them to leverage public and private financing to address capital needs and make public housing units affordable for the long term. HUD estimates that unfunded capital needs of the nation's 1.2 million public housing units range from $20 to $30 billion.
PETRA would enable federal housing programs to leverage $7 billion in other capital in the first year — and as much as $25 billion in the years to come — giving owners of affordable housing access to the resources they need to preserve this housing into the future. In its 2011 budget proposal before Congress, HUD is requesting $350 million to fund the first phase of the PETRA initiative, which will preserve 300,000 units of public and assisted housing; streamline and increase program administrative efficiency; and enhance housing choice for residents.
HUD Assistant Secretary Sandra Henriquez said, ""This funding is a great resource for housing authorities, but we believe this new approach will give housing authorities a better way to address their capital needs over the long haul."""
06/17/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-06-17.cfm,Over 400 Defendants Charged for Roles in Mortgage Fraud Scheme,"WASHINGTON - The Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced today a national takedown of mortgage fraud schemes, the culmination of substantial coordinated efforts during the last three and a half months to identify, arrest and prosecute mortgage fraud violators through the United States. Operation Malicious Mortgage highlights the strong enforcement response undertaken by the Department of Justice and its law enforcement partners to combat the threat mortgage fraud poses to the U.S. housing industry and worldwide credit markets.
From March 1 to June 18, 2008, Operation Malicious Mortgage resulted in 144 mortgage fraud cases in which 406 defendants were charged. Yesterday, 60 arrests were made in mortgage fraud-related cases in 15 districts. Charges in Operation Malicious Mortgage cases were brought in every region of the United States and in more than 50 judicial districts by U.S. Attorneys' Offices based upon the law enforcement and investigative efforts of participating law enforcement agencies. The FBI estimates that approximately $1 billion in losses were inflicted by the mortgage fraud schemes employed in these cases.
In addition to fraud directly related to individual mortgages, the Department is committed to investigating and prosecuting cases of mortgage-related securities fraud. Today, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York announced an indictment against two senior managers of failed Bear Stearns hedge funds, charging Ralph Cioffi and Mathew Tannin with conspiracy, securities fraud and wire fraud. Cioffi was also charged with insider trading. The indictment alleges that the managers marketed the two funds as a low risk strategy, backed by a pool of debt securities such as mortgages. The indictment alleges that by March 2007, the managers believed the funds were in grave condition and at risk of collapse, but made misrepresentations to stave off investor withdrawal. The funds subsequently collapsed in the summer of 2007 resulting in approximately $1.4 billion in losses to investors.
""Mortgage fraud and related securities fraud pose a significant threat to our economy, to the stability of our nation's housing market and to the peace of mind of millions of American homeowners,"" said Deputy Attorney General Mark R. Filip. ""Operation Malicious Mortgage and our other mortgage-related enforcement actions demonstrate the Justice Department's commitment and determination to combat these criminal schemes, hold their perpetrators accountable and help restore stability and confidence in our housing and credit markets.""
""Operation Malicious Mortgage is a concerted, joint law enforcement and prosecutorial effort aimed at disrupting individuals and groups engaged in mortgage fraud,"" said FBI Director Robert S. Mueller, III. ""This operation is an example of our unified commitment to address this significant crime problem. The FBI will continue to direct investigative and analytic resources towards mortgage fraud and corporate securities fraud that threaten our nation's economy.""
Operation Malicious Mortgage represents the joint collaborative efforts of the FBI, U.S. Postal Inspection Service, Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation Division, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, U.S. Secret Service, U.S. Trustee Program, Department of Housing and Urban Development Office of the Inspector General, Department of Veterans Affairs Office of the Inspector General, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of the Inspector General. Operation Malicious Mortgage is the most recent coordinated sweep in an ongoing law enforcement effort to combat mortgage fraud, which also included Operation Continued Action in 2004 and Operation Quick Flip in 2005.
Mortgage frauds employ a variety of tactics including misrepresentations, deceit and other criminal abuses to fund, purchase or insure mortgage loans. Operation Malicious Mortgage addresses primarily three types of mortgage fraud schemes: lending fraud, foreclosure rescue scams and mortgage-related bankruptcy schemes. Lending fraud frequently involves multiple loan transactions in which industry professionals construct mortgage transactions based on gross fraudulent misrepresentations about the borrower's financial status, such as overstating the borrower's income or assets, using false or fictitious employment records or inflating property values. Foreclosure rescue scams involve criminals who target legitimate homeowners in dire financial circumstances and fraudulently collect fees for foreclosure prevention services or obtain ownership interests in residential properties. Both of these fraudulent mortgage schemes may be furthered by filing bankruptcy petitions that automatically stay foreclosure.
The President's Corporate Fraud Task Force, chaired by Deputy Attorney General Filip, is also responding to issues raised by mortgage fraud in the corporate sector. Created in 2002 to investigate and prosecute significant financial crimes, the Task Force includes representatives from ten federal departments, commissions and agencies, in addition to seven U.S. Attorney's Offices and two Divisions within the Department of Justice, combining the experience of thousands of investigators, attorneys, accountants and regulatory experts. Since July 2002, the Department of Justice has obtained nearly 1,300 corporate fraud convictions, including the convictions of more than 200 chief executive officers and corporate presidents, more than 120 corporate vice presidents and more than 50 chief financial officers.
An indictment is not evidence of guilt. All persons charged with a crime are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.

The funding is provided through a second round of grants under HUD's Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing Program (HUD-VASH) program.
Working closely with local Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Centers, local public housing agencies will target these grants specifically to homeless veterans in their area. Earlier this month, HUD announced $58.6 million in HUD-VASH grants to provide 7,500 vouchers for homeless veterans. For a local breakdown of the vouchers announced today, visit HUD's website.
""These grants are providing real hope to our homeless veterans who might otherwise be forced to live on our streets,"" said Donovan. ""With this additional funding, we'll be able to put a total of nearly 9,000 new vouchers in local communities across the country to help those who served and sacrificed so much for us.""
""This program provides critical assistance to those who have worn our nation's military uniforms and are in need of a home,"" said VA Secretary Eric K. Shinseki. ""VA and HUD will continue to work in partnership to end homelessness among veterans.""
The grants announced today are part of a $75 million investment to support the needs of homeless veterans. On June 3, 2010, HUD announced the first round of funding - $58.6 million that supported nearly 8,000 vouchers. The remaining funds will be awarded to housing agencies later this summer. Local public housing agencies that administer HUD's Housing Choice Voucher Program (HCV) work closely with VA Medical Centers to manage the program. In addition to the rental assistance, VAMCs provide supportive services and case management to eligible homeless veterans.
HUD allocates the these housing vouchers to local public housing agencies, which will target them to homeless veterans based on a variety of factors, including the number of reported homeless veterans and the proximity of a local VA Medical Centers with the capacity to provide case management. These medical centers identify eligible participants and provide case management. VA case managers will also work directly with local housing agencies that are administering the HUD-VASH program to determine income eligibility and help participants find suitable housing.
Veterans participating in the HUD-VASH program rent privately owned housing and generally contribute no more than 30 percent of their income toward rent. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs offers eligible homeless veterans clinical and supportive services through its medical centers across the U.S. and Puerto Rico.
This is the third year HUD is supporting the housing and service needs of homeless veterans across America through HUD-VASH with a total investment of $225 million that will sustain approximately 30,000 rental assistance vouchers.
On Tuesday, June 22, the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH) - which includes HUD and VA - will release the nation's first comprehensive strategy to prevent and end homelessness. The HEARTH Act, signed into law by President Obama in May 2009 mandated that USICH present to Congress a ""national strategic plan"" to end homelessness. Beginning in January 2010, USICH held regional stakeholder meetings, organized federal working groups focused on specific populations, solicited public comment through an interactive website, and engaged experts from across the country to develop an action plan to solve homelessness for veterans, adults, families, youth, and children."
06/18/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-128.cfm,HUD Charges New Hampshire Landlord with Discriminating Against Interethnic Couple,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today announced that it is charging a Monroe, New Hampshire, landlord with violating the Fair Housing Act for harassment of tenants who are an interethnic couple. According to HUD's charge, landlord Lothar Riba told a female tenant that he didn't think it was appropriate for her to be married to a ""Spanish guy.""
HUD alleges that Riba harassed and threatened the family by monitoring and photographing their activity, removing their apartment's window handles, and physically assaulting and injuring the wife. Riba allegedly told the wife that she should get her ""monkey"" family off of his property and that her Hispanic sister in-law could not visit, remarking, ""If one comes, they all start coming like a bunch of cockroaches.""
""Ethnic harassment by landlords or housing providers is unacceptable and against the law,"" said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Harassment victims are not alone in this fight to protect their rights. HUD works vigorously to eradicate discrimination.""
The Fair Housing Act makes it illegal to discriminate based on national origin, including making statements indicating a preference or limitation based on national origin, and engaging in conduct that threatens or intimidates tenants in the exercise of their rights protected under the Act.
The HUD charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to the family for its losses and order injunctive relief and other equitable relief to deter further discrimination. In addition, the judge may impose fines in order to vindicate the public interest and award attorney fees. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages to aggrieved persons.
FHEO and its partners in the Fair Housing Assistance Program investigate more than 10,000 housing discrimination complaints annually. People who believe they are the victims of housing discrimination should contact HUD at 1-800-669-9777 (voice), 800-927-9275 (TTY)."
06/21/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-06-21.cfm,Obama Administration Introduces Monthly Housing Scorecard,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of the Treasury today introduced a monthly scorecard on the nation's housing market. Each month, the scorecard will incorporate key housing market indicators and highlight the impact of the Administration's unprecedented housing recovery efforts, including assistance to homeowners through the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP). This scorecard contains key data on the health of the housing market including:
After 30 straight months of decline and an expectation of continued nearly 14 percent decline, home prices leveled off in the past year and expectations have adjusted upward Mortgages are more affordable: due to historically low interest rates, more than 6 million homeowners have refinanced, saving an estimated $150 per month on average and more than $11 billion in total. And more than 2.5 million families have purchased a home using the First-Time Homebuyer Tax Credit. Servicers report that the number of homeowners receiving restructured mortgages since April 2009 has increased to 2.8 million. Additionally, nearly half of homeowners unable to enter a HAMP permanent modification enter an alternative modification with their servicer, and fewer than 10 percent of cancelled trials move to foreclosure sale. However, the foreclosure prevention initiatives are not intended to help all borrowers and the market will continue to adjust for some time. The supply of homes on and off market remains near all-time highs. It will take time to work though this large inventory.

""We already know that due to the Obama Administration's efforts, the housing market is significantly better than anyone predicted a year ago,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""This scorecard will allow the American people to monitor the Administration's efforts to strengthen the housing market on a monthly basis and hold the government and industry accountable. Demonstrating the progress in the housing market due to the Administration's policies, this month's report provides a broad set of indicators showing encouraging signs of recovery.""
""The Administration's housing policies, combined with actions of the Fed, have lowered mortgage interest rates, helped stabilize home prices and reduced the rate of foreclosures, repairing some of the damage caused by the financial crisis to the financial security of millions and millions of American families,"" said Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner. ""And the Administration's loan modification programs have given more than a million responsible homeowners a chance to stay in their homes. We are going to keep working to help the Americans hardest hit by this crisis, and as we do we will make sure we are careful stewards of the scarce resources of the American taxpayer.""
The Administration's goal is to promote stability for both the housing market and homeowners. To meet these objectives, the Administration developed a broad based approach including state and local housing agency initiatives, tax credits for homebuyers, neighborhood stabilization and community development programs, mortgage modifications and refinancings, and support for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These efforts build on Federal Reserve and Treasury mortgage backed securities purchase programs that have helped to keep mortgage interest rates to record lows over the past year.
These initiatives have resulted in measurable progress, particularly in affordability of mortgage credit across the market. Low interest rates have helped more than 6 million families refinance, resulting in more stable home prices and $11 billion in total borrower savings. More than 2.5 million Americans purchased a home using the First-Time Homebuyer Tax Credit, helping to further stabilize home prices.
At the same time, FHA has helped maintain affordability by playing an important backstop role, stepping in to support home purchase and refinance activity at a time when private capital was fleeing the mortgage market. In addition, the FHA helped nearly 400,000 homeowners stay in their homes since April 2009 through FHA loss mitigation efforts, which include modification options. While providing access to affordable mortgage capital and helping homeowners prevent foreclosures, the FHA has also taken unprecedented administrative and regulatory steps to improve risk management and has pursued essential reforms to strengthen its finances.
Servicers report that the number of homeowners receiving restructured mortgages since April 2009 has increased to 2.8 million. This includes more than 1.2 million homeowners who have started HAMP trial modifications and nearly 400,000 who have benefitted from FHA loss mitigation activities. Of those in the HAMP program, 346,000 have entered a permanent modification saving a median of more than $500 per month.
The housing scorecard now incorporates the monthly Making Home Affordable Program Servicer Performance Report (www.financialstability.gov/docs/May%20MHA%20Public%20062110.pdf), including HAMP modification data that once again shows a month-over-month increase in permanent modifications, with average growth of roughly 50,000 permanent modifications per month over the last four months. Servicer data indicates close to half of the homeowners in HAMP trial modifications who were ultimately ineligible for a HAMP permanent modification were offered an alternative modification and less than 10 percent move to foreclosure sale In addition to the modifications through HAMP, servicers have adopted the HAMP guidelines as an industry standard and are now initiating their own modification agreements incorporating many of the HAMP affordability principles. Homeowners who cannot afford a modified payment under HAMP may also be eligible for the Administration's Foreclosure Alternatives Program, to help relocate to more affordable housing that is sustainable over the long term.
The housing scorecard details new reporting on both the scope of Treasury's compliance activities and the areas of focus for compliance reviews under HAMP. Compliance activities include on-site reviews, file reviews and reviews of net present value (NPV) model applications. Also included are the first-ever results of compliance-related ""second look"" reviews of select servicers to ensure that potentially eligible borrowers were solicited and properly evaluated for HAMP. Treasury's compliance activities will lead to improvements in servicer performance and process improvements designed to minimize the likelihood that borrower applications are overlooked or that applicants are inadvertently denied a modification.

06/21/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-131.cfm,"USDOT and HUD Launch Groundbreaking, Collaborative Effort to Create Sustainable, Livable Communities","U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood and U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan today announced a groundbreaking collaborative effort designed to help foster planning for more livable, sustainable communities - places where transportation, housing and commercial development investments are coordinated to better serve the people living in those communities.
Together, the U.S. Departments of Transportation (DOT) and Housing and Urban Development (HUD), for the first time ever, will join forces to award up to $75 million in funding - $35 million in TIGER (Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery) II Planning Grants and $40 million in Sustainable Community Challenge Grants for localized planning activities that ultimately lead to projects that integrate transportation, housing and economic development.
""This joint effort by DOT and HUD is a giant step toward improved coordination at the state, federal and local levels and reinforces the Obama Administration's commitment to finding better ways to make government work for people,"" said Vice President Joe Biden. ""Together, their investments will strengthen communities by connecting housing and transportation options, increasing economic opportunities, promoting environmental sustainability and improving their overall quality of life.""
""This is another example of the Obama Administration giving the American taxpayer a bigger bang for the buck. The winners will be the people who live in communities and have access to travel options that better serve them,"" said Secretary LaHood.
""This partnership demonstrates President Obama's commitment to changing the way the federal government operates by breaking down silos and making smarter investments,"" said Secretary Donovan. ""This is the first time HUD and DOT have worked together to develop a joint grant program. For the first time, federal agencies are truly collaborating with each other to make government work better and build the kinds of communities where families can prosper.""
The new program builds on the Partnership for Sustainable Communities, an innovative new interagency collaboration, launched by President Obama in June 2009, between the Department of Transportation (DOT), the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Guided by six Livability Principles (www.epa.gov/dced/partnership/index.html#livabilityprinciples), the Partnership is designed to remove the traditional federal government silos that exist between departments and strategically target the agencies' transportation, land use, environmental, housing and community development resources to provide communities the resources they need to build more livable, sustainable communities.
TIGER II Planning Grants may be used to plan, prepare or design surface transportation projects that would be eligible for funding under the TIGER II Discretionary Grant program. These projects include highways, bridges, transit, railways, ports or bicycle and pedestrian facilities.
HUD's Sustainable Communities funding will target urban and community planning projects that foster reform and reduce barriers to achieving affordable, economically vital and sustainable communities. Such efforts may include amending or replacing local master plans, zoning codes, and building codes either on a jurisdiction-wide basis or in a specific neighborhood or sector to promote mixed-use development, affordable housing and the re-use of older buildings for new purposes with the goal of promoting sustainability at the local level.
These activities, when done in conjunction with transportation projects, can greatly increase the efficiency and effectiveness local transportation, and access to it, while encouraging mixed-use or transit-oriented development. The program will encourage and reward areas that are planning more innovative projects that coordinate housing, economic development and transportation investments.
There are a variety of projects that may include component parts that fall under both the DOT TIGER II Planning Grants and the HUD Sustainable Community Challenge Grants. Rather than have applicants proceed through two separate grant application procedures that might be on different timelines and with different requirements, this joint notice of funding availability (NOFA) is intended to create one point of entry to federal resources.
Examples could include the following:
Planning activities that support the development of affordable housing near transportation through the adoption of inclusionary zoning ordinances and other activities such as acquisition of land for affordable housing projects. Preparing or amending local codes and ordinances that prevent the private sector from developing neighborhoods more sustainably and inclusively, with housing located near transportation and retail. Planning activities related to the development of a particular transportation corridor or regional transportation system that promotes mixed-use or transit-oriented development with an affordable housing component. Planning activities related to the development of a freight corridor that seeks to reduce conflicts with residential areas and with passenger and non-motorized traffic.

06/22/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-132.cfm,Obama Administration Unveils National Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness,"WASHINGTON - Today, the lead Cabinet secretaries from the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH) - from the U.S. Departments of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Labor (DOL), Health and Human Services (HHS), and Veterans Affairs (VA) - joined Executive Director of the USICH Barbara Poppe to unveil and submit to the President and Congress the nation's first comprehensive strategy to prevent and end homelessness. Domestic Policy Council Director Melody Barnes accepted the plan on behalf of President Barack Obama. The full report, titled Opening Doors: Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness, is available at www.usich.gov.
The USICH is chaired by HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan and the Vice Chair is Labor Secretary Hilda Solis. The 19 member agencies span the nation's housing, health, job, education, and human services to coordinate the Federal response to homelessness and to create a national partnership at every level of government and with the private sector to reduce and end homelessness in the nation while maximizing the effectiveness of the Federal government in contributing to the end of homelessness.
""As the most far-reaching and ambitious plan to end homelessness in our history, this plan will both strengthen existing programs and forge new partnerships,"" said Donovan. ""Working together with Congress, state and local officials, faith-based and community organizations, and business and philanthropic leaders across our country, we will harness public and private resources to build on the innovations that have been demonstrated at the local level nationwide. No one should be without a safe, stable place to call home and today we unveil a plan that will put our nation on the path toward ending all types of homelessness.""
By combining permanent housing with support services, federal, state, and local efforts have reduced the number of people who are chronically homeless by one-third in the last five years.
""Communities across the country have stressed the need for federal leadership to prevent and end homelessness,"" said USICH Executive Director Poppe. ""For the first time, the nation will have goals, strategies, and measureable outcomes that will guide us toward a fiscally prudent government response. Local, state, and federal governments cannot afford to invest in anything but the most evidence-based, cost-effective strategies.""
In recent years, over 300 communities have developed plans to end homelessness. ""We know that the Federal government alone cannot address this challenge,"" said USICH Vice Chair and Labor Secretary Hilda Solis. ""Achieving the goals in Opening Doors will require strong partnerships with Congress, states, localities, philanthropy, and faith based and community organizations across the country. After all, the people of our nation are best served when we work as a team.""
Opening Doors serves as a roadmap for joint action by the 19 USICH member agencies along with local and state partners in the public and private sectors. The plan puts us on a path to end veterans and chronic homelessness by 2015, and to ending homelessness among children, family, and youth by 2020. The Plan presents strategies building upon the lesson that mainstream housing, health, education, and human service programs must be fully engaged and coordinated to prevent and end homelessness, including:
Increasing leadership, collaboration, and civic engagement, by a focus on providing and promoting collaborative leadership at all levels of government and across all sectors and strengthening the capacity of public and private organizations by increasing knowledge about collaboration and successful interventions to prevent and end homelessness. Increase access to stable and affordable housing, by providing affordable housing and permanent supportive housing. Increase economic security, expand meaningful and sustainable employment and improve access to mainstream programs and services to reduce financial vulnerability to homelessness. Improve health and stability, by linking health care with homeless assistance programs and housing, advancing stability for youth aging out of systems such as foster care and juvenile justice, and improving discharge planning for people who have frequent contact with hospitals and criminal justice systems. Retool the homeless response system, by transforming homeless services to crisis response systems that prevent homelessness and rapidly return people who experience homelessness to stable housing.

The HEARTH Act, enacted by Congress in May 2009 mandated that the USICH produce a ""national strategic plan"" to end homelessness to Congress and the President. Beginning in January 2010, USICH held regional stakeholder meetings, organized federal working groups focused on specific populations, solicited public comment through an interactive website, and engaged experts from across the country to develop an action plan to solve homelessness for veterans, adults, families, youth, and children."
06/24/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-133.cfm,HUD Secretary Donovan Announces $100 Million in Grants Available as Part of New Sustainable Regional Planning Grant Program,"WASHINGTON - During a keynote address to The Atlantic's inaugural Future of the City Forum in Washington, D.C., U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Shaun Donovan today announced that HUD is launching a $100 million Sustainable Communities Regional Planning Grant program, the first of its kind designed to create stronger, more sustainable communities by connecting housing to jobs, fostering local innovation and building a clean energy economy.
The Regional Planning grants will be awarded competitively to multi-jurisdictional and multi-sector partnerships as well as regional consortia consisting of state and local governments, metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs), educational institutions, non-profit organizations and philanthropic organizations. The funding was approved by Congress for the first time in HUD's 2010 budget, as part of a $200 million fund for the agency's new Office of Sustainable Housing and Communities. To read the full text of HUD's funding announcement, visit HUD's Sustainability website.
""At HUD, and across the Administration, we believe that the ""future of the city"" is tied to the future of the region-the cities, suburbs and rural areas that surround them, and that America's ability to compete and create jobs in the 21st century depends on our metro regions,"" said Donovan. ""That is why I am proud to say we are taking another big step forward in the Obama Administration's efforts to encourage more sustainable development as I announce $100 million for our new Sustainable Regional Planning Grant program for regions to integrate economic development, land use, and transportation investments.""
""The Sustainable Communities Partnership is one part of President Obama's broader urban and metropolitan agenda, which aims to break down traditional silos and ensure that federal programs and policies across all agencies better respond to the unique needs of specific communities,"" said Melody Barnes, President Obama's Domestic Policy Adviser. ""The Administration's efforts aim to develop urban and metropolitan areas that are economically competitive, environmentally sustainable and socially inclusive.""
The funding being announced today will support regional planning efforts that integrate housing, land use, economic and workforce development, transportation, and infrastructure investments in a manner that empowers jurisdictions to consider the interdependent challenges of economic competitiveness and revitalization; social equity, inclusion, and access to opportunity; energy use and climate change; as well as public health and environmental impacts. The program places a priority on partnerships, including nontraditional partnerships including arts and culture, philanthropy, and bringing new voices to the regional planning process.
The program will support a number of activities related to the development and implementation of integrated long-range regional plans including, but not limited to:
identifying affordable housing, transportation investment, water infrastructure, economic development, land use planning, environmental conservation, energy system, open space, and other infrastructure priorities for the region; establishing performance goals and measures; providing detailed plans, policies, and implementation strategies to be implemented by all participating jurisdictions over time to meet planning goals; engaging residents and stakeholders substantively and meaningfully in the development of the shared vision and its implementation.
• identifying affordable housing, transportation investment, water infrastructure, economic development, land use planning, environmental conservation, energy system, open space, and other infrastructure priorities for the region;
• establishing performance goals and measures;
• providing detailed plans, policies, and implementation strategies to be implemented by all participating jurisdictions over time to meet planning goals;
• engaging residents and stakeholders substantively and meaningfully in the development of the shared vision and its implementation.
The program builds on the Partnership for Sustainable Communities, an innovative interagency collaboration, launched by President Obama in June 2009, between the Department of Transportation (DOT), the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to provide more sustainable housing and transportation choices for families and lay the foundation for a 21st century economy. Guided by six Livability Principles, the Partnership is designed to remove the traditional silos that exist between federal departments and strategically target the agencies' transportation, land use, environmental, housing and community development resources to provide communities the resources they need to build more livable, sustainable communities.
Recognizing that areas are in different stages of achieving sustainability, HUD established two funding categories for the Sustainable Communities Regional Planning Grant program. Category 1 Funds can be used to support the preparation of Regional Plans for Sustainable Development. Category 2 Funds can be used to support efforts to fine-tune existing regional plans so that they address the Partnership's Livability Principles, to prepare more detailed execution plans for an adopted Regional Plan for Sustainable Development, and limited predevelopment planning activities for catalytic projects. Of the funds available, $2 million will be reserved for capacity support grants distributed separately, and not less than $25 million will be awarded to regions with populations of less than 500,000.
Ultimately, this regional planning initiative will provide a blueprint for public and private investment decisions that will support a more sustainable future for a region. The size of grants awarded will be determined by the size of the applicants geographic area, whether a large metropolitan region or a smaller rural community. Grant applications, which will be reviewed not only by HUD, but also by the Department of Transportation and the Environmental Protection Agency, are due August 23, 2010.
To demonstrate HUD's commitment to listening and learning, HUD issued an advance Notice of Funding Availability in February 2010, which was posted on the Federal Register for 21 days for public comment and feedback. Many of the comments received through that process where integrated into the final Notice.
In addition, Secretary Donovan and HUD are committed to providing the highest level of transparency possible as the Office of Sustainable Communities works to streamline federal investments. HUD's new sustainability website will allow tax payers to see where funds are being spent and hold federal leaders accountable, and for local partners to access valuable information and resources."
06/24/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-134.cfm,"DOT, HUD Announce New Contracting Flexibility to Help Build Sustainable, Livable Communities","Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan today announced new contracting efforts that will enhance livability and sustainability initiatives and improve competition for federal highway projects.
The new process removes conflicting HUD and Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) contracting requirements, giving state and local agencies more flexibility. In addition, it promotes livable and sustainable communities, places where transportation, housing and commercial development investments have been coordinated so that people have access to adequate, affordable and environmentally sustainable travel options near their homes, by delivering projects sooner and at reduced costs. The new process does not allow transportation dollars to be used for housing related improvements.
""We are committed to innovation, removing barriers to employment, improving livability and improving government service to the American people,"" said Secretary LaHood. ""Bringing these two programs together gives Americans more for their tax dollar.""
""This is another example of the Obama Administration's commitment to changing the way the federal government operates and making it work better for Americans by breaking down silos and making smarter investments,"" said Donovan. ""This will extend the impact of federal investment from buildings and roads directly to economic opportunities for low-income people and the companies who hire them.""
A notice published in the Federal Register, will permit - on a case-by-case basis - the application of HUD local hiring requirements on projects funded by FHWA.
Current HUD contracting rules, which require that low-income people living in a project area be hired as a condition of funding that project, conflict with FHWA rules that discourage hiring preferences. Consequently, states managing projects like street reconstructions near HUD-managed properties must award two contracts: one for FHWA-funded roadwork, and another for HUD-funded work, such as the relocation of underground sewers, utilities or water pipes serving the HUD property.
Today's Federal Register notice invites states to submit proposals to FHWA that improve contracting efficiencies while enhancing livability and sustainability in projects funded jointly with HUD. The proposals will be evaluated based on the extent to which HUD funding may be used for highway projects, the effects on competition whenever HUD's local hiring preferences are applied on a joint FHWA/HUD project, and the extent to which the alignment of FHWA and HUD requirements improve livability and sustainability.
Moving to one larger, more inclusive contract would likely widen the appeal of such work to potential contractors, and eliminating multiple small contracts would save taxpayers money.
This initiative builds on the Partnership for Sustainable Communities, an innovative new interagency collaboration, launched by President Obama in June 2009, between the Department of Transportation (DOT), the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Guided by six Livability Principles, the Partnership is designed to remove the traditional federal government silos that exist between departments and strategically target the agencies' transportation, land use, environmental, housing and community development resources to provide communities the resources they need to build more livable, sustainable communities."
06/25/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-135.cfm,HUD Proposes New Rule to Allow On-Site Completion of Factory-Built Manufactured Homes,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced that it is proposing new regulations that would permit builders of manufactured housing (mobile homes) to complete construction at the home's installation site, rather than in the factory. Under current HUD regulations, a manufacturer must obtain HUD approval for on-site completion of each of its designs.
HUD's proposed rule (http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2010/pdf/2010-15088.pdf) would simplify the manufactured housing construction process by establishing new uniform procedures that would, under certain circumstances, permit manufacturers to complete construction of their homes at the installation site without obtaining advance approval from HUD. The proposed regulations would not apply when a major section of a manufactured home is to be constructed on-site. Public comment to this rule is due by August 23, 2010.
2 FONT standards. safety and construction HUD's with conformance into home the bring to required work limited be also would rule proposed this by covered that on-site The practicable. not factory in of completion because warranted is partial when part integral an as built components installation allow regulation addition, In systems. plumbing or cooling heating, such systems assemblies structural include for qualifying Construction.
2 The National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974 authorizes HUD to establish and amend home construction and safety standards for the industry. It also authorizes HUD to conduct inspections and investigations necessary to enforce these standards.
The Manufactured Housing Consensus Committee (MHCC) contributed to the draft of this proposed rule. MHCC is a Federal Advisory Committee authorized by law to provide HUD with recommendations regarding Federal manufactured housing construction and safety standards and related procedural and enforcement regulations. It is composed of 21 voting members representing manufacturers, retailers, consumers, organizations with interest in manufactured housing, and public officials."
06/29/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-136.cfm,HUD Accuses New York Apartment Management Company with Discriminating Against Child with Disabilities,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today announced that it is charging an Albany, New York-area apartment management company with violating the Fair Housing Act by denying a child who has disabilities a reasonable accommodation and retaliating against her family. According to HUD's charge, Paulsen Development Company effectively barred the child from using the apartment complex swimming pool by prohibiting her needed service animal from accompanying her. After her mother complained to HUD, the company refused to renew their lease.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to refuse to grant persons with disabilities reasonable accommodations, including allowing the use of service animals. The Fair Housing Act also prohibits retaliating against a person for having exercised their fair housing rights.
""Without their service animal, many people with disabilities are unable to use their homes,"" said John Trasviña, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will protect their right to a service animal and to be free from retaliation if they assert their rights.""
The service dog, prescribed by her doctor, is essential for daily tasks such as retrieving items, opening doors, turning light switches and carrying school books. According to the child's doctor, the service animal promotes the child's independence by decreasing her reliance on others.
According to the Charge, Paulson Development initially refused to allow the girl to have a service animal in the apartment. Later, management allowed the child to have the service dog in her unit, but refused to allow the animal to assist her in the pool area. After her mother protested, management refused to renew their lease and gave the family 60 days to vacate the apartment.
The HUD charge will be heard by either a United States Administrative Law Judge or in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to the family for its losses and order injunctive relief and other equitable relief to deter further discrimination. In addition, the judge may impose fines in order to vindicate the public interest and award attorney fees. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages to the aggrieved persons.
FHEO and its partners in the Fair Housing Assistance Program investigate more than 10,000 housing discrimination complaints annually. People who believe they are the victims of housing discrimination should contact HUD at 1-800-669-9777 (voice), 800-927-9275 (TTY)."
06/29/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-137.cfm,HUD Awards $30 Million to 29 Local HIV-AIDS Housing Programs,"WASHINGTON - More than a thousand extremely low-income persons living with HIV/AIDS will continue to receive permanent housing as a result of $30.2 million in grants announced today by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). During each of the next three years, this HUD funding will help provide permanent supportive housing for 1,232 households so they can manage their illnesses while receiving critically needed support services.
The funding announced today is offered through HUD's Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS Program (HOPWA) and will renew HUD's support of 29 local programs in 19 states (see attached chart and individual project descriptions below).
""These programs are a critical source of support to local programs on the front lines of helping families stay healthy,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""A stable home can make all the difference to the wellbeing of these families, many of whom have been homeless or at extreme risk of homelessness.""
These projects have estimated that about 40% of the households to be assisted will involve persons who have been homeless. The grants announced today also support the Obama Administration's new strategic plan to prevent and end homelessness (www.usich.gov/PDF/OpeningDoors_2010_FSPPreventEndHomeless.pdf), an unprecedented initiative announced last week at the White House.
Housing assistance and related services funded by HOPWA are an essential part of the comprehensive system of care for low-income persons living with HIV/AIDS. A stable home environment is also vital for these households in allowing them to access consistent medical care and maintain their health. Furthermore, secure housing can be a platform for improved quality of life.
Ninety percent of HOPWA funds are distributed by formula to cities and states based on the number of AIDS cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. HUD's formula grants are managed by 123 local and state jurisdictions, which coordinate AIDS housing efforts with other HUD and community resources. Up eight percent from last year, HUD is making available a record $335 million inHOPWA funds this year to help communities provide housing for this special needs population. Overall, these resources assist 58,367 households annually to promote stable housing and reduced risks of homelessness for those living with HIV and other challenges."
07/01/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-138.cfm,HUD Releases 2009 American Housing Survey,"WASHINGTON - Most families with young children live within a mile of a public elementary school. The most common home heating fuel in the U.S. is gas. Only a third of American homes have a working carbon monoxide detector. These are just some of the findings of a comprehensive national sample of the more than 130 million residential housing units released today by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
HUD's 2009 American Housing Survey (AHS) (www.census.gov/programs-surveys/ahs/) is the most thorough look inside the homes of millions of Americans and reveals everything from the square footage of the unit to how many homes have front porches, garages or even usable fireplaces. First conducted in 1973, the survey's long-term design allows analysts to trace the characteristics of U.S. housing units and their occupants. For example, the 2009 survey reveals that significantly more American homes are larger and have more bedrooms and bathrooms than homes 37 years ago. In addition, homes of 1973 were significantly less likely to have central air conditioning and other amenities considered commonplace today.
""This important survey provides us a clear picture of the American home and its occupants,"" said Dr. Raphael Bostic, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research. ""The housing crisis makes clear the need for continued collection of high quality housing data to help us understand housing markets. The numbers behind this survey not only provide valuable information on the composition of our housing stock, but they also help us monitor the mortgage markets, measure worst-case housing needs, and inform our policy choices.""
The 2009 AHS includes enhanced data for five metropolitan areas: Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia, New York and Northern New Jersey. For the first time ever, the AHS also includes data on disability status of household members. The new AHS also includes two independent metropolitan surveys of New Orleans and Seattle. Last conducted in 2004, the New Orleans survey in particular will provide an in-depth progress report of the redevelopment of the metro area following the hurricanes of 2005.
There are 130,112,000 residential housing units in the U.S.; 86 percent of these are occupied. The median age of 'the American home' is 36 years, though the survey finds that homes newly constructed since the 2007 AHS are generally larger, more expensive, have more bedrooms and bathrooms, and are more likely to include amenities such as central air conditioning. Some of the other key findings of the 2009 AHS include: 68 percent of U.S. homes are owner-occupied; 51 percent are located in suburban areas; 29 percent in central cities; and 20 percent outside metropolitan areas; and 18 percent are located in the Northeast; 23 percent in the Midwest; 37 percent in the South; and 22 percent in the West.
Unit Size
The median size of an occupied home is 1,800 square feet (compared to 1,610 in 1985, the earliest year this information was collected), with owner-occupied units being larger than renter-occupied ones. Newer Homes are also usually larger, with median size of 2,300 square feet. Median lot size for single-family homes, including mobile homes, is 0.27 acres (compared to .36 acres in 1973) with owner-occupied units generally having more land than renter-occupied ones.

07/01/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-139.cfm,HUD Issues Guidance on LGBT Housing Discrimination Complaints,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced a new policy that provides lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) individuals and families with further assistance when facing housing discrimination. The new guidance treats gender identity discrimination most often faced by transgender persons as gender discrimination under the Fair Housing Act, and instructs HUD staff to inform individuals filing complaints about state and local agencies that have LGBT-inclusive discrimination laws. HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan announced the new guidance at HUD's LGBT Pride Month Celebration.
""Our job to prevent and combat housing discrimination is not complete without addressing 21st Century issues,"" stated John Trasviña, Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Our fair housing staff will work with state and local civil rights agencies to investigate and refer discrimination cases and work to combat all aspects of gender discrimination.""
The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in rental, sales and lending on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, gender, disability and familial status. Approximately 20 states, and the District of Columbia, and over 60 cities, towns and counties across the nation have additional protections that specifically prohibit such discrimination against LGBT individuals.Under the guidance announced today, HUD will, as appropriate, retain its jurisdiction over complaints filed by LGBT individuals or families but also jointly investigate or refer matters to those state, district and local governments with other legal protections.
For example, if a man alleges that he is being evicted because he is gay and his landlord believes he will infect other tenants with HIV, then the allegation of discrimination may be jurisdictional under the Fair Housing Act based on disability because the man is regarded as having a disability, HIV/AIDS. Similarly, if a female prospective tenant is alleging discrimination by a landlord because she wears masculine clothes and engages in other physical expressions that are stereotypically male, then the allegations may be jurisdictional under the Act as discrimination based on gender.
Last October, HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan announced a series of measures to ensure that the agency's core housing programs are open to all, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. Earlier this month, HUD announced that it will require grant applicants seeking HUD funding to comply with state and local anti-discrimination laws that protect LGBT individuals. In addition, HUD intends to propose new regulations that will clarify that the term ""family"" as used to describe eligible beneficiaries of HUD's programs include otherwise eligible LGBT individuals and couples. The Department's intent to propose new regulations will clarify family status to ensure its core housing programs are available to all families, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.
The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) will also instruct its lending community that FHA-insured mortgage loans must be based on the credit-worthiness of borrowers and not on unrelated factors or characteristics such as sexual orientation or gender identity. Finally, HUD will commission the first-ever national study of discrimination against members of the LGBT community in the rental and sale of housing. The Department is currently seeking online public comment from interested parties in how it might design this new study."
07/01/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-140.cfm,"NEA Chairman Landesman and HUD Secretary Donovan Invite the Arts Community and Creative Sector to Participate in Funding Opportunities Designed to Create More Livable, Sustainable Communities","Washington, DC - National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) Chairman Rocco Landesman and U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Shaun Donovan today issued an invitation to the arts and creative sector to participate in a joint webinar on Wednesday, July 7, 2010 at 3:00 p.m. EDT to learn about two new, innovative community development funding opportunities.
Last week, HUD and the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) released two Notices of Funding Availability (NOFAs): $100 million in grants available through HUD's Sustainable Communities Regional Planning Grant Program, and up to $75 million in grants available through a joint HUD and DOT Sustainable Communities Challenge Grant Program. Under both programs, arts organizations are eligible to partner with state and local governments, metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs), transit agencies, philanthropic and non-profit organizations and other eligible applicants to develop consortia grant proposals.
""The arts are a natural component to furthering this Administration's commitment to creating more livable, walkable, environmentally sustainable communities,"" said HUD Secretary Donovan. ""They can play a key role as a partner that is able to enhance the unique characteristics of communities and increase our economic competitiveness through supporting creativity and innovation.""
""The arts are creative placemakers,"" said NEA Chairman Landesman. ""We are able to work alongside federal agencies like HUD to help create places where people want to live work and play, both today and in the future.""
Both programs build on the Partnership for Sustainable Communities, an innovative interagency collaboration, launched by President Obama in June 2009, between the Department of Transportation (DOT), the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to provide more sustainable housing and transportation choices for families and lay the foundation for a 21st century economy. Guided by six Livability Principles, the Partnership is designed to remove the traditional silos that exist between federal departments and strategically target the agencies' transportation, land use, environmental, housing and community development resources to provide communities the resources they need to build more livable, sustainable communities.
This is the first time that HUD and the NEA have co-convened the arts and creative sector on a national level around funding opportunities, and it demonstrates the Obama Administration's commitment to changing the way the federal government operates by working more collaboratively across federal agencies and making smarter investments. The Sustainable Communities Regional Planning Grant Program is the first HUD Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) that explicitly contains language encouraging the arts community to participate in the consortia submitting applications.
Anyone interested in participating in the webinar should log on to HUD's website at 3:00 p.m. EDT on Wednesday, July 7th, 2010."
07/02/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-141.cfm,HUD Expands Neighborhood Stabilization Program in Cuyahoga County,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today announced an agreement with the Cuyahoga County Land Reutilization Corporation (CCLRC) to stabilize neighborhoods hard-hit by foreclosure in Cleveland and Cuyahoga County by selling foreclosed homes to the CCLRC for as little as $100. The agreement announced today follows a similar successful program launched in Cleveland in which HUD transferred 441 foreclosed properties to the City at deep discount in just over a year.
""We are committed to helping communities reverse the effects of neighborhood decline,"" said HUD Secretary, Shaun Donovan. ""This agreement builds upon a variety of programs HUD offers municipalities to enable them to acquire HUD properties at a discount. Now that we have proven that these efforts work in Cleveland, we hope to do the same throughout Cuyahoga County. In addition, this discount sales program will leverage $41 million HUD awarded to the Cuyahoga County Land Reutilization Corporation through the Recovery Act's Neighborhood Stabilization Program. Through our coordinated efforts CCLRC has the financial capacity and flexibility to acquire properties not only from HUD but also from any real estate entity as well.""
Senator Sherrod Brown said, ""This is a victory for Cuyahoga County. As we work to rebuild our communities devastated by the housing crisis, it's critical that our efforts aren't undermined by out-of-state speculators. A local response to the housing crisis is in the best interest of Ohio communities and our nation's economic recovery.""
Rep. Dennis J. Kucinich added, ""I got on this in May as soon as I learned the program was in trouble. I'm glad to have worked with HUD to help reinstate it.""
""This is a win for the people of my District,"" said Rep. Marcia L. Fudge. ""I'm pleased to see HUD implement a program that will put the needs of neighborhoods first and keep foreclosed properties out of the hands of flippers and speculators who perpetuate the cycle of blight and neglect. I listened to city leaders and constituents and made it a priority to see this program through and I will continue to fight for the needs of our community.""
""I am pleased that HUD has agreed to extend Cleveland's landmark REO agreement to the rest of Cuyahoga County,"" said Mayor Frank G. Jackson. ""An agreement with CCLRC takes advantage of their expanded capacity to effectively acquire, hold and dispose of homes in a way that assures quality restoration and supports our neighborhood revitalization efforts.""
Under HUD's agreement, the Department will sell hundreds of foreclosed properties in its inventory at deep discount to the CCLRC. In turn, local governments in the area can accelerate their neighborhood stabilization efforts, especially in areas with high concentrations of foreclosed and abandoned homes.
""We have had very positive discussions with HUD over the last few months. HUD has shown that it is keenly aware of the unique needs in our community, and we very pleased to partner with HUD to address our joint desire to improve neighborhoods in Cuyahoga County,"" said CCLRC President Gus Frangos.
""We will begin working closely with CCLRC on many levels. First, we will inform the Corporation of all our newly acquired properties and then provide initial inspections prior to a public listing. Then we will give CCLRC the exclusive opportunity to purchase these homes for as little at $100,"" explained Engram Lloyd, acting director of HUD's National Homeownership Center.
The discounted sales program being announced today in Cuyahoga County will run until September 30, 2011, at which time HUD and CCLRC will re-assess the success of the program. HUD will offer CCLRC an exclusive opportunity to purchase properties at significantly reduced prices, depending on the home's appraised value. For example:
Homes valued between $20,001 and $100,000 will be sold at a 30 percent discount for an initial five-day period. After 60 days, the homes will be sold at a 50 percent discount. Homes worth up to $20,000 will be sold for $100.
• Homes valued between $20,001 and $100,000 will be sold at a 30 percent discount for an initial five-day period. After 60 days, the homes will be sold at a 50 percent discount.
• Homes worth up to $20,000 will be sold for $100.
Earlier this year, HUD awarded nearly $41 million in NSP2 funds to CCLRC, a consortium that also includes the City of Cleveland, Cuyahoga County, and the Cuyahoga Metropolitan Housing Authority. The funds will be used in targeted areas across 47 census tracts to acquire, rehabilitate, and resell 216 units of foreclosed or abandoned properties and to provide homebuyer loans (such as a soft second mortgage) for these homes and 150 additional homes. In addition, CCLRC plans to demolish 900 homes, deconstruct 95 units so that their components can be reused, and acquire 150 units to be secured and maintained for future purposes. Additionally, 134 rental units will receive developmental assistance specifically for households of 50 percent or less of area median income."

07/07/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-143.cfm,FHA Announces Enhanced Risk Management and Increased Oversight of Multifamily Lenders and Underwriters,"WASHINGTON - As part of the Federal Housing Administration's (FHA) ongoing efforts to enhance risk management practices, Commissioner David H. Stevens today announced plans to implement a series of changes to the multifamily insurance programs that will update underwriting policies, increase lender and underwriter quality, and align loan application, submission and approval standards. FHA's Multifamily Program Office consulted with stakeholders to bring these changes to market.
The policy changes announced today by Mortgage Letter 2010-21 will affect all multifamily rental programs and include the following:
Revised underwriting standards to raise debt service coverage ratios, lower loan to value and loan to cost ratios, increase project reserves and sponsor equity investment, and limit sponsor cash out. Underwriting ratios will be targeted to different property types based on their risk profiles, with lower ratios for subsidized affordable housing properties and higher ratios for market rate properties. Enhanced verification of property financial performance to decrease opportunities for misrepresentation and fraud. Expanded borrower mortgage credit analysis to include a detailed review of contingent liabilities and ballooning term debt that could undermine a sponsor's financial stability. Pre-screening of proposals for early identification of transactions that are not feasible or are not likely to proceed to a commitment, allowing staff to focus on a deeper analysis of transactions that will close.

• Pre-screening of proposals for early identification of transactions that are not feasible or are not likely to proceed to a commitment, allowing staff to focus on a deeper analysis of transactions that will close.
""These are the first updates to our underwriting standards since the inception of FHA's multifamily programs - some of which are over 40 years old,"" said U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Deputy Assistant Secretary Carol Galante. ""These policy changes reflect many of the lending industry's best practices and standards that have evolved in the multifamily market.""
""Today's changes are a much needed step to insure that FHA multifamily programs are sound. These program updates will help us to continue serving our mission of providing liquidity to the multifamily market and decent, affordable rental housing to our nation's communities,"" said Commissioner Stevens.
In addition to the changes outlined in today's mortgagee letter, FHA's multifamily programs will be pursuing additional steps to update agency standards and align the programs with the Obama Administration's broader goals for financial oversight.
Program Changes Expected Through Additional Mortgagee Letters by December 2010:
Heightened standards for lender and underwriter qualifications
All new and existing multifamily lenders and underwriters will undergo an additional screening process to insure that they are qualified and experienced before receiving approval to participate in specialty insurance programs. Under the new policy, a separate approval will be required to offer the agency's more complex insurance programs, such as those for new construction, substantial rehabilitation and Low Income Housing Tax Credits. Results from the Multifamily Accelerated Processing (MAP) program show that these programs demand skilled lenders and underwriters with specialized knowledge. The existing system grants blanket approval to offer the full range of FHA programs without regard to specialized expertise. We anticipate these lender and underwriter qualifications to become effective in Fall 2010.
Update to the Multifamily Accelerated Processing underwriting guide
Originally published in 2000, this underwriting guide establishes all underwriting and processing requirements for the MAP program. The guide will be updated and revised to incorporate all Mortgagee Letters, Housing Notices, and administrative guidance that have been issued since it was first published, along with new chapters on affordable housing underwriting and environmental requirements, and expanded chapters on market studies, commercial income and mortgage credit analysis. HUD is currently revising the MAP Guide to reflect these changes in underwriting standards and will publish the Guide by the end of the calendar year.
Standardization of underwriter's narrative and application file contents
To assure critical analysis of the risks of proposed transactions by MAP underwriters, a standard underwriter's narrative will be used for applications submitted under all insurance programs. Currently, each lender uses its own narrative which leads to uneven and sometimes inadequate analysis of transaction risks. The new policy will also require that a standard table of contents be used to organize application submissions - a simple step toward ensuring consistent and complete presentation of the underwriting materials and to facilitate efficient review of the application package by HUD staff. We anticipate that lenders will be required to use these new forms in Fall 2010.
Loan committee
A new loan committee approval process will align Hub and Program Center commitment authority and practice to ensure consistency in underwriting throughout the regional offices, as well as to provide a platform to share best practices. Loan committees at the Hub and National levels will provide oversight for most transactions in the multifamily insurance program, depending on loan size and a project's number of units. These reviews by the Hub and National loan committees are targeted to commence by the end of July.
Changes Being Pursued by Rule Making Process
Multifamily Credit Watch
In an effort to better align lending practices across FHA programs, an objective, point-based system modeled on that used in the single family program will track multifamily lender performance, material violations of FHA underwriting standards and the rate of loan defaults and claims paid. The current lender monitoring system identifies lender violations but fails to define associated penalties. Under the new monitoring system, each lender's underwriting and loan performance will be compared to that of all other lenders in the MAP program. Based on that review, lenders may be placed on probation, suspended or could have their approval terminated. The new system will enhance FHA's ability to discover and take timely action against lenders that pose unnecessary and unmanageable risk to the insurance fund. It is anticipated that he Multifamily Credit Watch system will be published as a proposed Rule for comment in late summer with final publication scheduled by the end of the calendar year.
In addition to the multifamily program changes announced today, the FHA's overall risk management functions have been strengthened through a number of policy changes made over the last year. The agency's new Chief Risk Officer oversees the coordination of FHA's efforts to focus risk management in a single division devoted solely to managing and mitigating risk to the FHA insurance fund - across all FHA programs. As announced in September 2009, changes to FHA's credit policy focused on ensuring responsible lending and risk management for FHA-approved lenders by ensuring that lenders are adequately capitalized and have a long-term interest in the performance of the loans they originate."
07/07/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-144.cfm,HUD Secretary Donovan Announces $190 Million in Homeless Grants,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan today announced nearly $190 million in new grants to assist hundreds of local homeless assistance programs across the country. The funding will provide support to 550 local projects that will offer critically needed housing and support services to nearly 20,000 homeless individuals and families over the extended lifetime of these grants. For a complete listing of those local programs awarded funding, visit HUD's website.
Last December, HUD awarded nearly $1.4 billion through its Continuum of Care programs to quickly renew funding to 6,445 existing local programs. The grants announced today build on that investment by funding new projects, awarded by competition and funded through the 2009 Continuum of Care funds. In addition, the funding supports the Obama Administration's far-reaching and ambitious plan to end homelessness. Last month, Donovan and 18 other federal agencies unveiled Opening Doors, an unprecedented federal strategy to end veteran and chronic homelessness by 2015, and to end homelessness among children, families, and youth by 2020.
""This funding is an important part of the Obama Administration's new strategy to end homelessness in all its forms,"" said Donovan. ""We know that these programs are critical in moving people beyond a life on the streets and placing them on a path toward dignity and self sufficiency.""
HUD's Continuum of Care grants are awarded competitively to local programs to meet the needs of their homeless clients Continuum of Care grants provide permanent and transitional housing to homeless persons. In addition, Continuum of Care grants fund a wide range of programs including important services such as job training, health care, mental health counseling, substance abuse treatment and child care.. These grants also fund street outreach and assessment programs to transitional and permanent housing for homeless persons and families (see attached summary of the funding awarded today).
HUD's homelessness grants are reducing long-term or chronic homelessness in America. Based on the Department's latest Annual Homeless Assessment Report (AHAR), chronic homelessness has declined by 30 percent since 2006. This decline is directly attributed to HUD's homeless grants helping to create significantly more permanent housing for those who might otherwise be living on the streets. It was also reported in the AHAR that the number of homeless families increased for the second consecutive year, almost certainly due to the ongoing effects of the recession.
In addition to the funding provided through HUD's Continuum of Care Programs, the Department allocated $1.5 billion through its new Homeless Prevention and Rapid Re-housing (HPRP) Program. Made possible through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, HPRP is intended to prevent persons from falling into homelessness or to rapidly re-house them if they do."
07/12/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-145.cfm,FHA Announces First Look Initiative to Help Communities Stabilize Neighborhoods Hard-Hit by Foreclosure,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced a new initiative that gives state and local governments, and nonprofit organizations participating in HUD's Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) preference to acquire homes from the Department's inventory of foreclosed properties, commonly known as ""HUD homes."" The initiative was announced by HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan at the National Council of La Raza annual conference in San Antonio, Texas.
A Notice outlining this temporary initiative will be published this week in the Federal Register. This Notice details how the sale of HUD Homes under the Federal Housing Administration's (FHA's) First Look Sales Method will align NSP and FHA requirements to provide NSP grantees an exclusive option to purchase HUD homes before they are marketed to other purchasers.
""This First Look initiative is a marriage of two programs to accelerate our effort to confront property abandonment in communities struggling to overcome the effects of the foreclosure crisis,"" said Secretary Donovan. ""By essentially giving our NSP grantees a first bite at the apple, we hope to accelerate the sale of FHA's foreclosed properties while supporting the Obama Administration's neighborhood stabilization efforts.""
Through the FHA First Look Sales Method, HUD will offer NSP grantees a preference (""First Look"") to acquire available HUD homes within the defined boundaries of NSP-designated areas. Furthermore, First Look will provide NSP purchasers with the opportunity to purchase FHA properties at a discount of 10 percent below their appraised value, less the cost of any applicable listing and sales commissions.
The FHA-NSP First Look period will last approximately 14 days from the conveyance of a property to FHA. Properties that remain unpurchased at the expiration of the First Look period will be listed and sold according to standard FHA procedures. Eligible NSP grantees may acquire these properties with the assistance of NSP funds for any eligible use under NSP, including rental or homeownership. This sales method becomes effective today and continues through May 31, 2013.
HUD's Neighborhood Stabilization Program was created to address the housing crisis, create jobs, and grow local economies by providing communities with the resources to purchase and rehabilitate vacant homes. NSP grants are helping state and local governments, as well as non-profit developers, acquire land and property; demolish or rehabilitate abandoned properties; and/or offer downpayment and closing cost assistance to low- to middle-income homebuyers. Grantees can also stabilize neighborhoods by creating ""land banks"" to assemble, temporarily manage, and dispose of foreclosed homes.
FHA employs a variety of methods to sell its foreclosed properties in a manner that expands homeownership opportunities, strengthens neighborhoods and communities, and ensures a maximum return to the mortgage insurance fund. Additional information about the sale and purchase of FHA single family properties is available on HUD's website."
07/12/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-146.cfm,Obama Administration Announces More Than $550 Million to Help Very Low-Income Elderly and Persons with Disabilities,"WASHINGTON - Thousands of senior citizens and persons with disabilities will soon be able to find affordable housing, thanks to more than $550 million in housing assistance announced today by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The funding will provide interest-free capital advances to non-profit developers so they can produce accessible housing, offer rental assistance, and provide supportive services for the elderly and persons with disabilities.
The grants announced today are provided through HUD's Section 202 and Section 811 Supporting Housing programs. They will fund 169 projects in 46 states. To read a detailed summary of each grant, visit HUD's website.
""The Obama Administration is committed to making sure our senior citizens and persons with disabilities have opportunities to live in decent, affordable homes,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""Neither of these groups should ever have to worry about being able to find a safe place to live.""
Section 202 Capital Advance ($454.5 million nationwide to assist very low-income elderly)
HUD's Section 202 Capital Advance Program expands the supply of affordable housing with supportive services for the elderly. It provides very low-income elderly persons 62 years of age or older with the opportunity to live independently in an environment that provides support services to frail elderly resident.
In addition to funding the construction, acquisition, and rehabilitation of multifamily developments, HUD's Section 202 program also provides Project Rental Assistance Contract (PRAC) funds to subsidize the rents so that residents only pay 30 percent of their adjusted incomes.
To be eligible for the assistance a household must be classified as ""very low- income,"" which means an income less than 50 percent of the area median. Nationally, based on 50 percent of the national median family income with an applicable adjustment for household size, a one-person household would need to have an income equal to or less than $22,400 a year.
Section 811 Capital Advance ($95.7 million nationwide to assist very low-income with disabilities)
This housing, most of which will be newly constructed, typically is small apartment buildings, group homes for three to four people per home, or condominium units. Residents will pay 30 percent of their adjusted income for rent and the federal government will pay the rest.
Capital advance funds are awarded under HUD's Section 811 program, providing housing for households with one or more very low-income individuals with a disability. Under this program at least one person must be 18 years or older and have a physical or developmental disability or chronic mental illness. The term ""person with disabilities"" also includes two or more people with disabilities living together, and one or more persons with disabilities living with one or more live-in attendants. The program provides persons with disabilities the opportunity to live independently in their communities by increasing the supply of rental housing with the availability of supportive services.
To be classified as ""very low-income,"" a household income cannot exceed 50 percent of the area median income. However, most households that receive Section 811 assistance have an income less than 30 percent of the area median. Generally, this means that a one-person household will have an annual income of about $13,450.
HUD provides the Section 202 and Section 811 funds to non-profit organizations in two forms:
Capital Advances. This is funding that covers the cost of developing, acquiring, or rehabilitating the development. Repayment is not required as long as the housing remains available for occupancy by very low-income elderly persons for at least 40 years for (under Section 202) or very low-income persons with disabilities (under Section 811). Project Rental Assistance Contract (PRAC). This is funding that goes to each development to cover the difference between the residents' contributions toward rent and the HUD-approved cost of operating the project.

07/15/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-147.cfm,HUD to Hold National Fair Housing Policy Conference in New Orleans,"WASHINGTON - Demonstrating the urgency to end housing discrimination, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today announced that it will hold a national fair housing conference in New Orleans, starting Monday, July 19. The five-day conference will feature leading scholars, advocates, government officials, and community leaders focused on providing equal housing opportunities, increasing economic opportunities for low-income individuals, and meeting the needs of persons with disabilities.
Other topics to be discussed will include lending discrimination, combating housing discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons, and creating affordable housing opportunities for residents of New Orleans still rebuilding their lives five years after Hurricane Katrina.
The biennial conference is the first one of the Obama Administration and the ninth in HUD's history. It will take place July 19-23 at the New Orleans Marriott. The theme of the conference, ""Fair Housing 2010: Time to Act,"" reflects the Department's recognition of the urgent need to foster communities where everyone has equal access to housing, transportation, education, and economic opportunities.
""We're making tremendous progress in fair housing but discrimination persists, often in new forms,"" stated John Trasviña, Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""This year's theme, 'Fair Housing 2010: Time to Act,' highlights the urgency to building inclusive, diverse, and sustainable communities, free from discrimination.""

07/15/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-148.cfm,HUD Alleges Ads by Denver Area Condo Association Discriminate Against Families with Children,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has charged a Denver condominium association with violating the Fair Housing Act by discriminating against families with children under the age of 18. According to HUD's charge, Windsor Gardens Association allegedly maintained discriminatory restrictions and published discriminatory statements and advertisements that limited or denied housing to families with children. One statement read: ""Head of household must be 50 years of age; children under the age of 17 are not permitted.""
The Fair Housing Act makes it illegal to print or publish advertisements that indicate a preference or otherwise discriminate against families with children.
""Condo associations that don't meet federal requirements as housing for seniors only don't have the right to turn away families with children,"" said John Trasviña, Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""With the nation's shortage of decent, affordable housing it's even more important that we take action against those who violate the Fair Housing Act.""
HUD's charge is the result of an investigation into Windsor Gardens Association's advertising practices. HUD determined that the association's promotional campaign, as well as its rules and policies, unlawfully restricted resident occupancy to persons age 50 and older and prohibited resident children under the age of 17.
Additionally, another ad read, ""Windsor Gardens, Denver's premier in Town 50+ Community."" The Fair Housing Act prohibits condo associations from discriminating against families with children, unless the housing is exclusively designed for senior citizens. Housing may qualify as housing for older persons if it meets certain requirements, including that 80 percent of the units have at least one resident age 55 or older and that it publishes policies that demonstrate a consistent intent. Windsor Gardens does not meet the federal definition as housing for seniors only.
The HUD charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to the family for its losses and order injunctive relief and other equitable relief to deter further discrimination. In addition, the judge may impose fines in order to vindicate the public interest and award attorney fees. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages to aggrieved persons.
FHEO and its partners in the Fair Housing Assistance Program investigate more than 10,000 housing discrimination complaints annually. People who believe they are the victims of housing discrimination should contact HUD at 1-800-669-9777 (voice), 800-927-9275 (TTY)."
07/15/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-150.cfm,HUD Seeks Public Comment on Three Initiatives to Boost FHA Capital Reserves,"WASHINGTON - Federal Housing Administration (FHA) Commissioner David Stevens today unveiled three specific policy changes to strengthen the FHA's capital reserves while enabling the agency to continue to fulfill its mission to provide access to homeownership for underserved communities. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today published a Notice seeking public comment (http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2010/pdf/2010-17326.pdf) on three specific measures to reduce financial risk and preserve affordable mortgage financing for responsible consumers.
In addition to earlier steps taken to manage its risks and to boost reserves, FHA is proposing to update the combination of credit and down payment requirements for new borrowers; reduce seller concessions from six to three percent; and tighten underwriting standards for manually underwritten mortgage loans.
""These are the latest in a series of changes to allow the FHA to manage its risk better while continuing to support the nation's housing recovery,"" said Stevens. ""By protecting FHA's capital reserves, we can continue providing affordable, responsible mortgage products and will remain the nation's largest source of home purchase financing for underserved communities.""
For the next 30 days, HUD is seeking public comment on the following policy changes, each of which are designed to mitigate risk to the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund while promoting sustainable homeownership for FHA borrowers:
• Update the combination of credit and down payment requirements for new borrowers. New borrowers seeking FHA-insured financing will be required to have a minimum FICO score of 580 to qualify for FHA's flagship 3.5 percent down payment program. New borrowers with credit scores of less than a 580 will be required to make a cash investment of at least 10 percent. Borrowers with credit scores of less than 500 will no longer qualify for an FHA-insured mortgage.
• Reduce allowable seller concessions from six to three percent. Allowing sellers to contribute up to six percent of the home's sales price to offset a buyer's costs exposes the FHA to excess risk by potentially driving up the cost of the home beyond its appraised value. Reducing seller concessions to three percent will bring FHA into conformity with industry standards.
• Tighten underwriting standards for manually underwritten loans. When using compensating factors in the underwriting process, lenders will be required to consider those factors which are the best predictive indicators of loan performance, such as the borrower's credit history, loan-to-value (LTV) percentage, debt-to income ratio, and cash reserves."

The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to retaliate against individuals because they exercised their fair housing rights.
""HUD will not tolerate retaliation against individuals who file discrimination complaints,"" stated John Trasviña, Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Discrimination victims are not alone when exerting their rights under the Fair Housing Act.""
In November 2008, the mother of three filed a housing discrimination complaint against Cedar Rapids landlord Robert Miell alleging that he refused to rent her a three-bedroom apartment and unjustly charged her a higher security deposit because of her sex. HUD found no evidence of sex discrimination, but charged the landlord and management company in September 2009 with unlawfully retaliating against the tenant by terminating her lease and attempting to evict her because she filed a housing discrimination complaint.
An Administrative Law Judge awarded the tenant and her family $20,150 in damages and assessed a total civil penalty of $32,000 against the landlord and his management corporation.
HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity and its partners in the Fair Housing Assistance Program investigate more than 10,000 housing discrimination complaints annually.

07/16/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-151.cfm,"HUD Retains Gilmore Kean, LLC to Lead New Orleans Housing Authority","WASHINGTON - After conducting a competitive national search for a long-term administrator to lead the Housing Authority of New Orleans (HANO), the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced today that the current receivership team, Gilmore Kean, LLC will continue to lead the agency from recovery to revitalization over the next three years.
""In less than a year, David Gilmore and his team have done a tremendous job stabilizing and strengthening operations at HANO,"" said HUD Assistant Secretary Sandra Henriquez. ""Hands down, we feel this team is the most qualified candidate for this assignment.""
""We are honored that HUD chose us to perform this crucial task and we are confident that we can turn HANO from a troubled agency to one that other housing authorities will emulate,"" said Gilmore. ""The people of New Orleans deserve a housing authority they can be proud of and we will give them one that will provide better housing, services and quality of life for them.""
Last fall, Gilmore Kean, LLC, was selected to manage day-to-day operations and conduct a comprehensive audit of the agency that will serve as the roadmap for developing and implementing a long-term recovery strategy for returning the agency to local control.
Since that time, the team has moved quickly to resolve several critically important financial, human resource and redevelopment challenges. For example, HANO submitted a clean FY 2009 audit to the State of Louisiana on-time for the first time in several years. Gilmore Keane was also instrumental in restructuring HANO's Housing Choice Voucher Program - allowing the agency to process more than 2,400 new vouchers over the past 90 days. The team also implemented the first multi-agency partnership with social service agencies to administer vouchers for families with preferences.
In addition, Gilmore Kean, LLC ensued that HANO fully obligated the $34.5 million in funding received through President Obama's American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009. In addition, Gilmore Kean, LLC maintains a zero-tolerance policy for unethical and illegal behavior by HANO employees and takes immediate action when problems are discovered.
The team is also actively engaged in the redevelopments of 'The Big Four' public housing developments, making considerable progress toward building new homes and communities for families. In April, HANO opened units at Columbia Parc, formerly St. Bernard, and Harmony Oaks, formerly C.J. Peete. Earlier this year, Gilmore Kean and HUD worked closely with Providence/Enterprise, the Lafitte developer, to accelerate the number of affordable public housing units built in the first phase of development. In February, [David] Gilmore approved a $10.5 million loan from HANO to jump-start vertical construction at Lafitte. While the extension of the GO-ZONE tax credits remain an issue, Gilmore and his development team are working closely with B.W. Cooper developer KBK Enterprises to ensure they move forward, as close to the plan as possible, and in a timely manner."

In addition, for the first time, the report now tracks the impact of HUD's Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP), which has spurred local investment and is beginning to make affordably-priced homes available to consumers. The Housing Scorecard is the Administration's comprehensive report on the nation's housing market.
""The housing market is performing better than the predictions made over a year ago,"" said HUD Assistant Secretary Raphael Bostic. ""We're absolutely not claiming victory, but due to the Obama Administration's efforts, improved home affordability is continuing to provide opportunities for prospective, qualified, homebuyers, while promising neighborhood stabilization efforts are helping hard hit neighborhoods start to recover.""
""The Administration's programs to stabilize the housing market have helped many across the country weather this crisis,"" said Treasury Assistant Secretary Herb Allison. ""Our initiatives continue to offer responsible homeowners the chance to avoid the often painful process of foreclosure.""
The July Housing Scorecard features key data on the health of the housing market including:
Historic low rates continue to promote affordability: Families continue to benefit from the lowest rates in history on 30-year fixed mortgages. Since April of 2009, record low rates have helped more than 7.2 million homeowners to refinance, resulting in more stable home prices and $12.9 billion in total borrower savings. Over twice as many homeowners helped compared to foreclosure completions: Nearly three million borrowers have received restructured mortgages since April 2009, outpacing the 1.24 million foreclosure completions for the same period. As more families are able to remain in their homes, household assets continue to rise with $1.1 trillion in home equity gained since April 2009. Tracking the impact of HUD's Neighborhood Stabilization Program, a $6 billion effort - including $2 billion in Recovery Act funds - that is helping local jurisdictions address the foreclosure crisis by allowing grantees to acquire foreclosed homes and repair, redevelop, rent or sell them to low and moderate income households. Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) permanent modifications are on pace and sustainable for the homeowner, as more than 50,000 trial agreements graduated to permanent in June and default rates remain low: Growth in permanent modifications have averaged more than 50,000 per month over the last six months. For HAMP permanent modifications in place six months, less than 6 percent are 60+ days delinquent, and the default rate (90+ days delinquent) is less than 2 percent. [Since the July 20th release of the HAMP report, program administrator Fannie Mae has reported an issue in its reporting of permanent modification performance. Fannie Mae is revising the data and Treasury has retained a third-party consultant to provide additional review and independent validation. The update will be available at http://www.financialstability.gov/latest/reportsanddocs.html.] New HAMP Metrics for Servicer Compliance: This month, the report includes a new dashboard to help officials monitor homeowner experience. This dashboard includes timetables for full implementation of the Home Affordable Foreclosures Alternative Program (HAFA) and the Second Lien Modification Program (2MP). New measures include time to answer incoming calls, time to resolve complaints and outcomes for homeowners not eligible for a HAMP modification or unable to convert to a permanent modification. While cancellations remain high as many borrowers who received temporary modifications were not able to meet eligibility requirements such as verifying their income or successfully making trial payments, servicers report that close to 50 percent of homeowners not offered a HAMP permanent modification are offered a proprietary modification or are able to bring their loan current. Fewer than 2 percent have gone to foreclosure sale and fewer than 10 percent have entered the foreclosure process.

Meanwhile, data in the scorecard show that the recovery of the housing market remains fragile, with some measures suggesting recovery will take place over time. For example, in May, sales of new and existing sales dropped after the expiration of the tax credit, and the supply of homes on and off the market remains near all-time highs; it will take time to work through this large inventory.
Issued monthly by HUD and Treasury, the Housing Scorecard incorporates key housing market indicators and highlights the impact of the Administration's unprecedented housing recovery efforts, including assistance to homeowners through the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and HAMP.

07/21/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-154.cfm,HUD Charges Ohio Landlords with Discriminating Against Hispanic Woman,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced that it has charged two Cleveland-area landlords with violating the Fair Housing Act for allegedly refusing to rent a house to a woman because she is Hispanic. Furthermore, HUD contends that Kathy Parker and Deryl Gibson, the African- American owners of the Warrensville, Ohio, house asked the woman, ""Why do you want to live in a black neighborhood,"" and informed her that she might not feel comfortable there.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing discrimination based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, and disability, including discouraging a person from living in a neighborhood.
""A property owner, and in this case a real estate agent, does not have the right to deny housing to a person because of their race or where they come from,"" stated John Trasviña, Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""When they do it is unacceptable and unlawful. The Fair Housing Act guarantees equal housing opportunities for all and HUD is committed to enforcing the law.""
According to HUD's charge, the Hispanic woman and fair housing tester each attempted to rent a three-bedroom house owned by Parker, who is a licensed real estate agent, and Gibson. When Parker showed the Hispanic tester the home, Parker asked the woman why she wanted to live in a black neighborhood and remarked that it was not a good idea. After the woman expressed her interest in renting the house, Parker allegedly told her that she would have to consider it while she continued to show the house to other prospective renters.
During HUD's investigation, Parker told the investigator that she had ""problems"" with races other than African American when the dominate race of the community is black. The house was eventually rented to an African-American family.
The HUD charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to aggrieved persons for the damages caused them by the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief to deter further discrimination, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose fines in order to vindicate the public interest. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages to aggrieved persons.
FHEO and its partners in the Fair Housing Assistance Program investigate more than 10,000 housing discrimination complaints annually. People who believe they are the victims of housing discrimination should contact HUD at 1-800-669-9777 (voice), 800-927-9275 (TTY)."
07/21/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-155.cfm,HUD and Florida Management Companies Reach Agreement to Improve and Increase Housing Opportunities for Families,"WASHINGTON - Families with children are now able to live without restrictions at a Pompano Beach, Florida housing development under a voluntary agreement between the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Cornerstone Residential Management, Inc., and the Oaks at Pompano, Ltd. The agreement will improve and increase the affordability of multifamily housing in their area and provide $30,000 in rental assistance to families with children. The firms will also make family-friendly improvements to their properties and donate $20,000 to a fair housing organization. To read the full text of the agreement, visit HUD's website.
The agreement comes after a June 2008 HUD review of occupancy restrictions set forth by the management group at the Oaks at Pompano, an apartment complex in Pompano Beach, Florida, that leases one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments. HUD discovered that the restrictions not only forced families to pay more for their dwelling, but also denied families tenancy. The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing discrimination based on family status, including actions that unreasonably limit rental occupancy.
""This settlement takes significant steps to further fair housing, make units available to families, and promote a positive living environment,"" said John Trasviña, Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (FHEO). ""Ensuring fair housing for all at the local level has a significant national impact.""
Under the terms of the agreement, the management companies will:
Provide families with children $30,000 in rental incentives or discounts on their rental amounts at the Oaks at Pompano; Use $20,000 to make family-friendly improvements to the Oaks at Pompano; Adjust occupancy standards so that one-bedroom units house two people, two-bedroom units house four people and three-bedroom units house six people; Donate $20,000 to a local fair housing organization(s); and Provide and verify fair housing training to staff at Oaks at Pompano and all other properties.
• Provide families with children $30,000 in rental incentives or discounts on their rental amounts at the Oaks at Pompano;
• Use $20,000 to make family-friendly improvements to the Oaks at Pompano;
• Adjust occupancy standards so that one-bedroom units house two people, two-bedroom units house four people and three-bedroom units house six people;
• Donate $20,000 to a local fair housing organization(s); and

07/21/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-158.cfm,HUD to Investigate Mortgage Lenders Who Discriminate Against Expectant Mothers and New Parents,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced today that it will launch multiple investigations into the lending practices of certain mortgage lenders to determine if they illegally denied families mortgages because the mother is pregnant or a family member is experiencing a short-term disability. The action follows a report published this week in the New York Times outlining the lending practices of some lenders which might possibly violate the Fair Housing Act.
""Denying a mortgage to people just because they're having a baby is flat wrong,"" said Vice President Biden, Chair of the White House Task Force on Middle Class Families. ""Mothers on maternity leave have jobs, they have income, and they shouldn't have to lose their deal to close on a house because they had a baby. I applaud HUD for taking action on this practice that could potentially affect untold numbers of families.""
HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan said, ""Lenders have every right to ascertain the incomes of families to determine whether they are eligible for a mortgage loan but they have no right to use a pregnancy or a short-term disability as a cause to deny that family a mortgage they would otherwise qualify for. Having a child should be a time for a family to celebrate and must not be a cause for unfair lending practices.""
HUD enforces the Fair Housing Act which prohibits discrimination in lending based on sex, familial status (pregnancy or children in the family), or disability. The Act protects consumers from being discriminated against based on a borrower's maternity leave if the borrower can demonstrate that she intends to return to work and can otherwise continue to meet the income requirements to qualify for the loan.
A published report in the New York Times indicated that some mortgage lenders may be denying credit to borrowers because of a pregnancy or maternity leave. As a result, HUD's Office of Fair Housing Equal Opportunity is opening multiple investigations into the practices of lending institutions to determine if they are violating the Fair Housing Act.
""This report is profoundly disturbing and requires immediate action,"" said John Trasviña, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, the office that will be directing these investigations. ""Lenders must not carry out due diligence responsibilities in ways that have the practical effect of discriminating against recent or expectant mothers.""
HUD's Federal Housing Administration (FHA) requires its approved lenders to review a borrower's income to determine whether they can reasonably be expected to continue paying their mortgage for the first three years of the loan. FHA-insured lenders cannot, however, inquire about future maternity leave. If a borrower is on maternity or short-term disability leave at the time of closing, lenders must document the borrower's intent to return to work, that the borrower has the right to return to work, and that the borrower qualifies for the loan taking into account any reduction of income due to their leave. Meanwhile, HUD is currently reviewing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's underwriting guidelines to determine if they satisfy the Fair Housing Act, including income verification of persons taking parental or disability leave."
07/22/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-157.cfm,HUD and VA Launch $15 Million Demonstration Program to Prevent Veteran Homelessness,"WASHINGTON - In an effort to prevent homelessness among veterans, primarily those returning from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) today announced that both agencies will invest a combined $15 million in five selected communities near military installations. The HUD and VA grant funding is intended to provide housing assistance and supportive services to veterans who might otherwise be living in homeless shelters or on the streets.
Under the new Veterans Homelessness Prevention Demonstration Program (VHPD), existing HUD grantees or 'Continuums of Care' located near the following military installations will each receive $2 million: MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida; Camp Pendleton in San Diego, California; Fort Hood in Killeen, Texas; Fort Drum in Watertown, New York; and Joint Base Lewis-McChord near Tacoma, Washington. In addition, VA medical centers in the following areas will each receive $1 million: Tampa, San Diego, Dallas, Syracuse, New York, and American Lake in Washington.
""The men and women who serve our nation deserve better than a life on the streets when they return home,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""These grants represent a first step toward designing the best interventions possible so that we can prevent homelessness for those heroes who sacrificed so much for us. It is also another step forward toward reaching President Obama's goal of preventing and ending homelessness in all its forms.""
VA Secretary Eric K. Shinseki added, ""While usually the strongest and most resilient of Americans, Veterans still represent a disproportionate share of America's jobless, homeless, depressed, substance abusers, and suicides. Nowhere is our obligation to our citizens, and to our Veterans who have defended our Nation, more important, more visible, or more necessary than in our commitment to prevent and end homelessness.""
""This effort is about reaching veterans and their families who are transitioning home and struggling to readjust,"" said Senator Patty Murray, who established VHPD in the Fiscal Year 2009 Housing Appropriations bill. ""By providing access to stable housing, health care, and job training and outreach services this program provides targeted support to our heroes who are returning home to a difficult economic climate. All veterans deserve housing and the dignity that comes with it and this is another step to reach those who have sacrificed so much.""
Through this combination of housing, health care and employment services provided through the U.S. Department of Labor, VHPD is designed to explore innovative early interventions to help prevent veteran homelessness, targeted to service members returning from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.
The three-year grants announced today will help the five identified communities or Continuums of Care to use and track client-level data provided by the VA and U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) to target veterans who meet the eligibility criteria. VA will act as the primary liaison to the grantee and will provide eligible Veterans with access to VA health care and benefits. HUD funds will provide short- or medium-term rental assistance, including security deposits, utility payments and case management. In addition, the program will offer community-based supportive services appropriate for veterans and their families, including child care and family services.
VHPD is also intended to improve the understanding of the unique needs of veterans returning from Afghanistan and Iraq. HUD anticipates that it will take approximately ninety (90) days from the date these grant agreements are signed for selected grantees to be able to identify and serve veteran individuals and/or families who qualify for assistance under VHPD.
VHPD also supports the Obama Administration's far-reaching and ambitious strategic plan to prevent and end homelessness. Last month, HUD and 18 other federal agencies unveiled Opening Doors, an unprecedented federal strategy to end veteran and chronic homelessness by 2015, and to end homelessness among children, families, and youth by 2020."

The report, which covers the last full fiscal year of HUD's complaint investigations and fair housing activities, was released during HUD's National Fair Housing Policy Conference in New Orleans. The report shows that discrimination based on a person's disability status continues to account for the largest-single category of complaints. Of the 10,242 complaints filed with HUD and its fair housing partners during fiscal year 2009, 44 percent alleged disability discrimination, while 31 percent alleged discrimination based on race, and 20 percent based on family status. The number and type of complaints received are consistent with the previous two years.
""Despite much progress and hard work, Americans continue to face housing discrimination because they're in a wheelchair, are a different color, or background, or have children,"" stated John Trasviña, Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""This report is a stark reminder that HUD and our fair housing partners must redouble our commitment to end housing discrimination.""
This year's report highlights HUD's enforcement efforts, including those that led to changes of policies and equal housing opportunities for racial and ethnic minorities, persons with disabilities, and others. The Department also handled an array of discrimination cases that resulted in compensation for the victims or pertained to families with children. For example:
HUD charged two Tallassee, AL, landlords with violating the Fair Housing Act for allegedly forcing a white family to move out of the house they rented to them after the landlords saw the family talking with African-American neighbors in their front yard. Three months after charging the case, HUD obtained a settlement that required the landlords to pay the African-American family $63,000. HUD charged a Puerto Rico condominium association with violating the Fair Housing Act for denying a disabled couple the use of two handicap accessible parking spaces. A HUD Administrative Law Judge subsequently ordered the association to pay $25,000 in damages to the couple, and $10,000 in civil penalties for violating the couple's fair housing rights. HUD charged an Atlanta condominium association and a local real estate company and its agent with discrimination for refusing to sell to families with children. The agent advertised a unit and conditioned the sale to those without children. During HUD's investigation, the agent admitted that several prospective buyers with children younger than 14 inquired about the unit and were told about the restriction. In addition, the report highlights HUD's efforts to ensure that the agency's core housing programs are open to all, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. Last month, HUD announced that it will now require all applicants for Fiscal Year 2010 grant funding to certify that they have not been charged with a systemic violation of state or local laws that are equivalent to the Fair Housing Act based on a person's lesbian, bisexual, gay, and transgender status.

07/26/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-159.cfm,"HUD Charges Chicago Architect, Developer with Failure to Build Apartments that are Accessible to Persons with Disabilities","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced that it is charging a Chicago developer and architect with housing discrimination for designing and constructing apartments that fail to meet the accessibility requirements of the Fair Housing Act. HUD's charge contends that Hector Castillo, Hector Castillo Architects, Inc., and 914 W. Hubbard, Inc. is inaccessible to persons with disabilities in several ways, including having doorways that are too narrow, and kitchens and bathrooms that do not contain adequate maneuvering space.
The Fair Housing Act requires that multifamily housing built for first occupancy after March 13, 1991 contain accessible features for persons with disabilities. Requirements include accessible common areas, bathrooms and kitchens, as well as wider doors and environmental controls that can be reached by persons who use wheelchairs. The failure to include these features violates the Fair Housing Act and makes the property difficult or impossible to use by persons with disabilities.
HUD files this charge on the 20th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act.
""Architects, builders and developers have had legal responsibilities under the Fair Housing Act for over two decades. HUD will enforce the law to create more housing opportunities for people with disabilities,"" said John Trasviña, Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""The joint goals of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Fair Housing Act--to provide access at home, at work, and in public--are unmet if public areas are accessible but homes are not.""
HUD's complaint, which was filed by the Assistant Secretary, was based on information provided by Access Living of Metropolitan Chicago, a non-profit disability advocacy organization. Access Living was retained by the Illinois Department of Human Rights to test 914 W. Hubbard for accessibility. The tester, who uses a wheelchair, found that he was unable to pass through a number of doors, and had difficulty maneuvering in the kitchens and bathrooms, among other things.
The HUD charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, s/he may award damages to aggrieved persons for their losses and order injunctive relief and other equitable relief to deter further discrimination. In addition, the judge may impose fines in order to vindicate the public interest and award attorney fees. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages to aggrieved persons.
FHEO and its partners in the Fair Housing Assistance Program investigate more than 10,000 housing discrimination complaints annually. People who believe they are the victims of housing discrimination should contact HUD at 1-800-669-9777 (voice), 800-927-9275 (TTY)."

This year alone, the MRB took nearly 1,500 administrative sanctions against lenders, including reprimands, probations, suspensions, withdrawals of approval, and civil money penalties.
""Lenders should know by now that FHA will not tolerate fraudulent or predatory lending practices,"" said FHA Commissioner David Stevens. ""Any FHA-approved lender that does business with us must follow our standards. If we determine that our partners are not playing by the rules, we will take action - it's that simple.""
FHA's Mortgagee Review Board sanctions FHA-approved lenders for violations of the agency's program requirements. For serious violations, the Board can withdraw a lender's FHA approval so that the lender cannot participate in FHA programs. In less serious cases, the Board enters into settlement agreements with lenders to bring them into compliance. The Board can also impose civil money penalties, probation, suspension, and issue letters of reprimand.

These events, which will include a major conference in Washington, D.C., will help provide critical public input as the Administration continues its work developing a comprehensive housing finance reform proposal for delivery to Congress by January 2011.
""The future of our housing finance system is critical not only to our economic recovery, but also to millions of American homeowners in every corner of our country,"" said Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner. ""Now is the time to build on the foundation we laid with the historic Wall Street Reform legislation President Obama signed last week and aggressively move forward to improve our nation's housing finance system. The Obama Administration is committed to delivering a comprehensive reform proposal that protects taxpayers, institutes tough oversight, restores the long-term health of our housing market, and strengthens our nation's economic recovery.""
""The Obama Administration is committed to engaging stakeholders and the public as we consider proposals for reforming the housing finance system,"" said U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""The need for reform is clear and we want to listen to a wide range of views as we chart a course to a more robust and stable housing market that works for the benefit of the American people.""
In the months ahead, the Administration will continue to gather input from a broad cross-section of stakeholders through a variety of events. On August 17, the Obama Administration will host a Conference on the Future of Housing Finance in Washington D.C. at the Treasury Department. This event will bring together leading academic experts, consumer and community organizations, industry groups, market participants, and other stakeholders for an open discussion about housing finance reform.
The Obama Administration has already begun the work of developing proposals for reforming our nation's system of housing finance. In early 2010, Secretaries Geithner and Donovan delivered testimony before Congress on the Obama Administration's ongoing work in this area, and the broad principles that would guide those efforts.
In April 2010, Treasury and HUD issued a set of questions for public comment on the future of the housing finance system, which received more than 300 responses from a broad cross-section of consumer groups, industry groups, market participants, members of the public, think tanks, and other stakeholders.

07/27/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-165.cfm,Obama Administration Awards $19.5 Million to Produce More Assisted Living Senior Housing in Four States,"WASHINGTON - Elderly Americans in Arizona, Maryland, New York and Ohio will soon find themselves living in upgraded apartments equipped to meet their physical needs because of $19.5 million in grants from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. HUD today announced the grants to help convert existing multifamily projects into assisted living facility for the elderly. A detailed summary of each grant is attached to this release.
The funding is provided through HUD's Assisted Living Conversion Program which provides grants for the physical conversion of eligible multifamily assisted housing projects or portions of projects to assisted living facilities.
""These grants will provide an affordable option to nursing homes, helping seniors to live independently,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""The funding we announce today will allow the elderly an opportunity to age in place in familiar surroundings as they become older and require supportive services.""
Assisted living facilities are designed to accommodate low-income frail elderly persons and persons with disabilities who can live independently but need assistance with the activities of daily living such as help with eating, bathing, grooming, dressing and home management activities. These affordable facilities provide support services such as personal care, transportation, meals, and housekeeping.
The grants are awarded on a competitive basis. During the review process, HUD assesses several ranking factors including: the extent to which the conversion is needed by the persons that the project is intended to serve; the quality and effectiveness of the proposal in addressing the proposed conversion including the meals and supportive services which the project intends to provide; the ability of the project owner to secure other community resources which can be combined with the grant to achieve the program's purposes; and the capacity of the project owner to carry out the conversion in a timely and effective manner.
The owners are responsible for ensuring that converted units meet all local standards, codes and regulations governing assisted living facilities. The projects must also be licensed and regulated by the appropriate governing body."

The PSAs direct homeowners to visit MakingHomeAffordable.gov or call 1-888-995-HOPE (4673) to see if they may be eligible for assistance to make their mortgage payments more affordable and to understand options they may have to avoid foreclosure.
Created pro bono by The Kaplan Thaler Group, a New York-based advertising agency, the new campaign is available in English and Spanish and features real homeowners from across the country who have benefited from the program.
""Even though the economy is getting stronger, many Americans are still facing the fear and uncertainty of losing their home to foreclosure,"" said Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner. ""The Administration's loan modification programs have given more than a million responsible homeowners a chance to stay in their homes, and we want to do all we can to help make sure that struggling homeowners know about these free resources for help.""
""Many responsible borrowers continue to face challenges due to unemployment, negative equity or because of soaring utility payments,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""These public service announcements will help us to reach at-risk borrowers now, while they are still current on their payments and eligible to receive help through the Making Home Affordable Program or our expanded options for Federal Housing Administration (FHA) refinancing.""
""We are proud to partner with the Treasury and HUD on this critical campaign to educate Americans about free resources available to help them prevent foreclosures,"" said Peggy Conlon, President and CEO, the Ad Council. ""We hope Americans who are struggling will be empowered by these compelling PSAs and take simple actions to help them stay in their homes.""
The Ad Council will distribute the new PSAs to more than 33,000 media outlets nationwide. The campaign includes television, radio, print, out of home and web advertising. The PSAs will air in advertising space donated by the media.
The Making Home Affordable Program was launched in February 2009 to help homeowners who are at risk of foreclosure through no fault of their own make their monthly mortgage payments more affordable. Since then, more than 1.5 million homeowners have been offered help under the program, and almost 1.3 million homeowners have started a trial plan. Homeowners in permanent modifications under the program have a median monthly savings of over $500 each month or about one-third of their previous payment.
Any homeowner who is struggling with their mortgage is encouraged to visit MakingHomeAffordable.gov or call 1-888-995-HOPE (4673) to learn about options they may have and to speak with a HUD-approved housing counselor for free.

About Neighborhood Networks
HUD's Office of Multifamily Housing Programs created Neighborhood Networks in September 1995. The community-based Initiative was one of the first federal initiatives to promote self-sufficiency for low- and moderate-income persons. Through Neighborhood Networks, HUD encourages property owners and managers of FHA-insured and -assisted housing to establish and maintain onsite Neighborhood Networks centers. HUD's intent is to increase residents' self-sufficiency by delivering computer access and a variety of workforce development programs. Today, 15 years later, Neighborhood Networks continues to have a positive and lasting impact on families and communities across the country."
08/03/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-170.cfm,HUD Official Joins Anchorage Mayor to Open New Senior Housing,"ANCHORAGE, AK - U.S. Housing and Urban Development Assistant Secretary Sandra B. Henriquez joined Anchorage Mayor Dan Sullivan today to celebrate the grand opening of Eklutna Estates, the newest senior housing development of the Cook Inlet Housing Authority (CIHA). The housing authority used $3.2 million of the $5.7 million it received from the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to construct the new housing.
""I commend CIHA for successfully leveraging HUD support, including Recovery Act money and its annual Indian Housing Block Grants, to build vital affordable housing for the elderly in this community,"" said Henriquez, who is on a week-long Alaskan tour. ""In addition to providing much needed housing for this population, the housing authority and its partners on this project have also strengthened the local economy by putting people in this region to work.""
Joining Henriquez and Sullivan was Susanne Fleek of U.S. Senator Mark Begich's office and the CEO/President of the Cook Inlet Housing Authority Carol Gore. Eklutna Estates consists of 59 apartments - 46 one-bedroom/one-bath units and 13 two-bedroom/two-bath units and is open to Alaskans aged 55 and older. The new facility is located within CIHA's existing senior community, Centennial Village, in east Anchorage.
Henriquez is in Alaska this week getting a look at how HUD funding is making a difference in the lives of Native Americans and Alaska Natives and meeting with tribal entities that are engaging in partnerships to create innovative, sustainable, affordable housing. Also traveling with Henriquez is Rodger Boyd, Deputy Assistant Secretary of HUD's Office of Native American Programs.
""We are very pleased that Assistant Secretary Henriquez is visiting Alaska this week, particularly since she will have an opportunity to visit a number of the communities we serve and meet with many of partners with whom we work,"" said HUD Northwest Regional Administrator Mary McBride. ""Alaska is our nation's biggest state and faces some of the biggest challenges and opportunities. The Assistant Secretary's visit will give her a first-hand understanding of the resources and programs HUD offers to continue progress for the state and its residents.""
In addition to the groundbreaking, earlier today Henriquez toured the Mountain View community, which has made a remarkable comeback after a decade of decline. HUD's more than $15 million investment in Mountain View, through Community Development Block Grants, HOME Investment Partnerships Program, Neighborhood Stabilization and economic development funding, has been leveraged with public and private support to create affordable housing, a library, job creation, a recreation center and the Alaska Museum of Natural History.
Henriquez will also meet with Executive Director of the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation (AHFC) Dan Fauske and members of his team today. AHFC has been a significant force in ensuring Alaskans have access to safe, decent, affordable housing.
Later in the week, Henriquez will travel to Barrow to meet with officials at Illisagvik College and the Tagiugmiullu Nunamiullu Housing Authority, who have partnered with the University of Alaska at Fairbanks and the Cold Climate Housing Research Center (CCHRC), located on the University's campus. Since HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan's visit to Alaska in the Spring of 2009, HUD's Anchorage Field Office, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and other Federal agencies in Alaska have been working with native villages and CCHRC to identify ways that Federal agencies can promote the development of housing units and products more sustainable in and suitable for Alaska's Arctic and sub-Arctic climates.
Henriquez will end her Alaskan tour in Fairbanks meeting with members of the Association of Alaska Housing Authorities and tour and meet with officials of the CCHRC."

On Tuesday, President Obama issued a disaster declaration for Cameron, Hidalgo, Jim Hogg, Maverick, Starr, Val Verde, Webb, and Zapata Counties. The President's declaration allows HUD to offer foreclosure relief and other assistance to certain families living in this county.
""Families who may have been forced from their homes need to know that help is available to begin the rebuilding process,"" said Donovan. ""Whether it's foreclosure relief for FHA-insured families or helping these counties to recover, HUD stands ready to help in any way we can.""
HUD is:
Offering the State of Texas the ability to re-allocate existing federal resources toward disaster relief - HUD's Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and HOME programs give the State the flexibility to redirect millions of dollars to address critical needs, including housing and services for flood victims. HUD is currently contacting State and local officials to explore streamlining the Department's CDBG and HOME programs in order to expedite the repair and replacement of damaged housing; Granting immediate foreclosure relief - HUD granted a 90-day moratorium on foreclosures and forbearance on foreclosures of Federal Housing Administration (FHA)-insured home mortgages; Making mortgage insurance available - HUD's Section 203(h) program provides FHA insurance to disaster victims who have lost their homes and are facing the daunting task of rebuilding or buying another home.

08/05/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-171.cfm,"HUD Provides Rental Assistance Vouchers to Help More Than 2,500 Families Stay Together","WASHINGTON - Across the U.S., thousands of children live in foster care or are at risk of being placed with other families simply because their parents cannot afford a home. Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced $20 million in funding to local housing authorities to help more than 2,500 families stay together. It's estimated that the rental vouchers awarded today will reunite nearly 5,000 children with their parents or prevent them from entering foster care in the first place. (See attached chart here).
""The foster care system is an important safety net for children when there's no alternative, but not having the means to obtain affordable housing is hardly a good reason for families to be divided,"" said U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""Thankfully these vouchers will keep thousands of families together under one roof.""
HUD's Family Unification Program (FUP) will make 2,543 Housing Choice Vouchers available for families whose inadequate housing is the primary cause of their separation or near separation from their children. In addition, 20 percent of these vouchers will provide stable housing for approximately 750 young adults (ages 18-22) who are aging out of the foster care system, preventing them from becoming homelessness.
The funding is awarded to local public housing authorities that work closely with local child welfare agencies to identify families with children in foster care or who are at risk of being placed in foster care and youth at risk of homelessness. These vouchers, like regular Housing Choice Vouchers, allow families to rent housing from private landlords and generally pay 30 percent of the family's monthly adjusted gross income towards rent and utilities.
According to the National Center for Housing and Child Welfare, the average annual cost of providing foster care for one family's children is $56,892. By contrast, it costs approximately $13,193 a year to provide rental assistance and supportive services for that same family. Since FUP provides affordable housing to this targeted population, it's estimated that the total yearly savings to the foster care system is more than $142 million. Cost savings are also considerable for young people aging out of foster care. The average annual FUP costs for young adults is $5,600 - a tenth of the estimated costs associated with homelessness, incarceration, and residential treatment.
""The Family Unification Program exemplifies Secretary Donovan's commitment to interagency coordination and resource sharing,"" said Ruth White, Executive Director of NCHCW. ""FUP will enable housing and social service providers to work together to apply resources where they are most needed to prevent and end homelessness for thousands of children and youth nationwide - and ultimately save money along the way.""
The funds announced today include $5.4 million HUD awarded earlier this year to housing authorities in California, Delaware, Florida, Massachusetts, Illinois and Washington. Those housing authorities submitted applications that were eligible for funding last year but did not receive funding because all available funds were exhausted. Those housing authorities are: Stanislaus (CA) Housing Authority; Santa Barbara (CA) Housing Authority; Alameda (CA) Housing Authority; Kern (CA) Housing Authority, Santa Clara County (CA) Housing Authority; Sonoma County (CA) Community Development Commission; Delaware State Housing Authority; Lee County (FL) Housing Authority; DuPage (IL) Housing Authority; Lynn (MA) Housing Authority and Neighborhood Development; and the Housing Authority of the City of Vancouver (WA)."
08/06/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-173.cfm,FHA Launches Short Refi Opportunity for Underwater Homeowners,"WASHINGTON - In an effort to help responsible homeowners who owe more on their mortgage than the value of their property, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today provided details on the adjustment to its refinance program which was announced earlier this year that will enable lenders to provide additional refinancing options to homeowners who owe more than their home is worth. Starting September 7, 2010, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) will offer certain 'underwater' non-FHA borrowers who are current on their existing mortgage and whose lenders agree to write off at least ten percent of the unpaid principal balance of the first mortgage, the opportunity to qualify for a new FHA-insured mortgage.
The FHA Short Refinance option is targeted to help people who owe more on their mortgage than their home is worth - or 'underwater' - because their local markets saw large declines in home values. Originally announced in March, these changes and other programs that have been put in place will help the Administration meet its goal of stabilizing housing markets by offering a second chance to up to 3 to 4 million struggling homeowners through the end of 2012.
""We're throwing a life line out to those families who are current on their mortgage and are experiencing financial hardships because property values in their community have declined,"" said FHA Commissioner David H. Stevens. ""This is another tool to help overcome the negative equity problem facing many responsible homeowners who are looking to refinance into a safer, more secure mortgage product.""
Today, FHA published a mortgagee letter to provide guidance to lenders on how to implement this new enhancement. Participation in FHA's refinance program is voluntary and requires the consent of all lien holders. To be eligible for a new loan, the homeowner must owe more on their mortgage than their home is worth and be current on their existing mortgage. The homeowner must qualify for the new loan under standard FHA underwriting requirements and have a credit score equal to or greater than 500. The property must be the homeowner's primary residence. And the borrower's existing first lien holder must agree to write off at least 10% of their unpaid principal balance, bringing that borrower's combined loan-to-value ratio to no greater than 115%.
In addition, the existing loan to be refinanced must not be an FHA-insured loan, and the refinanced FHA-insured first mortgage must have a loan-to-value ratio of no more than 97.75 percent. Interested homeowners should contact their lenders to determine if they are eligible and whether the lender agrees the write down a portion of the unpaid principal.
To facilitate the refinancing of new FHA-insured loans under this program, the U.S. Department of Treasury will provide incentives to existing second lien holders who agree to full or partial extinguishment of the liens. To be eligible, servicers must execute a Servicer Participation Agreement (SPA) with Fannie Mae, in its capacity as financial agent for the United States, on or before October 3, 2010.

08/10/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-174.cfm,HUD Charges Chicago Real Estate Group and Property Owners with Housing Discrimination,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced that it is charging a Chicago couple, their real estate agent, and a real estate broker with refusing to sell a home listed for $1.79 million to a black couple because of their race, in violation of the Fair Housing Act. The charge alleges that owners Daniel and Adrienne Sabbia and real estate agent Jeffrey Lowe stalled negotiations and took the property off the market after receiving a $1.7 million offer from radio personality and comedian George Willborn and his wife, businesswoman Peytyn Willborn.
The Willborns submitted the highest offer the sellers had received in the two years the property was on the market. Yet, when faced with the sales contract, the Sabbias refused to sign it. Real estate agent Jeffrey Lowe told HUD investigators that Daniel Sabbia expressed a preference not to sell his home to an African-American.
The charge also names the Lowe Group Chicago, Inc. and real estate broker, Prudential Rubloff Properties.
""Racial fairness is important at all income levels. Civil rights enforcement must be the effective shield against housing discrimination that in this case wealth was not,"" stated John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing discrimination based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, and disability. This includes the selling, brokering or appraising of a real estate property. HUD's action is also on behalf of the prospective buyers' real estate agent who was effectively denied a commission by the alleged discriminatory action of the sellers.
The HUD charge will be heard by an Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to aggrieved persons for the damages caused them by the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief to deter further discrimination, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose fines in order to vindicate the public interest. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages to aggrieved persons.
FHEO and its partners in the Fair Housing Assistance Program investigate more than 10,000 housing discrimination complaints annually. People who believe they are the victims of housing discrimination should contact HUD at 1-800-669-9777 (voice), 800-927-9275 (TTY)."
08/11/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-175.cfm,HUD Charges Pennsylvania Property Owners and Managers with Housing Discrimination,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is charging several Bristol, Pennsylvania property owners and their management company with housing discrimination for refusing to rent a one-bedroom apartment to a mother and her seven-year-old daughter. According to HUD's charge, managers and owners Quality Realty Associates and Vincent Quattrocchi, and owners Louis Quattrocchi and Cecilia Quattrocchi, violated the Fair Housing Act by turning away the mother because they did not permit children to live at their 26 apartment units.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing discrimination based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, and disability. It is illegal to deny housing to families with children under 18 years of age unless the housing qualifies as ""housing for older persons.""
""HUD stands with a working mother and child, when they are illegally denied housing,"" said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""The Fair Housing Act protects families with children so they can live in housing of their choice.""
HUD alleges that after the Pennsylvania woman inquired about an apartment managed by QRA, Vincent Quattrocchi told her that no children were allowed to reside in the apartment complex. Without other housing options, the mother and daughter eventually moved into a local shelter and were separated while the mother continued to search for an apartment.
Upon receiving the woman's complaint regarding the rental property, the Fair Housing Council of Suburban Pennsylvania, also a complainant in the case, sent four testers to inquire about vacant apartments. All were told that no children were allowed to reside in the apartments that QRA managed. During HUD's investigation, owner Louis Quattrocchi allegedly admitted that in the 30 to 40 years he has owned the properties he has never rented to families with children. Currently, no families live at the properties.
The HUD charge will be heard by an Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to aggrieved persons for the damages caused them by the discrimination.

Through the existing Housing Finance Agency (HFA) Innovation Fund for the Hardest Hit Housing Markets (the Hardest Hit Fund), the U.S. Department of the Treasury will make $2 billion of additional assistance available for HFA programs for homeowners struggling to make their mortgage payments due to unemployment. Additionally, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) will soon launch a complementary $1 billion Emergency Homeowners Loan Program to provide assistance - for up to 24 months - to homeowners who are at risk of foreclosure and have experienced a substantial reduction in income due to involuntary unemployment, underemployment, or a medical condition.
""We remain committed to helping struggling homeowners, and this program will provide additional assistance to states hit hardest by unemployment,"" said Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability Herb Allison. ""This is part of the Administration's comprehensive housing policy that has helped to stabilize a fragile housing market and allows responsible homeowners the chance to reduce their monthly mortgage payments to affordable levels.""
""HUD's new Emergency Homeowner Loan Program will build on Treasury's Hardest Hit initiative by targeting assistance to struggling unemployed homeowners in other hard hit areas to help them avoid preventable foreclosures,"" said Bill Apgar, HUD Senior Advisor for Mortgage Finance. ""Together, these initiatives represent a combined $3 billion investment that will ultimately impact a broad group of struggling borrowers across the country and in doing so further contribute to the Administration's efforts to stabilize housing markets and communities across the country.""
Hardest Hit Fund
President Obama first announced the Hardest Hit Fund in February 2010 to allow states hit hard by the economic downturn flexibility in determining how to design and implement programs to meet the local challenges homeowners in their state are facing.
Under the additional assistance announced today, states eligible to receive support have all experienced an unemployment rate at or above the national average over the past 12 months. Each state will use the funds for targeted unemployment programs that provide temporary assistance to eligible homeowners to help them pay their mortgage while they seek re-employment, additional employment or undertake job training.
States that have already benefited from previously announced assistance under the Hardest Hit Fund may use these additional resources to support the unemployment programs previously approved by Treasury or they may opt to implement a new unemployment program. States that do not currently have Hardest Hit Fund unemployment programs must submit proposals to Treasury by September 1, 2010 that, within established guidelines, meet the distinct needs of their state.
The states eligible to receive funds through this additional assistance, along with allocations based on their population sizes, are as follows:
HUD Emergency Homeowners Loan Program
This new program will complement Treasury's Hardest Hit Fund by providing assistance to homeowners in hard hit local areas that may not be included in the hardest hit target states. Those areas are still being determined.
The program will work through a variety of state and non-profit entities and will offer a declining balance, deferred payment ""bridge loan"" (zero percent interest, non-recourse, subordinate loan) for up to $50,000 to assist eligible borrowers with payments on their mortgage principal, interest, mortgage insurance, taxes and hazard insurance for up to 24 months.
Under the program, eligible borrowers must:
• Be at least three months delinquent in their payments and have a reasonable likelihood of being able to resume repayment of their mortgage payments and related housing expenses within two years;
• Have a mortgage property that is the principal residence of the borrower, and eligible borrowers may not own a second home;
• Demonstrate a good payment record prior to the event that produced the reduction of income.
HUD will announce additional details, including the targeted communities and other program specifics when the program is officially launched in the coming weeks."

These renovations will not only generate many necessary upgrades to thousands of affordable apartments, but they will also create jobs and save money for thousands of residents. A complete list of Recovery Act Green Retrofit Program awards being issued today can be viewed in full here.
The awards are part of HUD's Green Retrofit Program for Multifamily Housing, created for the first time through the Recovery Act. The Green Retrofit Program is providing $250 million nationally to reduce energy costs, cut water consumption, and improve indoor air quality. The awards announced today represent the first 100 grants and loans awarded through the program. The remaining awards will be made on a rolling basis from now through September 30, 2010.
The 100 awards announced today will create an average energy savings of $33,000 per property, or $3.3 million annually and, on average, tenants will save over $250 each on utility bills annually.
""I am proud to announce this significant Recovery Act milestone because it is an example of HUD's ongoing commitment to creating jobs while also building sustainable homes and communities,"" said Secretary Donovan. ""The Green Retrofit Program is just one example of how the Recovery Act is making a long-term impact on American families and communities by reducing energy costs, creating quality green jobs and improving the quality of life for people across the country.""
The Green Retrofit Program is designed to create thousands of green jobs as workers retrofit older federally assisted multi-family apartment developments with the next generation of energy efficient technologies. Grants and loans provided through this program help private landlords and property management companies to cut heating and air conditioning costs such as by installing more efficient heating and cooling systems, and to reduce water use such as by replacing faucets and toilets. These Recovery Act funds also produce other environmental benefits by encouraging the use of recycled building materials, reflective roofing, and non-toxic products to reduce 'off-gassing' of potentially harmful fumes. Funds are awarded to owners of HUD-assisted housing projects and can be used for a wide range of retrofit activities, ranging from windows/doors to solar panels and geothermal installation.
The Recovery Act included $13.61 billion for projects and programs administered by HUD, nearly 75 percent of which was allocated to state and local recipients only eight days after President Obama signed the Act into law. The remaining 25 percent is being awarded through competitive grant programs, including the Green Retrofit Program. To date, over 99 percent of HUD's Recovery Act funds are in the hands of local communities, being used to improve housing and neighborhoods, while creating jobs. HUD is committed to implementing Recovery Act investments swiftly and effectively as they generate tens of thousands of jobs, modernize homes to make them energy efficient, and help the families and communities hardest hit by the economic crisis.
In addition, Secretary Donovan and the Department are committed to providing the highest level of transparency possible as Recovery Act funds are administered. It is vitally important that the American people are fully aware of how their tax dollars are being spent and can hold their federal leaders accountable. Every dollar of Recovery Act funds HUD spends can be reviewed and tracked at HUD's Recovery Act website. The full text of HUD's funding notices and tracking of future performance of these grants is also available at HUD's Recovery Act website."

In July, housing prices remained level after 30 straight months of decline, while some price predictions have improved. In addition, historic low interest rates continued to promote home affordability and refinancing options for the nation's families. However, the market remains fragile with foreclosure starts showing a slight increase and serious delinquencies continuing to work through the pipeline.
""While there has been some stabilization in the housing market, it remains clear that we have more work ahead,"" said HUD Assistant Secretary Raphael Bostic. ""Through the Obama Administration's efforts over the past 16 months, we have seen increased price stabilization and improved home affordability for prospective, qualified homebuyers.

The August Housing Scorecard features key data on the health of the housing market including:
Stabilizing housing prices drive improving expectations in some regions. After 30 straight months of decline, home prices have leveled off in the past year; futures indices have shifted upward since January 2009 as signs of recovery continue, although overall housing outlook measures remain mixed. More than twice as many modification arrangements begun compared to foreclosure completions. More than 3.15 million modification arrangements were done from April 2009 through the end of June 2010. This includes more than 1.3 million trial Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) modifications started, over 472,000 Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loss mitigation and early delinquency interventions, and 1.4 million proprietary modifications under HOPE Now. The number of agreements offered continues to more than double foreclosure completions for the same period (1.24 million). More than 4.2 million families have benefited from housing counseling since April 2009. Working with a HUD-approved housing counselor can help borrowers manage debts apart from a mortgage - car payments, credit cards and personal loans, for example - and help them avoid falling into default. More than 37,000 homeowners received a HAMP permanent modification in July. While the pace of program entry has slowed due to upfront documentation requirements in place since June 1, this policy change streamlines the process to help more eligible homeowners convert to a permanent modification. Homeowners in permanent modifications are experiencing a median payment reduction of 36 percent, or more than $500 per month.

Data in the scorecard show that the recovery in the housing market continues to remain fragile, with some measures suggesting recovery will take place over time. For example, foreclosure starts went up slightly in July from the previous month, but remain well below July 2009 levels.
Foreclosure completions also inched upward as the volume of serious delinquencies continues to work through the pipeline.
Each month, the Housing Scorecard incorporates key housing market indicators and highlights the impact of the Administration's unprecedented housing recovery efforts, including assistance to homeowners through the FHA and HAMP.

08/24/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-183.cfm,Donovan Announces $65 Million in Available Funding to Support Community Development in Indian Country,"SIOUX FALLS, SD - U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan traveled to a Native American community in South Dakota today to announce $65 million in available funding to support a variety of community development and affordable housing production in Indian country throughout the U.S. Donovan made the announcement following a tour of the Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota with Senator Tim Johnson.
""This funding will provide the building blocks needed to improve our Native American communities,"" said Donovan. ""Now, more than ever, these grants are critical to promote neighborhood development, produce affordable housing, and help extremely low-income persons find their place in their own communities.""
Senator Johnson added, ""During today's visit to the Rosebud Reservation, Secretary Donovan and I spoke to people who face the daily challenge of finding safe and stable housing for their families. I am hopeful that today's announcement will serve as an important step forward in revitalizing communities and improving access to quality housing in Native American communities in South Dakota and throughout our country.""
The grant funding being offered to Native American communities will be awarded competitively through HUD's Indian Community Development Block Grant (ICDBG) program. The ICDBG program provides eligible grantees with direct grants for use in developing viable Indian and Alaska Native Communities, including decent housing, a suitable living environment and economic opportunities, primarily for low- and moderate-income persons.
ICDBG funds may be used to improve housing, community facilities and infrastructure. In addition the program helps to expand job opportunities by supporting the economic development of the communities, especially by nonprofit tribal organizations or local development corporations. HUD will reserve up to $3.96 million of the available funding to help Native American communities to address imminent threats to health or safety that require immediate solutions. Those 'Imminent Threat Grants' will be awarded on a first-come basis to eligible applicants.
HUD's Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) makes clear that ICDBG grants will be awarded to Native American and Alaska Native communities on a regional basis at levels similar to those last year.
Eligible applicants for ICDBG grants include any Indian tribe, band, group, or nation (including Alaska Indians, Aleut, and Eskimos) or Alaska Native village which has established a relationship to the Federal government as defined in the program's rules. In certain instances, tribal organizations may be eligible to apply. Once again, grant applications will be submitted online through the government-wide grants.gov portal."
08/24/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-184.cfm,HUD Charges Northeast Ohio Landlord with Housing Discrimination,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced that it is charging Testa Family Enterprises, LTD, owner of Royal Arms Apartments in Ravenna, Ohio, and the complex's manager with housing discrimination for allegedly refusing to rent certain apartments to families with young children. HUD's charge alleges that manager Christine Testa and Testa Family Enterprises, LTD, violated the Fair Housing Act by limiting or refusing to rent to families with small children.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing discrimination based on familial status, including preferences or limitations that would effectively discriminate against families with children. It is unlawful to refuse to rent to families with children.
""The days of routine 'No Children' rental policies are over,"" stated John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""The Fair Housing Act prohibits them and HUD will enforce the law to protect the rights of families with children.""
According to HUD's charge, a single mother of two young children responded to an advertisement for a two-bedroom apartment managed by Ms. Testa. After the mother informed Ms. Testa that she had two young children, Ms. Testa allegedly told the woman that she did not rent to ""people with small children,"" and denied the mother the opportunity to view the unit. The mother subsequently contacted the Fair Housing Advocates Association, an Akron-based non-profit fair housing organization, which conducted three telephone tests. During the telephone tests, Ms. Testa allegedly made statements indicating a preference against renting to families with young children and/or refused to rent to the tester based on the age of the children present in the household. HUD's investigation also revealed that the complex had an unwritten restriction limiting families with children to units on the ground level.
The HUD charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to aggrieved persons for the damages caused them by the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief to deter further discrimination, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose fines in order to vindicate the public interest. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages to aggrieved persons.
FHEO and its partners in the Fair Housing Assistance Program investigate more than 10,000 housing discrimination complaints annually. People who believe they are the victims of housing discrimination should contact HUD at 1-800-669-9777 (voice), 800-927-9275 (TTY)."
08/25/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-185.cfm,HUD Announces $189 Million Available to Revitalize Communities,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced today that it is making $189 million in grants available to transform public and assisted housing and to revitalize communities. Appearing in today's Federal Register are the Notices of Funding Availability, the federal application, for two revitalization initiatives: The Choice Neighborhoods FY 2010 and the HOPE VI FY 2010. Both applications can be accessed at www.grants.gov.
While the nearly 20-year-old HOPE VI Revitalization Program has been successful at transforming neighborhoods with distressed public housing into revitalized mixed-income communities, Choice Neighborhoods aims to use a more comprehensive approach to community development with housing transformation as its center.
""We have seen remarkable success under our HOPE VI program over the last 17 years. This funding will help continue that work to transform public housing projects and improve outcomes for tens of thousands of public housing tenants,"" said HUD Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing Sandra Henriquez. ""But even some of the best HOPE VI projects are islands of hope surrounded by a sea of need. By coupling this round of HOPE VI funding with the first awards in our Choice Neighborhoods initiative, we're transitioning toward investing in strategies to address interconnected challenges - housing decay, crime, lack of educational prospects and economic connections - that keep families and communities in severe distress.""
The pilot year Choice Neighborhoods competitive program will award up to $65 million to public housing authorities, local governments, nonprofit organizations, and for profit developers that apply jointly with a public entity to extend neighborhood transformation efforts beyond public and/or assisted housing, to link housing revitalization with education reform and early childhood education.
""We are proud to work with HUD to ensure that there are great schools at the center of every Choice Neighborhood,"" said Assistant Deputy Secretary Jim Shelton of the Department of Education's Office of Innovation and Improvement. ""Our partnership is an important step to breaking down Federal agency silos and providing comprehensive tools to revitalize neighborhoods of concentrated poverty into neighborhoods of opportunity.""
Choice Neighborhoods Planning and Implementation Grants - The $65 million Choice Neighborhoods pilot expands HOPE VI's redevelopment toolkit to allow for redevelopment of both public and other HUD-assisted housing properties. This means that the disinvested assisted housing that frustrated cities and housing authorities and fostered crime and blight can now be included in comprehensive neighborhood revitalization efforts. The program also widens the traditional pool of eligible applicants by allowing local governments, nonprofits and for-profit developers that submit joint applications with a public entity.
Applicants have until October 26, 2010 to apply for Choice Neighborhoods Planning or Implementation grants. It is anticipated that 12-15 Planning Grants will be made with a maximum award of $250,000 each.
Decisions on Implementation grant applications will be made through a two-round application process. Upon conclusion of its review in Round 1, HUD will select approximately 10 finalists and publish a Round 2 NOFA. Finalists will have the opportunity to submit a more detailed plan for community transformation. Approximately 2-4 implementation grants will then be awarded, at a maximum of $31 million each.
""This dual-round process was designed to better serve applicants,"" said HUD Deputy Assistant Secretary for Multifamily Housing Programs Carol Galante. ""By making our initial decisions on summaries, we hope to minimize applicants' financial investments to develop deeper, more comprehensive transformation plans and concentrate on those proposals most poised to make substantive change in our nation's most distressed communities.""
HOPE VI Revitalization Awards - There have been 254 HOPE VI Revitalization grants awarded to 132 housing authorities since 1993 - totaling more than $6.1 billion. These grants have transformed severely distressed public housing developments to mixed-income communities. Revitalization grant funds are used for an array of activities, including: demolition of severely distressed public housing; acquisition of sites for off-site construction; capital costs of major rehabilitation, new construction and other physical improvements; and community and supportive service programs for residents, including those relocated as a result of revitalization efforts.
HOPE VI Revitalization grant applicants will have until November 22, 2010 to submit applications. It is anticipated that five to six grant awards will be made, with a maximum award of $22 million each.
Applicants must refer to the FY 2010 General Section for important application information and requirements, including submission requirements, which are different from the 2009 application. In FY2010, HUD is continuing its requirement that applicants submit their applications electronically through www.grants.gov."
08/26/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-186.cfm,HUD Awards $312 Million in Disaster Recovery Grants to Help States Reduce Damages from Future Disasters,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Shaun Donovan today awarded nearly $312 million to 13 states to invest in efforts to reduce the human, physical, and economic toll of future disasters. The grants announced today are provided through HUD's Disaster Recovery Enhancement Fund (DREF) and are intended to encourage states to undertake activities and long-term strategies that focus on reducing damages from future natural disasters.
In the past two years, HUD allocated more than $5.6 billion in disaster recovery funding through its Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) to these states. The DREF was established to support the long-term recovery following dozens of natural disasters in 2008. As a result of having received CDBG funds for those disasters, these 13 states were eligible to receive additional allocations based on the significant investment they've made by targeting their CDBG funds to disaster mitigation.
""An ounce of prevention today can spare communities a world of hurt tomorrow,"" said Donovan. ""We're making a serious investment in our future by making certain that when disaster strikes, the impacted communities in these states can weather the storm.""
Disaster mitigation, like those that qualify for funding through the DREF, are a sound investment. According to an independent study by the National Institute of Building Sciences (www.floods.org/PDF/MMC_Volume1_FindingsConclusionsRecommendations.pdf), every dollar spent on disaster mitigation activities saves taxpayers $4 in future disaster recovery expenses. The 13 states that received funding through the DREF invested nearly $876 million in disaster mitigation which translates into a total anticipated return on investment of more than $3.5 billion.
The purpose of the DREF is to reward states that invested CDBG disaster recovery funding in activities that reduce risks from future disasters. HUD recognizes that while these types of activities are often more expensive in the short-term, they dramatically cut recovery costs over the long-term. To help assist with the additional cost of mitigating future risk, DREF funds can be used toward projects meeting unmet disaster recovery needs, and those that include:
Buyout payments for homeowners living in high-risk areas; Optional relocation payments to encourage residents to move to safer locations; Home improvement grants to reduce damage risks (property elevation, reinforced garage doors and windows, etc.); Improving and enforcing building codes; and Developing forward-thinking land-use plans that reduce development in high-risk areas.

HUD is awarding DREF grants to the following states:"
09/01/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-187.cfm,HUD Secretary Announces National First Look Program to Help Communities Stabilize Neighborhoods Hard-Hit by Foreclosure,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Shaun Donovan today announced an unprecedented agreement with the nation's top mortgage lenders to offer selected state and local governments, and nonprofit organizations a ""first look"" or right of first refusal to purchase foreclosed homes before making these properties available to private investors.
The National First Look Program is a first-ever public-private partnership agreement between HUD and the National Community Stabilization Trust (Stabilization Trust). In collaboration with national servicers, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac, the First Look program is intended to give communities participating in HUD's Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) a brief exclusive opportunity to purchase bank-owned properties in certain neighborhoods so these homes can either be rehabilitated, rented, resold or demolished.
""This groundbreaking agreement will help rebuild neighborhoods that have been struggling with blight and declining home values due to foreclosures,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""Local communities will now get an exclusive option to buy foreclosed properties in targeted neighborhoods so they can turn the homes into affordable housing or, in some cases, tear them down. This agreement helps us level the playing field to give communities a better chance to stabilize these neighborhoods.""
""The Stabilization Trust is delighted to be working with HUD Secretary Donovan on the National First Look Program,"" said Craig Nickerson, President of the NCST. ""By serving as the operations 'engine' behind the First Look Program, the Stabilization Trust can facilitate the transfer of more foreclosed property for participating financial institutions to local community buyers, thereby accelerating the road to neighborhood recovery.""
HUD's NSP grantees, which include state and local governments and non-profit organizations, often find themselves competing with private investors for real estate-owned (REO) properties, which can hinder their efforts to stabilize neighborhoods with high foreclosure activity. With today's announcement, HUD and the Stabilization Trust, working with national servicers, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac, will standardize the acquisition process for NSP grantees, giving them an exclusive option to purchase foreclosed upon homes in certain targeted neighborhoods.
The Stabilization Trust pioneered the 'First Look' model to create a transparent and streamlined process to facilitate the transfer of foreclosed and abandoned properties from key financial institutions to local government housing providers. First piloted in 2008, the model has gained recognition as a critical tool for positively tipping the scale in neighborhoods hard hit by foreclosures. NSP grantees will also be aided by REOMatch™, a web-based mapping and acquisition management tool developed by the Stabilization Trust. REOMatch will assist NSP grantees easily identify REO properties and make more strategic decisions about which properties to acquire, based on real-time data on an interactive mapping platform.
The nation's leading financial institutions are participating in the National First Look Program, representing approximately 75 percent of the REO marketplace. Participating institutions include: Bank of America, Chase, Citi, Deutsche Bank, GMAC, Nationstar Mortgage, Ocwen Financial Corporation, Saxon Mortgage Services, U.S. Bank, Wells Fargo, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Housing Administration (FHA).
The National First Look Program will allow NSP grantees the exclusive opportunity to purchase available REO properties located within the defined boundaries of NSP target areas. NSP grantees will be immediately notified when a property becomes available and will have 24-48 hours to express interest in pursuing a specific property. Furthermore, these institutions will provide NSP purchasers with the opportunity to purchase REO properties at a discount their appraised value, reflecting the cost savings of a quick sale. NSP grantees may acquire these properties with the assistance of NSP funds for any eligible use.
After expressing interest in a property, the First Look Period will last approximately five to 12 business days during which the NSP Grantee will conduct inspections and establish costs to repair in anticipation of the financial institution's price offer. In the event that no NSP grantee exercises its preference to purchase an REO property during the First Look period, the financial institution will follow its normal process to sell the home on the open market.
Currently, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) offers a complementary pilot program in which NSP grantees receive an exclusive option to purchase so-called 'HUD Homes' at a discount prior to those homes being made available to the investor community. The FHA pilot, alongside today's agreement expands the opportunity for NSP grantees to gain access to REO properties through a national first-look standard option.
HUD's Neighborhood Stabilization Program was created to address the housing crisis, create jobs, and grow local economies by providing communities with the resources to purchase and rehabilitate vacant homes. NSP grants are helping state and local governments, as well as non-profit developers, acquire land and property; demolish or rehabilitate abandoned properties; and/or offer downpayment and closing cost assistance to low- to middle-income homebuyers. Grantees can also stabilize neighborhoods by creating ""land banks"" to assemble, temporarily manage, and dispose of foreclosed homes. To date, HUD has allocated nearly $6 billion in funding to state and local governments and non-profit housing developments. In the coming weeks, HUD will allocate an additional $1 billion in NSP funding, which was provided through the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act."
09/02/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-188.cfm,HUD Secretary Announces National First Look Program to Help Communities Stabilize Neighborhoods Hard-Hit by Foreclosure,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today announced that it is making approximately $110 million in grants available to help eliminate dangerous lead-based paint from lower income homes and to protect young children from lead poisoning. The grants to States and local governments are being offered through HUD's Lead-Based Paint Hazard Control and Lead Hazard Reduction Demonstration Programs.
""These grants are critical for States, counties and cities who are on the front lines of protecting our children from dangerous lead hazards,"" said Jon Gant, Director of the Office of Healthy Homes and Lead Hazard Control. ""While we have made remarkable progress toward eliminating lead poisoning in children nationwide, now is the time to focus on reaching the finish line. We look forward to communities applying for these grants so that they can help make older housing safer and healthier for children.""
HUD is providing an opportunity for applicants through its Lead-Based Paint Hazard Control Grant Program. Prospective grantees will be able to apply for supplementary funding to promote and develop a local Healthy Housing initiative, building on their lead hazard control program, to address multiple housing-related health hazards in accordance with best practices HUD has identified. In addition, the Department will announce the availability of funds for four Healthy Homes and lead grant programs in the near future.
HUD requires prospective grantees to submit their applications electronically via www.grants.gov. Any changes to HUD-published funding notices will be made available to the public through a Federal Register publication and published on this government-wide portal (http://www.grants.gov/). Applicants are urged to sign up for Grants.gov's notification service to receive periodic updates or changes to this grant offering."
09/07/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-190.cfm,FHA Short Refinance Option Now Available,"WASHINGTON - In an effort to help responsible homeowners who owe more on their mortgage than the value of their property, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today will begin providing an additional refinancing option for underwater borrowers. Originally announced in March, this enhancement of Federal Housing Administration (FHA) refinance program will offer certain 'underwater' non-FHA borrowers who are current on their existing mortgage and whose lien holders agree to write off at least ten percent of the unpaid principal balance of the first mortgage, the opportunity to qualify for a new FHA-insured mortgage.
The FHA Short Refinance option is targeted to help people who owe more on their mortgage than their home is worth - also known as being 'underwater' - because their local markets saw large declines in home values. As announced earlier this year, this change as well as other programs that have been put in place will help the Obama Administration meet its goal of stabilizing housing markets by offering a second chance to up to 3 to 4 million struggling homeowners through the end of 2012.
Participation in FHA's short refinance program is voluntary and requires the consent of all lien holders. To be eligible for a new loan, the homeowner must owe more on their mortgage than their home is worth and be current on their existing mortgage. The homeowner must qualify for the new loan under standard FHA underwriting requirements. The property must be the homeowner's primary residence and the borrower's existing first lien holder must agree to write off at least 10% of their unpaid principal balance. In addition, the existing loan to be refinanced must not be an FHA-insured loan, and the refinanced FHA-insured first mortgage must have a loan-to-value ratio of no more than 97.75 percent and a combined loan-to-value ratio no greater than 115 percent.
To facilitate the refinancing of new FHA-insured loans under this program, the U.S. Department of Treasury will provide incentives to existing second lien holders who agree to full or partial extinguishment of the liens. To be eligible, servicers must execute a Servicer Participation Agreement (SPA) with Fannie Mae, in its capacity as financial agent for the United States, on or before October 3, 2010.
For more information on FHA Short Refinance option, read FHA's mortgagee letter on HUD's website."
09/08/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-189.cfm,Obama Administration Awards Additional $1 Billion to Stabilize Neighborhoods Hard-Hit by Foreclosure,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan today awarded an additional $1 billion in funding to all states along with a number of counties and local communities struggling to reverse the effects of the foreclosure crisis. The grants announced today represent a third round of funding through HUD's Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) and will provide targeted emergency assistance to state and local governments to acquire, redevelop or demolish foreclosed properties. For a complete listing of the allocations announced today, visit HUD's website.
""These grants will support local efforts to reverse the effects these foreclosed properties have on their surrounding neighborhoods,"" said Donovan. ""We want to make certain that we target these funds to those places with especially high foreclosure activity so we can help turn the tide in our battle against abandonment and blight. As a direct result of the leadership provided by Senator Chris Dodd and Congressman Barney Frank, who played key roles in winning approval for these funds, we will be able to make investments that will reduce blight, bolster neighboring home values, create jobs and produce affordable housing.""
The funding announced today is provided under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. To date, there have been two other rounds of NSP funding: the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA) provided $3.92 billion and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act) appropriated an additional $2 billion. Like those earlier rounds of NSP grants, these targeted funds will be used to purchase foreclosed homes at a discount and to rehabilitate or redevelop them in order to respond to rising foreclosures and falling home values. Today, 95 cents of every dollar from the first round of NSP funding is obligated - and is in use by communities, buying up and renovating homes, and creating jobs.
State and local governments can use their neighborhood stabilization grants to acquire land and property; to demolish or rehabilitate abandoned properties; and/or to offer downpayment and closing cost assistance to low- to moderate-income homebuyers (household incomes not exceed 120 percent of area median income). In addition, these grantees can create ""land banks"" to assemble, temporarily manage, and dispose of vacant land for the purpose of stabilizing neighborhoods and encouraging re-use or redevelopment of urban property. HUD will issue an NSP3 guidance notice in the next few weeks to assist grantees in designing their programs and applying for funds.
NSP 3 will take full advantage of the historic First Look partnership Secretary Donovan announced with the National Community Stabilization Trust last week. First Look gives NSP grantees an exclusive 12-14 day window to evaluate and bid on properties before others can do so. By giving every NSP grantee the first crack at buying foreclosed and abandoned properties in these targeted neighborhoods, First Look will maximize the impact of NSP dollars in the hardest-hit neighborhoods - making it more likely the properties communities want to buy are strategically chosen and cutting in half the traditional 75-to-85 day process it takes to re-sell foreclosed properties.
NSP also seeks to prevent future foreclosures by requiring housing counseling for families receiving homebuyer assistance. HUD seeks to protect future homebuyers by requiring States and local grantees to ensure that new homebuyers under NSP receive homeownership counseling and obtain a mortgage loan from a lender who agrees to comply with sound lending practices.
In determining the allocations announced today, HUD, as it did with NSP1, followed key indicators for the distribution formula outlined by Congress. HUD is using the latest data to implement the Congressional formula. The formula weighs several factors to match funding to need in the 20 percent most distressed neighborhoods as determined based on the number and percentage of home foreclosures, the number and percentage of homes financed by a subprime mortgage related loan, and the number and percentage of homes in delinquency. To estimate the level of need down to the neighborhood level, HUD uses a model that takes into account causes of foreclosures and delinquencies, which include housing price declines from peak levels, and increases in unemployment, and rate of high cost and highly leveraged loans. HUD also considers vacancy problems in neighborhoods with severe foreclosure related problems.
In addition to a third round of NSP funding, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act creates a $1 billion Emergency Homeowners Loan Program to be administered by HUD. This loan program will provide up to 24 months in mortgage assistance to homeowners who are at risk of foreclosure and have experienced a substantial reduction in income due to involuntary unemployment, underemployment, or a medical condition. HUD will announce additional details, including the targeted areas and other program specifics when the program is officially launched in the coming weeks."
09/13/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/OIGpr10-01.cfm,Donohue Leaving HUD's Office of the Inspector General,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Inspector General, Kenneth M. Donohue today announced that he is leaving federal service in October.
Mr. Donohue was nominated and confirmed in March of 2002 after retiring from the federal law enforcement community.
During his tenure, he guided the HUD Office of Inspector General (OIG) through the most tumultuous years of the Department's history.
Early on, the HUD OIG was at the epicenter of the attack on the World Trade Center (WTC) on September 11th when the HUD OIG New York field office was destroyed. Mr. Donohue ordered HUD OIG agents from across the country to New York City to assist in the investigation that followed the attack.
Throughout the reconstruction of the WTC site, HUD OIG auditors have continually audited the expenditure of funds thereby reducing the exposure of funds to fraudulent activities.
HUD OIG joined other federal law enforcement agencies in the investigation following the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster and also participated in the investigation and search for the DC Sniper.
When the Gulf Coast region was devastated by hurricanes, the HUD OIG was called upon to conduct oversight and was instrumental in auditing programs and leading investigations of improper activities.
Eighteen months before the subprime-related crisis, Mr. Donohue testified in the Congress to the dangers facing the U.S. mortgage industry and housing sector. His strident efforts then against certain proposed changes in Federal Housing Administration practices and programs mitigated the impact on the FHA insurance fund that would have likely negatively influenced FHA's financial position. He likewise testified his concerns regarding Ginnie Mae's posture as its portfolio greatly expanded.
The HUD OIG has persistently pursued public corruption among HUD's grantees and within the Department and as a testament to its reputation has been regularly asked to audit and investigate other inspector general operations within government.
The HUD OIG has maintained a well-trained and motivated staff of auditors and investigators employing forward-thinking and innovative techniques and systems solutions.
Mr. Donohue is leaving the HUD OIG to join the private sector."
09/13/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-191.cfm,Obama Administration Awards Additional $1 Billion to Stabilize Neighborhoods Hard-Hit by Foreclosure,"NEW ORLEANS - In the five years since Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf coast, the New Orleans metropolitan area lost 75,000 housing units or nearly 13 percent of its housing stock. In addition, the median monthly cost of housing rose by nearly 33 percent, from $662 in 2004 to $882 in 2009. These are among the key findings of a new housing survey presented today by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
HUD's 2009 New Orleans Metropolitan Area Housing Survey (www.huduser.org/portal/datasets/ahs/ahsdata09_metro_intro.html) is the most comprehensive analysis of the area's housing stock since the Department's last substantive assessment in 2004 (prior to Hurricane Katrina) and includes data from Jefferson, Orleans, Plaquemines, St. Bernard, St. Charles, St. James, St. John the Baptist, and St. Tammany Parishes. The 2009 survey also provides a critical point of comparison since Hurricane Katrina and offers an in-depth progress report of the redevelopment of the metro area following the storm. HUD plans another housing survey in 2011 to further gauge progress in the restoration of the area's housing stock.
""This survey presents a startling picture of just how disruptive Hurricane Katrina was to the lives of tens of thousands of families throughout the New Orleans area,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""The numbers also offer clear evidence of where things stood in 2009, providing a benchmark for the Obama Administration's work to help New Orleans recover and rebuild.""
Dr. Raphael Bostic, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research, added, ""The New Orleans metro area suffered a great deal from Katrina, and that suffering extended beyond just the housing stock to include the generations of families who called that area their home. While fewer families remain in transition, we're seeing significant increases in the cost of housing, especially for lower and middle-income renters.""
Based on in-depth interviews with residents of approximately 3,000 housing units, HUD estimates that more than 80 percent of the area's households were forced to move because of Hurricane Katrina and approximately 12 percent still consider themselves in flux. HUD also found that approximately 298,000 households were forced from their homes for at least two weeks after the storm; most families moved twice or three times and some moved as many as ten times.
Meanwhile, the Obama Administration is taking important steps to help remaining displaced families find long-term housing solutions. Since President Obama took office, HUD worked aggressively with nearly 350 local housing authorities around the country to extend housing assistance for more than 30,000 families who were on the verge of losing their temporary assistance. In addition, HUD provided permanent housing support for more than 12,000 of the most vulnerable households.
HUD has also helped stimulate privately owned affordable housing developments, creating 8,400 new affordable homes in New Orleans since 2009. In total, this means there is more federally assisted housing in New Orleans today than there was before Hurricane Katrina.
Donovan added, ""It's clear that this Administration is focused on the long-term recovery of the New Orleans area and the restoration of its affordable housing stock in particular. But we will not rest until every displaced family has a permanent place to call home.""
Key findings in the 2009 New Orleans Metropolitan Area Housing Survey include:
Composition of the Housing Stock - HUD estimates that in 2009 there were 511,000 residential housing units in the New Orleans metro area compared to 587,000 units in 2004. This 13 percent decline is largely explained by demolition activity, particularly among older single-family attached homes built prior to 1979. In addition, approximately 24,700 new homes were constructed in the New Orleans metro area between 2004 and 2009. Considering the loss of many older homes and the addition of newly built units, the median year of construction of the area's housing stock is currently 1972 compared to 1960 prior to Hurricane Katrina. HUD's 2009 survey also indicates there are an estimated 72,500 vacant housing units in the New Orleans metro area.
Monthly Housing Costs - The median monthly cost of housing in the New Orleans metro area was $882 in 2009 compared to $662 in 2004, a jump of 33.2 percent. While this significant increase is true for both owner- and renter-occupied units, the trend is largely attributed to the decline of ""mid-priced"" rental units ($300-$600/month) from 66,300 in 2004 to just 19,300 in 2009. The median rent charged to New Orleans-area tenants was $689 in 2004 compared to $876 in 2009, an increase of 27 percent. The 2004 housing cost data noted above have been adjusted for inflation to reflect ""2009 dollars"" to provide a true comparison. HUD's survey also calculated ""worst case housing needs"" in the New Orleans metro area. These are very low-income, unassisted renter households who either paid more than half their income on rent, lived in severely inadequate housing or both. HUD found that while the total number of renter households declined by 32,000 from 2004 and 2009, the number of worst case renter households grew by nearly 6,500 or 22 percent.
Forced to Move - Because of Hurricane Katrina, more than 307,000 households were forced to move from their homes and share housing with others, primarily family and friends. Since Katrina, almost 59,000 families (19 percent) moved once; 95,000 families moved twice (32 percent); 77,000 families moved three times; and more than 68,000 households moved as many as ten times. In 2009, more than 38,000 families still consider themselves in transition.
Damaged Housing - Of the 252,000 owner-occupied housing units that sustained damage during Hurricane Katrina, 90 percent have undergone repair through private insurance payouts, federal flood insurance and/or homeowner assistance grants provided through Louisiana's HUD-funded Road Home Program. More than 52 percent of owners of damaged units reoccupied their homes while only 25 percent of homeowners reoccupied their severely damaged units. More than 18,000 area homeowners either have or intend to elevate their homes. In addition, almost than 11,000 homes were razed or condemned due to Katrina damage, but nearly 10,000 of these were rebuilt.
HUD's data files are intended for use by economists, housing analysts and others in the research community. The Census Bureau expects to release a more comprehensive narrative report on these data later this fall. In addition, HUD and Census intend to conduct yet another survey in the New Orleans metropolitan area next year to gain further insight into the area's housing recovery since 2009."

09/15/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-194.cfm,HUD Refines Its Financial Systems Modernization Plans,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it will modify a planned approach to its financial systems modernization effort and focus on a single core financial system.
""Our strategic shift is a sign of the tough economic times,"" said Doug Criscitello, HUD's Chief Financial Officer. ""We have been working on the HUD Integrated Financial Management Improvement Project (HIFMIP) for several years and have determined that more focused approach to our financial systems modernization will still get us where we need to be while ensuring that we are not overspending.""
The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has led an effort to improve financial systems throughout the Federal government. Following a series of discussions with OMB and the newly created Financial Systems Advisory Board (FSAB), HUD realized its critical business needs could be met with a core financial system while it reevaluates the need to integrate additional systems. Using this approach may result in a savings of up to $44 million.
HUD's original plan proposed implementing three separate upgrades to its financial systems beginning with its core system used for most of the Department, to be followed in coming years by an integration of financial systems and information from HUD organizational components Ginnie Mae and the Federal Housing Administration (FHA).
Once the modernization of the core system gets underway this year, HUD will begin studying the efficacy of augmenting that system with Ginnie Mae and FHA systems. Consistent with the Administration's financial system modernization plans, HUD will consider three guiding principles when moving HIFMIP forward: (1) split projects into smaller, simpler segments with clear deliverables; (2) focus on the most critical business needs first; and (3) ensure ongoing, transparent project oversight.
""As a result of the Administration's emphasis on smart financial systems modernization, we have decided to revisit our systems risk and mitigation strategies along with governance structure to ensure appropriate leadership is in place to support the project and strategies for potential contract option periods,"" explained Criscitello. ""This plan is entirely consistent with the Department's goal to transform the way HUD does business. We are focused on bureaucracy busting to create flexible, modern systems that promote responsiveness, openness, and transparency."""

In its funding announcement, HUD notified applicants that it will rapidly award renewal grants to prevent interruption in federal assistance to existing local programs while awarding funds to new projects later in the year. To read the full text of the funding notice, visit HUD's website.
""The Obama Administration is committed to ending the preventable tragedy of homelessness and this funding will advance the goals of the historic national strategic federal plan to prevent and end homelessness, ""said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""HUD and its partners at the national and local level are doing a better job sheltering those who might otherwise be living on our streets, but clearly there is more to do. Homelessness is impacting our veterans and more and more families with children. That's why you will see special emphasis on those areas with this funding.""
On June 22, the lead Cabinet secretaries from the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH) submitted to the President and Congress the nation's first comprehensive strategy to prevent and end homelessness. The full report is titled Opening Doors: Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness. Doors serves as a roadmap for joint action by the 19 USICH member agencies along with local and state partners in the public and private sectors. The plan puts the country on a path to end veterans (www.usich.gov/PDF/FactSheetVeterans.pdf) and chronic homelessness (www.usich.gov/PDF/FactSheetChronicHomelessness.pdf) by 2015; and to ending homelessness among children (www.usich.gov/PDF/FactSheetFamilieswithChildren.pdf), family (www.usich.gov/PDF/FactSheetFamilieswithChildren.pdf), and youth (www.usich.gov/PDF/FactSheetYouth.pdf) by 2020. The Plan presents strategies building upon the lesson that mainstream housing, health, education, and human service programs must be fully engaged and coordinated to prevent and end homelessness.
HUD's official Notice of Funding Availability offers grants through the Department's Continuum of Care (CoC) homeless assistance programs. HUD is requiring all grant applications to be submitted through its web-based e-snaps system (electronic-special needs assistance programs system). The Department continues to refine e-snaps to ensure applicants can access a more user-friendly submission portal and to accelerate the grant awarding process.
Several changes and special interest areas in the new NOFA include:
Creating new permanent housing beds for disabled veterans is a HUD priority, and CoCs are encouraged to use at least a portion of available bonus funds that will be available during this funding cycle to create a project that will serve disabled veterans; CoCs will be required to demonstrate that they are collaborating with local education agencies to assist in the identification of homeless families as well as informing the homeless families and children they assist of their eligibility for education services available for homeless children and youth; Project applicants be required to demonstrate that they are considering the educational needs of children when families are placed in emergency or transitional shelter and to the maximum extent practicable, place families with children as close to possible to their school of origin so as not to disrupt the children's education; In 2010 the definition of Chronically Homeless Person has been expanded beyond individuals to include eligible families with children. Chronically homeless individuals and families also are a priority group for bonus funding in the competition. To achieve greater geographic diversity, HUD will give added selection priority to projects located in rural areas.

The Act also authorized HUD to make allocations directly to local governments if warranted based on damage and unmet needs. HUD calculated unmet needs for housing, business, and infrastructure recovery based on data provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Small Business Administration.
As a result of the calculations, the initial allocations are
Today's announcement is meant to comply with Congress' directive that one-half of the $100 million appropriated in July for disaster recovery be obligated within 90 days. HUD will provide grantees with guidance on preparing plans and applying for their allocations.

09/21/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-204.cfm,"HUD Approves Demolition for Unsafe Lake Monroe Terrace, Protects Residents with Vouchers","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced today that it has approved the demolition of 100 sub-standard public housing units at the Lake Monroe Terrace public housing development in Sanford, Fla. and approved the Sanford Housing Authority's (SHA) request for 86 rental assistance vouchers for current residents. The vouchers will give these families an opportunity to find long-term housing in a safe and habitable home.
In August, HUD provided the Sanford Housing Authority with $1.3 million in emergency funding to relocate the Lake Monroe Terrace families; provide temporary rental assistance and to secure the development. The housing authority will also receive $650,000 to fund the 86 vouchers for one year that will be renewed annually.
""While low-income families desperately need housing, families should not have to endure the living conditions they were subjected to at this development,"" said HUD Deputy Secretary Ron Sims who announced the vouchers at a speech to the Florida Housing Coalition Conference. ""Thanks to the strong advocacy of Congresswoman Brown and with this approval, I am pleased the Sanford Housing Authority can close the chapter on Lake Monroe Terrace and turn a new page for these families.""
""I am very pleased that the Obama Administration has approved the much needed demolition and Section 8 vouchers necessary to begin replacing Lake Monroe Terrace. Secretary Shaun Donovan, Deputy Secretary Ron Sims and Region IV Southeast Administrator Ed Jennings Jr., have been excellent partners and fully engaged in fixing the problems facing the Sanford Housing Authority,"" said Congresswoman Corrine Brown.
""The local elected officials, Sanford Housing Authority Board, and other stakeholders all need to work together as one team to ensure that these residents live in safe, decent housing. This funding will allow us to start that process,"" she continued.
Lake Monroe Terrace was built in 1972 and over the years conditions had deteriorated to the point that it was no longer cost effective to repair the units. SHA submitted an application to demolish the units in June. HUD's demolition approval triggered the eligibility for SHA to receive ""Tenant Protection Vouchers"" that will allow these families to rent housing from private landlords while paying no more than 30 percent of their income for rent.
Earlier this year, HUD conducted an assessment of SHA management operations when HUD received complaints about poor housing conditions and overall management deficiencies. HUD advised the Sanford Housing Authority Board of Directors to seek management guidance from an experienced agency. This has resulted in a temporary management agreement with the Orlando Housing Authority after the SHA board removed its executive director earlier this year.
Using the emergency funding, families have begun to relocate and to date approximately a dozen families have relocated with the remaining families working with the Orlando Housing Authority to locate alternative housing. HUD will continue to work with the SHA and the Orlando Housing to ensure all residents are provided safe, decent housing opportunities."
09/22/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-205.cfm,HUD Announces New Reverse Mortgage Option,"WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) today announced a new modified version of its Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) product. The HECM loan is a reverse mortgage insured by the federal government. It allows older home owners to tap into their equity to cover living expenses and health care costs while continuing to live in their home without having to make the mortgage payments that are required with a traditional mortgage or equity loan.
FHA designed HECM Saver as a second reverse mortgage option for the purpose of lowering upfront loan closing costs, for homeowners who want to borrow a smaller amount than what would be available with a HECM Standard loan. This option will be available for all HECM case numbers assigned on or after October 4, 2010.
""Despite the popularity of our HECM loan product, we have noted concerns that some senior citizens find that our fees are too high for them,"" said FHA Commissioner David Stevens. ""In response, we created HECM Saver which will provide seniors with a reverse mortgage option that significantly lowers costs by almost eliminating the upfront Mortgage Insurance Premium (MIP) that is required under the standard HECM option.""
HECM Saver will have an upfront premium of only .01 percent of the property's value. Under the HECM Standard option, the upfront premium will remain at 2 percent. The MIP for both HECM Saver and HECM Standard will be charged monthly at an annual rate of 1.25 percent of the outstanding loan balance.
The reduction in upfront fees will be accomplished while substantially lowering the risk to the FHA insurance fund because the principal limit or amount of money available to a borrower under the HECM Saver program will be reduced. Borrowers will receive approximately 10 to 18 percent less under the HECM Saver option, than they would receive under HECM Standard.
HECM borrowers may opt to receive funds as a lump sum at loan origination, establish a line of credit or request fixed monthly payments that are disbursed for as long as they continue to live in the home. Funds are advanced to the borrower and interest accrues, but the outstanding amount does not have to be repaid until the borrower dies, leaves the home or sells the property. At that time, if the balance due on the loan exceeds the value of the home, FHA insurance pays the difference.

The latest housing figures show continued signs of stabilization in house prices. Although existing and new home sales declined in July, recent data shows housing starts rebounded in August.
""Over the last 17 months, the Obama Administration has taken comprehensive action to keep interest rates at record lows, provide incentives to responsible homebuyers, and help millions of families stay in their homes,"" said HUD Assistant Secretary Raphael Bostic. ""But we're certainly not going to stop fighting to turn things around. That's why we are focusing on successfully implementing the programs we have put in place, such as additional assistance on refinancing and helping unemployed homeowners stay in their homes, and will continue to monitor the market closely in case more is needed.""
""We've been steadily enhancing our programs to help struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure,"" said Treasury Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability Herb Allison. ""We understand that the foreclosure crisis can be highly localized and some regions have seen severe home price declines and faced severe unemployment. As a result, we have announced more than $4 billion for states hit hardest by this crisis. Our goal is to help build a sustainable, long-term housing recovery. As part of that effort, we have delivered critical support to struggling homeowners while the market continues to heal.""
The September Housing Scorecard features key data on the health of the housing market including:
Families continued to benefit from the lowest rates in history on 30-year fixed mortgages. Since April of 2009, record low rates have helped more than 7.1 million homeowners to refinance, resulting in more stable home prices and $12.7 billion in total borrower savings. Existing and new home sales shifted downward in July, though stabilizing housing prices drove improving expectations in some regions. As expected with the expiration of the Homebuyer Tax Credit, new and existing home sales showed a dip in July. At the same time, home prices have leveled off in the past year after 30 straight months of decline and homeowners added $95 billion in home equity in the second quarter. More than twice as many modification arrangements have begun compared to foreclosure completions. More than 3.35 million modification arrangements were started between April 2009 and the end of July 2010. These included more than 1.3 million trial Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) modification starts, more than 510,000 Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loss mitigation and early delinquency interventions, and nearly 1.6 million proprietary modifications under HOPE Now. The number of agreements offered continued to more than double foreclosure completions for the same period (1.24 million). More than 468,000 permanent modifications granted to homeowners; more than 33,000 homeowners received a HAMP permanent modification in August. In addition, servicers continue to work aggressively through their backlog of pending modifications, which is expected to decline in coming months. Homeowners in permanent HAMP modifications have a median monthly payment reduction of 36 percent, or more than $500 per month. Homeowners in permanent modifications saw their median first-lien housing expenses fall from nearly 45 percent of their monthly household income to 31 percent.

The $143.4 million loan is made possible through the Federal Housing Administration's (FHA) Section 242 Hospital Mortgage Insurance Program.
A primary purpose of the new facility is to relieve overcrowding at the University of New Mexico Hospital (UNMH). UNMH obtained a $183.4 million Section 242 FHA-insured loan in 2004 and is now faced with a medical/surgical occupancy of 110 percent.
The new project will include construction of a new, 200,000 square foot, 68-bed hospital and a 40,000 square foot connected medical office building. The SRMC project will be a start-up, state-of-the-art, community teaching hospital with a high surgical case load.
""FHA is helping to build state-of-the-art health care facilities like this all across the country,"" said FHA Commissioner David Stevens. ""By helping to make these projects possible, FHA also contributes to the financial well-being of communities by creating jobs to stimulate local economies.""
HUD estimates the Sandoval Regional Medical Center construction project will support 1,877 full-time jobs and provide an estimated economic stimulus of more than $386 million to the community. Once completed, it is estimated the project will support 1,521full-time jobs and provide an annual economic benefit of more than $253 million.
The hospital will provide inpatient and outpatient services including cardiology, gastroenterology, general medicine, general surgery, orthopedics, oncology, pulmonary, and behavioral health. In addition to the inpatient beds, the hospital will have six operating rooms and a 13-bay Emergency Department/trauma center. Emphasis will be placed on developing an orthopedic joint replacement program. Typical ancillary support services will be provided. Space will also be provided for clinical teaching.
By insuring the mortgage loan, FHA is enabling the hospital to obtain lower cost financing that will save an estimated $64.7 million in interest expense over the life of the loan. Since 1968, FHA has insured 386 mortgages to hospitals throughout the nation, 45 within the past five years.
SRMC will be physically located on 18 acres of land, currently owned by UNM. This site is adjacent to the UNM West campus and the Rio Rancho Campus of Central New Mexico Community College. The hospital footprint is designed to eventually accommodate a 300-bed facility.
FHA's Section 242 Mortgage Insurance Program for Hospitals provides HUD-insured mortgages made by private lending institutions to finance construction or renovation of acute care hospitals including major equipment needed to operate the facility. Eligible applicants can be public, proprietary, or nonprofit hospitals certified by the responsible State agency."

Existing operations of the Hospital include: 24-hour emergency room, urgent care, homecare, gastroenterology, internal medicine, laboratory services, inpatient medical and surgical care, outpatient medical and surgical care, radiology, respiratory services, rehabilitation (physical, occupational and speech therapies) and a wellness center.
Approximately $22.6 million of the new mortgage proceeds will be used to refinance Series 2004 variable rate demand bonds. The purpose of the 2004 issue was to replace a large portion of the Hospital's physical plant (including the medical/surgical unit, OB department, radiology department, emergency room, and reception/registration area), purchase equipment, and refinance debt (a 2003 bond issue, also used for capital projects).
By insuring the mortgage loan, FHA is enabling the hospital to obtain lower cost financing that will save an estimated $14 million in interest expense over the life of the loan. Since 1968, FHA has insured 386 mortgages to hospitals throughout the nation, 45 within the past five years.

The funding is provided through The Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing Program (HUD-VASH), a coordinated effort by HUD, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and local housing authorities to provide permanent supportive housing for veterans experiencing homelessness. For a local breakdown of the rental vouchers announced today, visit HUD's website.
""Our veterans deserve something better than a life on the streets,"" said Donovan. ""President Obama has given us our marching orders that, as a nation, we must end the curse of homelessness especially for those who answered their country's call to serve.""
This funding to local housing authorities is part of the Obama Administration's strategy to end veteran and long-term chronic homelessness by 2015. Opening Doors: Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness (www.usich.gov/PDF/FactSheetVeterans.pdf) serves as a roadmap for how the federal government will work with state and local agreements to confront the root causes of homelessness, especially among former servicemen and women.
The grants announced today are part of a $75 million investment to support the needs of homeless veterans. With today's announcement, HUD will have allocated a combined $70 million to fund 9,800 housing vouchers nationwide for 2010. The fourth and final competitive round will be announced later this year or early 2011. In addition to the rental assistance, the VA Medical Centers provide supportive services and case management to eligible homeless veterans.
HUD allocates the housing vouchers to local public housing agencies, which work closely with local Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMC) to target rental assistance vouchers to homeless veterans in their area. Homeless veterans are selected based on a variety of factors, including the number of reported homeless veterans and the proximity of a local VAMC with the capacity to provide case management. Veteran Affairs case managers will also work directly with local housing agencies that are administering the HUD-VASH program to determine income eligibility and help participants find suitable housing.

Public housing authorities across the U.S. will distribute approximately 4,300 rental assistance vouchers to this population.
HUD is awarding nearly $33 million to fund these vouchers through its Rental Assistance for Non-Elderly Persons with Disabilities Program. For a local breakdown of the rental vouchers announced today, see attached chart.
The grants announced today are part of the $40 million HUD made available last April to help public housing authorities across the country fund rental vouchers for non-elderly persons with disabilities. PHAs could apply for funding under the following categories:
Category I - These vouchers will be used by non-elderly individuals with disabilities and their families access affordable housing in a community that adequately meets their needs. Today's announcement is for this category. Category II - Up to 1,000 vouchers will be specifically targeted for non-elderly individuals with disabilities currently living in nursing homes and other health care institutions move into the community with rental assistance. This category will be announced later this year.

• Category II - Up to 1,000 vouchers will be specifically targeted for non-elderly individuals with disabilities currently living in nursing homes and other health care institutions move into the community with rental assistance. This category will be announced later this year.
Last year, as part of President Obama's Year of Community Living initiative, HUD and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) launched a joint effort to provide housing support for non-elderly persons with disabilities. The interagency collaboration is intended to allow persons with disabilities to live productive independent lives in their communities rather than in institutional settings. This announcement represents the first phase of the joint effort."
10/01/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-215.cfm,HUD Charges New York Landlord with Discriminating Against a Tenant with Disabilities,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced that it is charging Heatherwood-Norwich Gate LLC, the owner and manager of an apartment complex in East Norwich, New York, with violating the Fair Housing Act for allegedly denying a resident with disabilities an accessible parking space he requested. HUD's charge also alleges that the complex refused to modify its first-come, first-served parking policy to accommodate the resident's request.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to refuse to make reasonable accommodations when they are needed to afford persons with disabilities the opportunity to use and enjoy their homes.
""Housing providers have a legal obligation to modify their policies and practices for persons with disabilities,"" stated John Trasviña, Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will vigorously enforce legal protections that help ensure that persons with disabilities have full access to their homes.""
The resident suffers from peripheral vascular and coronary artery disease and a non-healing wound in his foot, rendering him unable to walk long distances. According to HUD's charge, the resident informed the managers of his building of his condition and repeatedly asked for an assigned accessible parking space, but they denied his requests, citing their policy against designating spaces for residents.
The HUD charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to aggrieved persons for the damages caused them by the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief to deter further discrimination, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose fines in order to vindicate the public interest. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages to aggrieved persons.
FHEO and its partners in the Fair Housing Assistance Program investigate more than 10,000 housing discrimination complaints annually. People who believe they are the victims of housing discrimination should contact HUD at 1-800-669-9777 (voice), 800-927-9275 (TTY)."

The entire $250 million, awarded nationally, is now dedicated to developments to provide nearly 20,000 homes around the country with energy efficient upgrades. In addition to the green improvements, the green retrofit grants and loans will also create jobs, and reduce utility consumption by more than 25 percent on average, saving these low-income properties $12 million annually on utility bills.
HUD's Green Retrofit Program for Multifamily Housing, created for the first time through the Recovery Act, provided 221 projects around the country with awards to reduce utility consumption, cut water consumption, improve indoor air quality, and generate savings for tens of thousands of affordable housing residents.
""The speed and efficiency at which these funds were awarded and put to use on the ground is an example of how, through the Recovery Act, HUD is committed to creating quality green jobs quickly, while also building sustainable homes and communities across the country,"" said Secretary Donovan. ""This achievement represents one of many milestones to come from the Recovery Act that will provide a real, long-term impact for American families and communities.""
The Green Retrofit Program will create thousands of green jobs as workers retrofit older federally assisted multi-family apartment developments with the next generation of energy efficient technologies. Grants and loans provided through this program help private landlords and property management companies to cut heating and air conditioning costs such as by installing more efficient heating and cooling systems, and to reduce water use such as by replacing faucets and toilets. These Recovery Act funds will also produce other environmental benefits by encouraging the use of recycled building materials, reflective roofing, and non-toxic products to reduce 'off-gassing' of potentially harmful fumes. Funds have been awarded to owners of HUD-assisted housing projects to be used for a wide range of retrofit activities, ranging from windows/doors to solar panels and geothermal installation.
The Recovery Act included $13.61 billion for projects and programs administered by HUD, nearly 75 percent of which was allocated to state and local recipients only eight days after President Obama signed the Act into law. The remaining 25 percent was awarded through competitive grant programs, including the Green Retrofit Program. To date, 100 percent of HUD's Recovery Act grant funds are in the hands of local communities, being used to improve housing and neighborhoods, while creating jobs. HUD is committed to implementing Recovery Act investments swiftly and effectively as they generate tens of thousands of jobs, modernize homes to make them energy efficient, and help the families and communities hardest hit by the economic crisis.
In addition, Secretary Donovan and the Department are committed to providing the highest level of transparency possible as Recovery Act funds are administered. It is vitally important that the American people are fully aware of how their tax dollars are being spent and can hold their federal leaders accountable. Every dollar of Recovery Act funds HUD spends can be reviewed and tracked at HUD's Recovery Act website. The full text of HUD's funding notices and tracking of future performance of these grants is also available at HUD's Recovery Act website."

10/05/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-225.cfm,Obama Administration Announces $1 Billion in Additional Help for Struggling Homeowners in 32 States and Puerto Rico,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan today announced today $1 billion to help struggling homeowners in 32 states and Puerto Rico stay in their homes. Funded through HUD's new Emergency Homeowners Loan Program (EHLP), families experiencing unemployment or a reduction in income can receive a zero-percent loan to help them pay their mortgage (see attached list for states awarded funding).
Signed into law by President Obama in July, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act authorizes HUD to administer a $1 billion Emergency Homeowners Loan Program nationwide. EHLP provides up to 24 months of assistance to homeowners who have experienced a substantial reduction in income due to involuntary unemployment, underemployment, or a medical condition and are at-risk of foreclosure.HUD will assist borrowers in these 32 states and Puerto Rico not otherwise funded by Treasury's Hardest Hit Housing Fund program, based on the state's relative share of unemployed homeowners. It is HUD's intention for the program to begin taking applications from eligible homeowners by the end of the year.
""The Emergency Homeowner Loan Program will provide limited and targeted assistance to help working families get back on their feet and keep their home while they look for work,"" said Donovan. ""In crafting this new loan program, HUD built on the lessons learned from Treasury's Hardest Hit initiative to design and implement a program to assist struggling unemployed homeowners avoid preventable foreclosures. Together these two initiatives represent a combined $8.6 billion investment to help struggling borrowers and in doing so further contribute to the Obama Administration's efforts to stabilize housing markets and communities across the country.""
Who Will Be Helped
The program will complement existing Administration efforts to assist struggling homeowners - including the Home Affordable Modification and Hardest Hit Fund initiative administered by the U.S. Treasury Department. Under the EHLP:
• Borrowers must be at least three months delinquent in their payments and have a reasonable likelihood of being able to resume repayment of their mortgage payments and related housing expenses within two years;
• The property must be the principle residence of the borrower, and eligible borrowers may not own a second home; and
• The borrower must have suffered at least a 15 percent reduction in income and have been able to afford their mortgage payments prior to the event that triggered the loss income.
How Families Will Be Helped
HUD's Emergency Homeowners Loan Program will offer up to $50,000 in a forgivable, deferred payment ""bridge loan"" (zero percent interest, non-recourse, subordinate loans) to assist eligible borrowers with their mortgage arrearages and payments on their for mortgage principal, interest, mortgage insurance premiums, taxes and hazard insurance for up to 24 months.
There will be a dual delivery approach for program administration. The first approach will delegate some of the program's administrative functions to a designated third party. The second approach will enable state housing finance agencies (HFAs) that operate substantially similar programs to engage in relief efforts on behalf of residents of their state:
Delegated approach: HUD will delegate key program administration functions to NeighborWorks® America - an experienced and highly regarded national network of affiliated housing counseling agencies. Under the program, nonprofit housing counselors who are part of the National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program administered by NeighborWorks® America will coordinate intake counseling, document preparation and outreach functions. HUD will also use it delegation authority to contract with an experienced entity to provide loan servicing and fiscal control functions such as collecting payments from homeowners, distributing payments to servicers, and managing loan balances.
Substantially similar state law approach: State HFAs that operate loan assistance programs that are determined by HUD to be substantially similar to the EHLP will receive allocations to fund emergency loans for borrowers in their states as well as payments to cover the administrative costs of performing the intake and housing counseling and fiscal agent functions (described above) directly or indirectly through subcontracts with third parties."

Riley will serve as HUD's liaison to mayors, city managers, elected representatives, state and local officials, congressional delegations, stakeholders and customers. He will be responsible for overseeing the delivery of HUD programs and services to communities, as well as evaluating their efficiency and effectiveness.
""Antonio is an experienced, dedicated public servant who has been intimately involved in economic development and housing issues in the low to moderate income communities for years,"" said Secretary Donovan. ""His skill set and the fact that his most recent focus was to develop new strategies that increase jobs, make homeownership sustainable and affordable, renew and invigorate depressed neighborhoods, make him the perfect pick for this region at this time.""

10/07/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-229.cfm,HUD Charges Iowa Landlords with Sexual Harassment of Women Tenants,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced that it is charging Waterloo, Iowa, apartment complex Elders, Inc., employee Michael Nieman, and J.S. Property Management L.C. with housing discrimination for allegedly harassing female tenants through repeated unwanted sexual comments and advances. HUD alleges that property manager Nieman requested sexual favors in exchange for rent or other housing benefits.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing discrimination based on race, sex, color, national origin, disability, religion and familial status, including the sexual harassment of tenants.
""Sexual harassment by housing providers is especially pernicious as it makes its targets feel uncomfortable and afraid to live in the place they call home,"" stated John Trasviña, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Harassment victims are not alone in the fight to protect their housing rights. HUD works vigorously to enforce their right to live free from discrimination.""
According to HUD's Charge, Nieman repeatedly made unwelcome and offensive sexual comments and gestures toward two women residing at the property he managed, Park Tower Apartments, suggesting that they could exchange sex for rent, cable service, and other housing services. The Charge concludes that Nieman's actions were sufficiently severe and pervasive to unreasonably interfere with the women's tenancy and cause them emotional distress, economic loss, and other damages. The two women eventually moved from the apartment complex.
The HUD charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he or she may award damages to aggrieved persons for the damages they suffered because of the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief to deter further discrimination, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose fines in order to vindicate the public interest. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages to aggrieved persons.
FHEO and its partners in the Fair Housing Assistance Program investigate more than 10,000 housing discrimination complaints annually. People who believe they are the victims of housing discrimination should contact HUD at 1-800-669-9777 (voice), 800-927-9275 (TTY)."
10/08/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-230.cfm,HUD Proposes to Strengthen FHA Lender Indemnification Process,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today proposed new regulations to strengthen its authority to force certain lenders to indemnify or reimburse the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) for insurance claims paid on mortgages that are found not to meet the agency's guidelines. In addition, HUD's proposed rule would require all new and existing lenders with the ability to insure mortgages on HUD's behalf (""Lender Insurance"" mortgagee) to meet stricter performance standards to gain and maintain their approval status.
Last January, FHA announced a series of policy changes to address risk and strengthen the financial position of its insurance fund. Today's announcement will create a regulatory framework and codify the legal authority FHA currently has under the National Housing Act. To read the full text of FHA's proposed rule, visit HUD's website.
""It's important that our expectations are crystal clear,"" said FHA Commissioner David H. Stevens. ""We need to clarify which circumstances we'll require indemnification and the level of loan performance we expect lenders to maintain.""
For those lenders with special authority to insure mortgage loans on FHA's behalf, HUD seeks to force indemnification for 'serious and material' violations of FHA origination requirements such that the mortgage never should have been endorsed by the mortgagee in the first place just as FHA would not have insured the mortgage on its own.
Specifically, these lenders may be required to indemnify HUD if they failed to: (1) verify and analyze the creditworthiness, income, and/or employment of the borrower; (2) verify the source of assets brought by the borrower for payment of the required downpayment and/or closing costs; (3) address property deficiencies identified in the appraisal affecting the health and safety of the occupants or the structural integrity of the property; or (4) ensure that the property appraisal satisfies FHA appraisal requirements. HUD may seek indemnification irrespective of whether the violation caused the mortgage default.
While HUD will seek indemnification in cases of fraud or misrepresentation at any time, the Department intends to codify a 'reasonable time period' for requiring indemnification in cases where the mortgagee failed to meet FHA requirements. For those cases not involving fraud or misrepresentation, it has been HUD's long-standing practice of requiring indemnification ""within five years from the date of mortgage insurance endorsement."" The date of endorsement is a fixed date, and therefore has the benefit of being known to both HUD and the lenders with the authority to self insure mortgages. HUD believes five years is a reasonable ""seasoning"" period for a particular mortgage loan to either perform or go into default and for the Department to ascertain whether origination errors were made. In addition, this five-year period is not considered a burden to lenders who might otherwise face the possibility of indemnifying insurance claims made on long-ago endorsed mortgage loans.
Tightening Performance Standards
The proposed rule will also require those mortgagees with delegated lender insurance authority to continually maintain an acceptable claim and default rate, both to gain this special lender status as well as to preserve it. HUD proposes that all new unconditional direct endorsement lenders who have the authority to self-insure mortgages must demonstrate a default and claim rate at or below 150 percent for the previous two years. This standard would apply to the state/states where the lender does business, rather than a national default/claim average.
The present regulation defines an acceptable claim and default as at or below 150 percent of either: (1) the national average rate for all insured mortgages; or (2) if the mortgagee operates in a single state, the average rate for insured mortgages in the state.
The current regulation may make it easier for a single-state lender to meet the acceptable standard if that lender operates in a state that has a high default rate. In contrast, a mortgagee would be disadvantaged by having its claim and default rate compared to the national average if the mortgagee operates in states with comparatively high default rates, even if the mortgagee is in full compliance with FHA requirements and otherwise eligible for ""Lender Insurance"" approval. HUD believes the proposed methodology will more accurately reflect mortgagee performance by evaluating each mortgagee based on its actual area of operations. FHA will continually monitor lender performance rather than conduct an annual review of each ""Lender Insurance"" mortgagee.
Finally, the FHA will consider the two-year default and claim performance of either entity in the case of acquisition or merger without requiring these entities to seek a waiver. FHA, at its own discretion (without any judicial or administrative action) also clarifies that it has the authority to immediately withdraw a lender's ability to self-insure mortgage loans."
10/08/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-231.cfm,"HUD Makes $35 Million Available to Housing Authorities to Create New Educational, Job Training Facilities for Residents","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is offering $35 million to public housing authorities to develop facilities that will provide early childhood and adult education, and/or job training programs for public housing residents. The new Capital Fund Education and Training Community Facilities Program (CFCF) further illustrates the Obama Administrations commitment to link affordable housing with education reform and early childhood education. The Notice of Funding for CFCF was posted on Grants.gov today.
""ducation offers a path to a better life,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""This new program will provide public housing authorities the necessary resources to give their residents educational and enrichment opportunities that will open doors to boundless opportunities.""
Housing authorities have until January 14, 2011, to apply for CFCF funding to construct new facilities, rehabilitate existing structures or purchase facilities that will provide early childhood and adult education, and/or job training programs for public housing residents based on an identified need. The funding can also be used to revitalize an existing community center that will offer comprehensive integrated services to help public housing residents achieve better educational and economic outcomes resulting in long-term economic self-sufficiency. While use of the facility is primarily for public housing residents, families in the community may utilize and benefit from the new centers and their resources.
The maximum grant award is $5 million. Applicants must leverage or have financial commitments of at least five percent of the grant amount and identify at least one education or training supportive service provider, such as a community college, that will partner with the housing authority to provide the services required. Agencies that are awarded funding are given four years to have an operating facility.
CFCF, which is being funded though a special set-aside from HUDs Capital Fund Program, adds to the Obama Administrations commitment to including educational components to its housing programs. Both the Choice Neighborhoods (CN) and HOPE VI Revitalization Programs, that are currently taking applications, require providing early childhood educational opportunities a priority.
The Choice Neighborhoods initiative aligns quality educational opportunities with community development resources for long-term, economically viable neighborhood transformation. Now in its pilot year, the competitive program will award up to $65 million to public housing authorities, local governments, nonprofit organizations, and for profit developers that apply jointly with a public entity to extend neighborhood transformation efforts beyond public and/or assisted housing, to link housing revitalization with education reform and early childhood education. CN builds on the success of the HOPE VI Revitalization Program that has for nearly 20 years transformed neighborhoods with distressed public housing into revitalized mixed-income communities."

10/13/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-235.cfm,"HUD, FEMA Extend Disaster Housing Assistance Program for Louisiana and Texas Gustav/Ike Survivors until March 2011","WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan and Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Craig Fugate announced today an additional extension to the Disaster Housing Assistance Program-Ike (DHAP-Ike), giving families in Texas and Louisiana who were displaced by Hurricanes Ike and Gustav until March 31, 2011 to transition to permanent housing solutions.
This extension will give the 6,000 families who continue to participate in the program an additional five months to transition from the program. The DHAP program has provided temporary rental assistance to families since November 2008, and was scheduled to end on October 31, 2010.
""Two years have passed since families in Texas and parts of Louisiana were devastated by Hurricanes Ike and Gustav,"" said Secretary Donovan. ""Thankfully the housing assistance and case management that DHAP-Ike provides will continue to be the safety net for these families as they continue rebuilding their lives.""
""This extension will continue to help thousands of families who were uprooted from their homes during Hurricanes Gustav and Ike cover their rent payments as they continue to look for permanent housing,"" said Administrator Craig Fugate. ""Our partnership with HUD is another example of FEMA's commitment to working across the federal family, with all members of the nation's emergency management team, to support the recovery needs of residents and communities.""
HUD and FEMA established the program through an Inter-Agency Agreement to assist homeowners and renters who were displaced by Hurricanes Gustav and Ike with up to 17 months of temporary housing assistance and case management. FEMA and HUD have extended the program to allow an additional 12 months of potential program eligibility based on the States of Louisiana and Texas requests. This new extension will allow FEMA and HUD to continue supporting the remaining families in DHAP in Texas and Louisiana as they transition to more permanent housing.
This program provided full rental payments to participating families for the first six months. On May 1, 2009, families began paying $50 towards the rent. Each month thereafter, the tenant's portion of the rent increased by $50 until the tenant began paying the full rent or ended their participation in the program. The incremental rent payments will continue during this extension period. After May 2009, families whose housing expenses - rent and mortgage for personal residences that remained uninhabitable - exceeded 30 percent of their post-disaster income, and who also met other program requirements, continued receiving DHAP-Ike assistance. DHAP-Ike subsidized eligible families' rent anywhere in the U.S.

10/14/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-233.cfm,HUD Awards Nearly $100 Million in New Grants to Promote Smarter and Sustainable Planning for Jobs and Economic Growth,"WASHINGTON - For the first time ever, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is awarding nearly $100 million in new grants to support more livable and sustainable communities across the country. HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan today announced that 45 regional areas will receive funding through a new initiative intended to build economic competitiveness by connecting housing with good jobs, quality schools and transportation.
HUD's new Sustainable Communities Regional Planning Grant Program will support State, local, and tribal governments, as well as metropolitan planning organizations, in the development and execution of regional plans that integrate affordable housing with neighboring retail and business development (see attached list of grantees). Many of the grants will leverage existing infrastructure and all reward local collaboration and innovation.
""Regions that embrace sustainable communities will have a built-in competitive edge in attracting jobs and private investment,"" said Donovan. ""Planning our communities smarter means parents will spend less time driving and more time with their children; more families will live in safe, stable communities near good schools and jobs; and more businesses will have access to the capital and talent they need to grow and prosper. In awarding these grants we were committed to using insight and innovation from our stakeholders and local partners to develop a 'bottom-up' approach to changing federal policy as opposed to 'top-down.' Rather than sticking to the old Washington playbook of dictating how communities can invest their grants, HUD's application process encouraged creative, locally focused thinking.""
These grants are part of the Obama Administration's Partnership for Sustainable Communities, which brings HUD, the U.S. Department of Transportation, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency together to ensure that the agencies' policies, programs, and funding consider affordable housing, transportation, and environmental protection together. This interagency collaboration gets better results for communities and uses taxpayer money more efficiently. Coordinating federal investments in infrastructure, facilities, and services meets multiple economic, environmental, and community objectives with each dollar spent. The Partnership is helping communities across the country to create more housing choices, make transportation more efficient and reliable, reinforce existing investments, and support vibrant and healthy neighborhoods that attract businesses. At a time when every dollar the federal government invests in jumpstarting the economy is critical, the President's plan ensures that all these agencies are coordinating efforts and targeting resources with precision. Reflecting this new collaboration, these grants were judged by a multidisciplinary review team, drawn from eight federal agencies and from partners in philanthropy.
HUD's inaugural grants under this program will support metropolitan and multi-jurisdictional planning efforts that incorporate housing, land use, economic development, transportation and infrastructure. This holistic planning approach will benefit diverse areas across the U.S. including $25.6 million split evenly between regions with populations less than 500,000 and rural places (fewer than 200,000 people). HUD is reserving $2 million to help all of these areas build the needed capacity to execute their plans.
The grants are awarded through one of two categories. One category of grants will assist regional planning for sustainable development where such plans do not currently exist. A second category of funding will support the implementation of existing sustainability plans.
Shelley Poticha, the director of HUD's new Office of Sustainable Housing and Communities said, ""The response to this program is huge. We were inundated with applications from every state and two territories - from central cities to rural areas and tribal governments. This program was designed by people from local government, and incorporated local input at every stage.""

10/14/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-237.cfm,HUD Charges Florida Landlords with Discriminating Against African-American Family,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced that it is charging the owners of a single-family home in Gibsonton, Florida with violating the Fair Housing Act for engaging in discriminatory housing practices, including reneging on their agreement to rent the house to a mother and her children because they are African American. HUD's charge also alleges that the owners used racial slurs when referring to and addressing the family.
The Fair Housing Act makes it illegal to, among other things, discriminate because of race or color in the rental of housing, make discriminatory statements with respect to the rental of housing, or coerce, intimidate, threaten, or interfere with others in their exercise or enjoyment of their right to fair housing.
""Discrimination does not deserve a home in America,"" said John Trasviña, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""All Families have a right to live wherever they choose without being subjected to unfair treatment.""
HUD's investigation found that Robert and Katherine Cairns initially agreed to rent a house they own to an African-American mother and her three minor children. Two days after the family moved in, however, Robert Cairns refused to accept their rent payment, ordered the children out of the house while their mother was at work, and changed the locks on the house. The children were later found by a relative about a quarter of a mile from the house, under a highway underpass.
When the mother contacted the local police to report the incident and regain access to the house, Mrs. Cairns allegedly said, ""I can't believe you ['n-word']s called the police on me. You ['n-word]s make me sick. I just want you ['n-word']s out of my house."" The Cairns subsequently rented the house to another tenant.
The HUD charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court.

The median monthly cost of housing in the Seattle metro area was $1,320 in 2009 compared to the national median of $922. This places the Seattle metropolitan area at the 70th percentile nationwide in monthly housing costs. HUD's survey also found that in 2009, more than 84 percent of Seattle-area homes had at least two bedrooms and nearly 60 percent had three or more. In addition, more than 99 percent of homes had more than one bathroom and more than half contained two or more.
HUD's data files are intended for use by economists, housing analysts and others in the research community. The Census Bureau expects to release a more comprehensive narrative report on these data later this fall."
10/18/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-241.cfm,HUD Charges Mississippi Property Manager and Owner with Race Discrimination,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced that it is charging Vicksburg, Mississippi, rental property owner Richard Cowart and his property manager, Janie Kelly, with violating the Fair Housing Act by refusing to renew the lease of a white tenant at Shamrock Apartments because the tenant associated with African Americans and has a biracial daughter. The HUD charge also alleges the property manager made discriminatory statements about renting to African Americans and tenants associating with African Americans.
The Fair Housing Act makes it illegal to discriminate in housing because of race or color, which includes making discriminatory statements with respect to the rental of a dwelling.
""No one should be denied a place to live because of the race of their family members or friends,"" said John Trasviña, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD is committed to ending housing discrimination in all forms and in all places.""
Specifically, HUD's charge alleges that after Ms. Kelly discovered that an African-American man had visited a tenant's apartment, Kelly informed the tenant that she was not permitted to have visitors who were not listed on her lease. Two months later, after a neighbor called the police when he saw an African-American man knocking on the tenant's door, Kelly notified the tenant that her lease would not be renewed.
The charge further alleges that Kelly told a prospective tenant that she was trying to ""weed out"" all the black people to make the apartment complex a ""better place"" to live. In addition, a resident told a HUD investigator that Kelly told her that she did not like renting to black people, especially black men, because all they did was cause trouble and because she wanted the white women living at Shamrock to feel safe living there.
The HUD Charge of Discrimination will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) unless any party to the Charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an ALJ finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, the judge may award damages to the aggrieved persons for the damages caused them by the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief to deter further discrimination, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose fines in order to vindicate the public interest. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages to the aggrieved persons.
FHEO and its partners in the Fair Housing Assistance Program investigate more than 10,000 housing discrimination complaints annually. People who believe they are the victims of housing discrimination should contact HUD at 1-800-669-9777 (voice), 800-927-9275 (TTY).

10/20/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-242.cfm,HUD and DOT Award $68 Million to Create Sustainable Livable Communities,"WASHINGTON - In an unprecedented collaboration between two federal agencies, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) today jointly awarded nearly $68 million to help stimulate a new generation of sustainable and livable communities that connect housing, employment and economic development with transportation and other infrastructure improvements. The joint HUD-DOT funding will support 62 local and regional partnerships seeking to create a more holistic and integrated approach to connecting affordable housing, job opportunities and transportation corridors.
HUD is awarding $40 million in new Sustainable Community Challenge Grants to help support local planning designed to integrate affordable housing, good jobs and public transportation. Meanwhile, DOT is awarding nearly $28 million in TIGER (Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery) II Planning Grants (www.dot.gov/affairs/2010/dot18810.html) to implement localized plans that ultimately lead to projects that integrate transportation, housing and economic development (see attached funding chart).
""Today two federal agencies come together to produce a win-win for local communities around the country,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""We're helping local and regional planners connect all the dots in their efforts to make their communities more sustainable and livable. These grants will help communities to hit on all cylinders, producing more affordable housing near good jobs and commercial centers which will help to reduce our energy consumption and increase competitiveness.""
DOT Secretary Ray LaHood said, ""With the investments HUD and DOT are making today, we are strengthening neighborhoods by connecting housing with affordable and sustainable transportation choices. This is a win-win for people who live in these communities because they will have travel options to better serve them.""
HUD's Sustainable Communities Challenge Grants will foster reform and reduce barriers to achieving affordable, economically vital and sustainable communities. These funds will be used by communities, large and small, to address local challenges to integrating transportation and housing. When these activities are done in conjunction with transportation projects, they can greatly increase the efficiency and access of local transportation while encouraging mixed-use or transit-oriented development. Such efforts may include amending or updating local master plans, zoning codes, and building codes to support private sector investment in mixed-use development, affordable housing and the re-use of older buildings. Other local efforts may include retrofitting main streets to provide safer routes for children and seniors, or preserving affordable housing and local businesses near new transit stations.
TIGER II Planning Grants will prepare or design surface transportation projects that would be eligible for funding under the TIGER II Discretionary Grant program. These projects include highways, bridges, transit, railways, ports or bicycle and pedestrian facilities. For more information on DOT's TIGER II Planning Grants, visit DOT's website (www.dot.gov/affairs/2010/dot18810.html).
Rather than require applicants to navigate two separate grant application procedures that might be on different timelines and with different requirements, HUD and DOT joined their two new discretionary planning programs to create one point of entry to federal resources for local, innovative sustainable community planning projects.
The Community Challenge grants compliment the 45 Sustainable Communities Regional Grants announced last week by HUD. The Challenge Grants help to support local communities seeking to integrate housing, transportation, and environmental strategies that will enhance local economic development, provide greater housing and transportation choices, and develop long-range visions for how they want their community to grow.
The new HUD-DOT program also builds on the Partnership for Sustainable Communities, an innovative new interagency collaboration, launched by President Obama in June 2009, between the Department of Transportation (DOT), the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Guided by six Livability Principles, the Partnership is designed to remove the traditional federal government silos that exist between departments and strategically target the agencies' transportation, land use, environmental, housing and community development resources to provide communities the resources they need to build more livable, sustainable communities."
10/21/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-243.cfm,Partnership for Sustainable Communities Awards Grants to Build Infrastructure Nationwide,"WASHINGTON - Today at the National Press Club, administration officials highlighted recent grants released by the Partnership for Sustainable Communities (www.epa.gov/smartgrowth/pdf/partnership_year1.pdf) to support more livable and sustainable communities across the country. The Partnership - which consists of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) - builds economic competitiveness by connecting housing with good jobs, transportation, and more. Last week, agencies began releasing local grants to support sustainable living nationwide. The combined sum of the agencies' grants is $409.5 million.
""We're working to change the way government works, and that means investing tax dollars wisely and well,"" President Obama said in a statement. ""We want to make sure that when we're building infrastructure, we're considering how housing, transportation, and the environment all impact each other. These grants are designed to get the biggest bang for our tax dollar buck.""
Over the past year, HUD, DOT, and EPA have worked together to promote better outcomes for communities and more effective federal investments through better targeted federal resources, removal of existing federal regulatory and policy barriers to smart and sustainable development, as well as aligned agency priorities that will ensure lasting collaboration.
""These grants will help boost economic development with the goal that all Americans can afford to live in communities with access to employment, schools and transportation options,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""Communities across the country offered bold, unique proposals to plan and build sustainably based on their own local resources, landscape, culture and ingenuity. With this partnership we can lay the foundation for sustainable economic prosperity for generations to come by helping communities that share problems start sharing solutions.""
Coordinating federal investments in infrastructure, facilities, and services meets multiple economic, environmental, and community objectives with each dollar spent. The Partnership is helping communities across the country to create more housing choices, make transportation more efficient and reliable, reinforce existing investments, and support vibrant and healthy neighborhoods that attract businesses.
""These investments represent an unprecedented new way of working together. And they set a powerful example for how we can reward true excellence, effective partnerships, and the good stewardship of taxpayer dollars,"" said Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood. ""Americans can rebuild their communities - not just in spite of enormous economic challenges, but as the means for overcoming them.""
At a time when every dollar the federal government invests in jumpstarting the economy is critical, the President's plan ensures that all these agencies are coordinating efforts and targeting resources with precision. This collaboration gets better results for communities and uses taxpayer money more efficiently. Reflecting this new collaboration, these grants were judged by a multidisciplinary review team, drawn from eight federal agencies and from partners in philanthropy.
""President Obama has made clear that sustainable communities with affordable housing and access to a broad range of transportation options are vital to rebuilding the foundation for prosperity in this country,"" EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson said. ""This Partnership is bringing our efforts together, allowing our resources to have more impact, and ensuring that we are collaborating on the housing, transportation and environmental needs that are essential to the success of every community. Our work has already helped to create healthier communities and open up better opportunities to attract new jobs and investments.""

10/21/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-244.cfm,HUD Charges Wisconsin Property Managers with Discriminating Against a Family Because They Have Children,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced that it has charged Sharlene and Jerald Kuiper, managers of a three-bedroom duplex apartment in Outagamie County, Wisconsin, and the owner of the apartment, Kuiper Family Trust, with violating the Fair Housing Act by refusing to show an available apartment to a family with children. HUD's charge alleges that the Kuipers falsely asserted that the unit was unavailable for viewing when it was, offered to show units only after families without children rejected them, and made discriminatory statements demonstrating a preference for renters without children.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing discrimination based on family status, including making statements that indicate a preference for renters without children or a limitation against families with children.
""For 22 years, the Fair Housing Act has made it illegal to refuse housing to families with children,"" said John Trasviña, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Families with children are guaranteed the same rights to housing as those without children and HUD will continue to take swift enforcement action against individuals and housing providers who violate those rights.""
According to HUD's charge, the father of three young children responded to an advertisement for the three-bedroom apartment managed by the Kuipers. When the father told Ms. Kuiper that he and his wife had children, Ms. Kuiper allegedly refused to show him the available apartment. Later, the man's wife, interested in seeing what would happen, called Ms. Kuiper and claimed that she and her husband had no children and were interested in viewing the same apartment her husband had called about earlier. Ms. Kuiper immediately scheduled a showing and pressured her to see the unit right away.
The couple subsequently contacted the Metropolitan Milwaukee Fair Housing Council, a non-profit fair housing organization, which had testers contact the Kuipers and express an interest in the apartment. During the telephone tests, the Kuipers allegedly made discriminatory statements about renting to families. Ms. Kuiper allegedly told one tester, ""I'm looking for the perfect renter, meaning I don't want a lot of kids."" Mr. Kuiper allegedly told the same tester that he charges families with children higher security deposits. The Kuipers eventually rented the apartment to two men with no children.
The HUD Charge of Discrimination will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) unless any party to the Charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If the ALJ finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, the judge may award damages to aggrieved persons for the harm they were caused by the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive and other equitable relief to deter further discrimination, as well as payment of attorney fees.

10/25/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-247.cfm,Obama Administration Releases October Housing Scorecard,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of the Treasury today released the October edition of the Obama Administration's Housing Scorecard. The latest housing figures show continued signs of stabilization in house prices and high home affordability due in part to record low interest rates. The housing scorecard is a comprehensive report on the nation's housing market.
""Over the last 21 months, the Obama Administration's swift action in the housing market has kept millions of families in their homes and provided responsible borrowers with incentives to refinance or to become a homeowner,"" said HUD Assistant Secretary Raphael Bostic. ""But, with many unavoidable foreclosures still in the pipeline, it's clear that we have a hard road ahead. That's why we're focused on successfully implementing the programs we've put in place - such as additional assistance on refinancing and helping unemployed homeowners stay in their homes - and ensuring that help is available to homeowners as soon as possible.""
""HAMP is not only an important part of the Administration's efforts to stabilize the housing market, it has also redefined the loan modification standard for the mortgage industry overall. That has led to more than 3.5 million modification arrangements directly benefitting families in communities across the country still healing from the crisis,"" said acting Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability Tim Massad. ""Early data shows that well beyond the trial phase, the majority of homeowners are maintaining their HAMP modifications, reflecting the rigorous standards the program uses to provide assistance to responsible homeowners.""
The October Housing Scorecard features key data on the health of the housing market including:
Families continued to benefit from the lowest rates in history on 30-year fixed mortgages. Since April of 2009, record low interest rates have helped more than 7.1 million homeowners to refinance, resulting in more stable home prices and $12.7 billion in total borrower savings. As expected with the expiration of the Homebuyer Tax Credit, new and existing home sales remained below levels seen in the first half of 2010. At the same time, home prices remained level in the past year after 33 straight months of decline and homeowners added $95 billion in home equity in the second quarter. More than 3.52 million modification arrangements were started between April 2009 and the end of August 2010 — nearly triple the number of foreclosure completions during that time. These included more than 1.3 million trial Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) modification starts, more than 510,000 Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loss mitigation and early delinquency interventions, and more than 1.6 million proprietary modifications under HOPE Now. While some homeowners may have received help from more than one program, the number of agreements offered nearly tripled foreclosure completions for the same period (1.3 million). At nine months, almost 90 percent of homeowners remain in their permanent HAMP modification, with 11 percent defaulted. Early data indicate that HAMP permanent modifications are performing well over time, with lower delinquency rates than those reported by the industry at large. At nine months, less than 16 percent of permanent modifications are 60+ days delinquent.

Data in the scorecard also show that the recovery in the housing market continues to remain fragile. For example, foreclosure completions continue to move upward and a large supply of homes are being held off the market. While the recovery will take place over time, the Administration remains committed to its efforts to prevent avoidable foreclosures and stabilize the housing market.
Each month, the Housing Scorecard incorporates key housing market indicators and highlights the impact of the Administration's unprecedented housing recovery efforts, including assistance to homeowners through the FHA and HAMP.

10/27/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-248.cfm,HUD Strengthens Protections for Victims of Domestic Violence,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan announced today new, stronger affordable housing regulations that protect victims of domestic abuse as the nation concludes National Domestic Violence Awareness Month.
To read the final regulatory requirements under the Violence against Women Act (VAWA), visit HUD's website (http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2010/pdf/2010-26914.pdf).
""This rule recognizes the need to protect victims of domestic abuse from being evicted just because they were victimized. No one should be afraid of losing their home if they report abuse,"" said Donovan. ""The Obama Administration has strengthened the existing interim regulation to further protect victims and ensures that current or former victims of domestic violence will not be turned down from HUD programs.""
""The 2009 U.S. Conference of Mayors annual report on Hunger and Homelessness identified domestic violence as the third leading cause of homelessness among families,"" said HUD Assistant Secretary Sandra Henriquez. ""This regulation protects victims housing so they are not forced to choose between staying with their abuser and becoming homeless.""
VAWA, which was enacted in 2005, provided legal protections for victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. These protections apply to families receiving rental assistance under HUD's public housing program, Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program, and multi-family project-based Section 8 program. HUD published the VAWA Interim Rule in November 2008 and allowed for public comments until January 2009.
The rule announced today addresses many concerns advocates raised with the 2008 interim rule by clarifying and aligning HUD's statutory language with VAWA; providing more detailed guidance to housing authorities and Section 8 property owners on how to implement VAWA and making a commitment to provide further guidance in the future.
For example, guidance in the new rule requires that housing authorities or management agents exhaust protective measures before eviction. Evictions can only take place after the housing or subsidy providers have taken actions that will reduce or eliminate the threat to the victim, including, transferring the abuse victim to a different home; barring the abuser from the property; contacting law enforcement to increase police presence or develop other plans to keep the property safe; or seeking other legal remedies to prevent the abuser from acting on a threat.
The new rule also broadens the definitions of ""actual and imminent threat,"" to help housing or subsidy providers understand that to use ""imminent threat"" of harm to other residents as a reason for eviction of the victim, the evidence must be real and objective - not hypothetical, presumed or speculative."
11/04/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-249.cfm,HUD and Realtors Unveil Three How-To Videos to Help Consumers Navigate the Homebuying Process,"WASHINGTON - Especially in todays housing market, the prospect of buying a home can seem overwhelming for many Americans who may not be aware of how to begin the process of shopping for a home or even a mortgage. To help consumers navigate this process, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the National Association of Realtors (NAR) today unveiled three how-to videos to help prospective homeowners find a home they can afford, shop for a mortgage they can sustain, and what to expect when they go to closing.
HUD produced the three consumer education videos in coordination with NAR and released them at the Realtors annual convention in New Orleans. Each video focuses on a critical part of the homebuying process including Shopping for your Home, Shopping for your Loan, and Closing the Deal.
David H. Stevens, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Housing and Federal Housing Commissioner said, ""The process for buying a home can appear complicated and overwhelming for many consumers. These videos will help answer the fundamental questions most people have from shopping for their home to signing on the dotted line.""
""Educating consumers about the home buying process is at the heart of what Realtors do,"" said 2010 National Association of Realtors President Vicki Cox Golder. ""Informed home buyers create the conditions necessary for responsible, sustainable home ownership, and were very happy to be a part of this project.""
HUD's videos are easily accessible from both HUD and NARs websites as well as from HUD's YouTube channel (www.youtube.com/HUDchannel). They include:
Shopping for your Home: The homebuying process obviously starts with finding a place you'll want to call home. This short video will instruct viewers on assessing how much of a home you can afford, working with a real estate agent and what happens once you find the home you want to buy. Housing counselors can assist home buyers and home owners on issues such as home buying, fair housing, credit issues, and foreclosure prevention.
Shopping for your Loan Once: You've found the home of your dreams, the next step is to shop for a mortgage loan. This video will help consumers use the good faith estimate (GFE), which is a form that spells out the terms of a loan offer, to shop for the best loan for them. Consumers will learn how to use the GFE to determine how long an interest rate is available for a particular loan and how to identify key loan terms and costs of a particular loan offer. HUD suggests consumers shop and compare GFEs from multiple mortgage brokers and/or lenders in order to get the best loan for their situation.
Closing the Deal: Finally, this video walks consumers through the actual closing process including how to make sure the loan they were offered closely matches what they encounter at the settlement table. In particular, HUD will walk the viewer through the HUD-1 Settlement Statement and demonstrate ways consumers can compare their actual costs with those reflected on their Good Faith Estimate.
Stevens added, ""These videos go a long way in identifying key aspects of the homebuying process that a consumer should be aware of. Our goal is help make the process more transparent through educating consumers who in turn can make informed choices about their home purchase. We partnered with NAR because a real estate agent is often the primary point of contact for homebuyers and we believe real estate agents are in a great position to provide these videos to their clients as they move through key areas in the homebuying process.""

11/09/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-251.cfm,HUD Announces Pilot Program to Help Homeowners Pay for Energy Improvements to Their Homes,"WASHINGTON - Vice President Joe Biden and U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Shaun Donovan today announced a new pilot program that will offer credit-worthy borrowers low-cost loans to make energy-saving improvements to their homes. Backed by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), these new FHA PowerSaver (http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2010/pdf/2010-28015.pdf) loans will offer homeowners up to $25,000 to make energy-efficient improvements of their choice, including the installation of insulation, duct sealing, doors and windows, HVAC systems, water heaters, solar panels, and geothermal systems.
HUD and FHA developed PowerSaver as part of the Recovery Through Retrofit initiative launched in May 2009 by Vice President Biden's Middle Class Task Force to develop federal actions that would expand green job opportunities in the United States and boost energy savings by improving home energy efficiency. The announcement is part of an 18-month-long interagency effort facilitated by White House Council on Environmental Quality with the Office of the Vice President, 11 departments and agencies and six White House offices.
Vice President Biden said, ""The initiatives announced today are putting the Recovery Through Retrofit report's recommendations into action - giving American families the tools they need to invest in home energy upgrades. Together, these programs will grow the home retrofit industry and help middle class families save money and energy.""
""HUD and FHA are committed to lowering the cost and expanding the availability of affordable financing for home energy retrofits,"" said Secretary Donovan. ""PowerSaver will help more homeowners afford common sense, cost saving improvements to their homes, and will create jobs for contractors, installers and energy auditors across the country.""
More homeowners are interested in making their homes energy efficient, according to industry forecasts. Yet options are still limited for financing home energy improvements, especially for the many homeowners who are unable to take out a home equity loan or access an affordable consumer loan. HUD today published a notice seeking the participation of a limited number of mortgage lenders in the two-year pilot program slated to begin in early 2011.
""PowerSaver provides lenders with a new product option to serve a potentially growing market,"" said David H. Stevens, FHA Commissioner. ""We believe there are a number of lenders who will be interested in working with us to help save energy and money for homeowners, while creating jobs and cutting greenhouse gas emissions""
Lenders will be selected to participate in the PowerSaver pilot based on their capacity and commitment to provide affordable home energy improvement financing. Lenders will be required to serve communities that have already taken affirmative steps to expand home energy improvements. HUD will help lenders identify such markets - which exist in many suburban, rural and urban areas across the country.
PowerSaver loans will be backed by the FHA - but with significant ""skin in the game"" from private lenders. FHA mortgage insurance will cover up to 90 percent of the loan amount in the event of default. Lenders will retain the remaining risk on each loan, incentivizing responsible underwriting and lending standards. FHA will provide streamlined insurance claims payment procedures on PowerSaver loans. In addition, lenders may be eligible for incentive grant payments from FHA to enhance benefits to borrowers, such as lowering interest rates.
""Home energy retrofits are good investments that save families money,"" said Ginnie Mae President Ted Tozer. ""As the financing arm of HUD, we are proud to support this important home-improvement segment of the housing market and look forward to working with lenders and FHA to develop appropriate secondary market options.""
PowerSaver has been carefully designed to meet a need in the marketplace for borrowers who have the ability and motivation to take on modest additional debt to realize the savings over time from a home energy improvement. PowerSaver loans are only available to borrowers with good credit, manageable overall debt and at least some equity in their home (maximum 100% combined loan to value).

11/15/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-253.cfm,HUD and National Community Stabilization Trust Announce $4 Million to Provide Permanent Homes to 37 Alabama Families,"MOBILE, AL - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the National Community Stabilization Trust today announced they will invest more than $4 million to provide permanent homes to 37 Alabama families who were displaced from Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The program is part of a broader effort by HUD, with the Stabilization Trust, to offer financing to acquire and rehabilitate 500 HUD homes in 11 states valued at $40 million.
HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan made the announcement at the Dotch Community Center in Mobile. For a complete listing of the properties involved in today's announcement, see attached chart.
""Today we offer 37 families in Alabama not only a new home but also a new sense of hope,"" said Donovan. ""Together, we're turning foreclosed houses into homes again and helping to stabilize communities in the process. I have no doubt we will produce the results this region needs to not only rebuild, but rebuild stronger, better and faster.""
""The Stabilization Trust is pleased to support HUD in their efforts to assist communities in need,"" said Craig Nickerson, President of the National Community Stabilization Trust. ""By improving access to flexible financing, we are helping to improve homeownership opportunity for deserving families and to renovate property in distressed communities; that's a recipe for brighter days ahead.""
Shortly after Hurricane Katrina, HUD moved quickly to freeze the sale of 1,000 single-family HUD-owned properties (HUD homes) in 11 states to help house families displaced by the storm. These families were allowed to temporarily occupy these properties rent-free. Today, five years after Katrina, approximately 500 of these homes are still occupied. In an effort to find a permanent housing solution for these families, HUD and the Stabilization Trust entered into a partnership whereby HUD will sell the homes at a 50 percent discount while the Trust, in conjunction with Enterprise Community Partners, would provide financing to rehabilitate the properties.
In Alabama, HUD and the Stabilization Trust will invest a combined $4.07 million to allow the Hale Empowerment and Revitalization Organization (HERO), Inc., to rehabilitate 37 homes. A HUD-approved non-profit housing organization, HERO will sell the properties to Katrina evacuees under affordable conditions. If the family is unable to purchase the property, HERO can lease the home to the family. In addition, HERO will partner with local housing authorities to invoke a disaster preference in their administrative plan. This will allow local PHAs to provide the families with a public housing or Housing Choice Voucher unit, thereby allowing HERO to free up the property for sale or lease to another low-income family.
The average sales price for the 37 properties announced today is $85,000 with average rehab costs estimated at between $10,000 and $25,000. For more information about this program, visit HUD's website."
11/15/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-254.cfm,HUD Approves $132 Million Mississippi Disaster Plan,"BILOXI, MISSISSIPPI - U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan and Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour today announced the approval of a $132 million disaster recovery plan proposed by the State of Mississippi that will direct federal funding to Hurricane Katrina housing recovery in southern Mississippi. Primarily funded through HUD supplemental disaster recovery Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds, the program supports the long-term recovery in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. The plan includes a new Neighborhood Home program that will repair low-and-moderate-income homes damaged by Hurricane Katrina and assist qualified low-and-moderate-income families to occupy Mississippi Cottages and find rental housing.
The Neighborhood Home program will provide up to $75,000 worth of repairs, rehabilitation, or reconstruction to lower-income homes damaged by Hurricane Katrina. Mississippi Development Authority's Disaster Recovery Division (MDA-DRD) will administer the program, with case management provided by the State's Housing Resource Centers. Other programs will provide assistance to qualified households seeking to permanently occupy cottages and to qualified renters whose apartments were damaged by Hurricane Katrina.
""We are pleased to accept Mississippi's Long-Term Workforce Housing Action Plan Amendment that will provide necessary funding to help those residents displaced by Hurricane Katrina,"" said Secretary Donovan. ""We are fully committed to working with all parties involved to ensure that the affected families receive the relief and long-term recovery assistance that they are due.""
The agreement comes nearly two years after a lawsuit was filed on behalf of the Mississippi Conference NAACP, Gulf Coast Fair Housing Center and numerous individual plaintiffs. The lawsuit claims that Mississippi improperly redirected $570 million in housing funds toward the restoration and expansion of the State Port at Gulfport. With HUD's approval of Mississippi's action plan and outreach plan, attorneys for the plaintiffs and HUD filed for a motion to dismiss the appeal now pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
The State will immediately undertake an outreach campaign for the Neighborhood Home program in Hancock, Harrison, Jackson, Pearl River, Stone, George, Lamar, Forrest, and Jones Counties. Applications are being accepted immediately at designated intake centers identified in the attachment to this press release, and will be accepted through January 31, 2011. For more information on program details, go to www.msdisasterrecovery.com. Residents can also call the United Way 211 Call Center to access information about the intake center closest to them.

11/16/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-252.cfm,FHA Issues Annual Financial Status Report to Congress,"WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) today released its annual report to Congress on the financial status of its Mutual Mortgage Insurance (MMI) Fund, FHA's principal insurance account that includes all single-family and reverse mortgage activity. FHA's study finds that since last year, the capital reserve ratio held steady, insurance claims declined significantly, and the economic value of FHA's single-family insurance program grew by more than $1 billion, from $3.6 billion in 2009 to $4.7 billion in 2010.
Like last year's report to Congress, this accounting shows that FHA is sustaining significant losses from loans insured prior to 2009 and its capital reserve ratio remains below the congressionally mandated threshold of two percent of all insurance-in-force. However, the report concludes that under conservative assumptions of future growth of home prices, and without any new policy actions, FHA's capital ratio is expected to approach two percent in 2014 and exceed the statutory requirement in 2015.
""It's clear that FHA is in a stronger position today than we were just one year ago,"" said FHA Commissioner David H. Stevens. ""While we are not yet completely out of the woods, based on the evidence we're seeing, FHA is weathering the economic storm while helping to create a firm foundation for our nation's recovery.""
FHA's capital reserve ratio measures reserves in excess of those needed to cover projected losses over the next 30 years. The independent actuarial reviews of the MMI Fund estimate FHA's capital reserve ratio to be 0.50 percent of total insurance-in-force this year, falling fractionally from 0.53 percent in 2009. The difference is primarily attributed to the use of much more conservative assumptions regarding future house price growth than were used last year, which also resulted in an $8.5 billion decrease in economic value. However, that decrease was offset by a variety of factors, including an $8.7 billion increase in value due to better credit quality, loan performance, and the premium increase implemented earlier this year.
Due in large part to the performance of recently originated loans, FHA's total capital resources increased by $1.5 billion since last year, to $33.3 billion, and are at their highest level ever - $5.5 billion greater than predicted last year. If the economy were to suffer a further significant downturn, recovery of the capital ratio could be delayed beyond the projected timeframe. However, even in the actuaries' worst-case stress test scenario, FHA's capital resources remain sufficient to cover projected claim losses and FHA would not require a taxpayer subsidy, an improvement over last year's assessment and due to new loans having higher credit quality than had been anticipated.
Loans insured before 2009 are responsible for 70 percent of the expected single family loan losses. Though they are now prohibited, so-called ""seller-financed down payment assistance loans"" produced $6.6 billion in claims to-date and may ultimately cost FHA $13.6 billion. Without these seller-financed loans, FHA's capital ratio would be above the congressionally mandated two percent threshold. Conversely, loans insured since 2009 earned $4.8 billion in economic value to the MMI Fund and are estimated to generate $28.3 billion in economic value by 2016. Expected economic value of FY 2010 and FY 2011 loans alone are estimated to reach $11 billion.
Insurance claim expenses in FY 2010 were 21 percent lower than predicted last year. Even before last year's actuarial study, FHA management began instituting sweeping reforms to strengthen the MMI Fund. These policies have improved loan quality, strengthened lender enforcement, and helped to protect future performance. As a result, the FY 2010 and future books-of-business are expected to generate significant amounts of net capital resources that will help pay losses on earlier books and rebuild the capital position of the MMI Fund.
Since July 2009, FHA implemented the most sweeping reforms to its credit policies, risk management, lender enforcement, and consumer protections in its history. FHA hired its first Chief Risk Officer and established a permanent risk office to expand FHA's capacity to assess financial and operational risk, perform more sophisticated data analysis, and respond to market developments. FHA also increased enforcement of its lenders, changed the approval process making lenders liable for oversight of their mortgage brokers, and strengthened FHA's lender approval requirements.
In addition, FHA eliminated approval for loan correspondents and increased net worth requirements for lenders. FHA introduced a new premium structure that is more in line with private mortgage insurers' pricing, and is estimated to provide approximately $300 million per month of additional capital to the MMI Fund. Furthermore, FHA has changed its credit score and down payment requirements to ensure that FHA provides access to borrowers who have historically performed well. Specifically, a minimum down payment of 10 percent is now required of borrowers with credit scores below 580 and applicants with credit scores below 500 are no longer eligible for FHA insurance.
Over this past year, FHA:
Served more than 1.75 million households by insuring $319 billion in single-family mortgages. This volume was second only to FY 2009. Enabled 882,000 families to become homeowners for the first time. This represents one-third of all first-time buyers in the nation. Helped more than 450,000 families avoid foreclosure through loss mitigation actions. Helped 556,000 families to refinance their mortgage at lower interest rates, saving households an average of more than $140 per month. Provided access to credit for close to 40 percent of purchase mortgages including 60 percent of all African-American and Hispanic homebuyers. Helped more than 450,000 families avoid foreclosure through loss mitigation actions.

11/18/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-255.cfm,Obama Administration Releases November Housing Scorecard,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of the Treasury today released the November edition of the Obama Administration's Housing Scorecard (www.hud.gov/scorecard). The latest housing figures show continued signs of stabilization in house prices and high home affordability due in part to record low mortgage interest rates. The housing scorecard is a comprehensive report on the nation's housing market.
""The Obama Administration has made significant strides in promoting stability for the housing market and the nation's homeowners. Through a range of swift actions since we took office, we've seen millions more families able to stay in their homes and a steady rise in responsible borrowers refinancing their loans or becoming homeowners,"" said HUD Assistant Secretary Raphael Bostic. ""But, while we cannot stop every foreclosure, we know that more has to be done to reach homeowners in distress and to help unemployed borrowers. That's why we're continuing to focus on successfully implementing the programs we've put in place - such as neighborhood stabilization funding, additional assistance on refinancing and emergency loans to help unemployed homeowners - and ensuring that help is available to homeowners as early as possible.""
""The recent reports of problems in the foreclosure process underscore the importance of helping responsible homeowners avoid the pain of foreclosure,"" said acting Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability Timothy Massad. ""As we implement additional program enhancements to reach more homeowners, we continue to stress to mortgage servicers the importance of making every effort to enroll eligible homeowners in HAMP and provide meaningful alternatives to avoidable foreclosures.""
The November Housing Scorecard features key data on the health of the housing market including:
An additional 1 million families refinanced their mortgages in the last quarter, taking advantage of the lowest rates in history on 30-year fixed mortgages. Since April 2009, record low interest rates have helped more than 8.3 million homeowners to refinance, resulting in more stable home prices and $15.2 billion in annual borrower savings. As expected with the expiration of the Homebuyer Tax Credit, new and existing home sales have remained below levels seen in the first half of 2010. At the same time, home prices remained level in the past year after 33 straight months of decline and homeowners added $95 billion in home equity in the second quarter. More than 3.73 million modification arrangements were started between April 2009 and the end of August 2010 —more than double the number of foreclosure completions during that time. These modification arrangements included nearly 1.4 million trial Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) modification starts, more than 600,000 Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loss mitigation and early delinquency interventions, and nearly 1.8 million proprietary modifications under HOPE Now. While some homeowners may have received help from more than one program, the number of agreements offered were more than double the number of foreclosure completions for the same period (1.6 million).

11/19/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-256.cfm,"Vice President Biden Announces New Initiatives to Help Homeowners, Veterans, and Workers Access Legal Services","WASHINGTON, DC - At a Middle Class Task Force event today, co-hosted by the Department of Justice's Access to Justice Initiative, Vice President Biden announced a series of steps designed to help middle class and low-income families secure their legal rights. These actions include strengthening foreclosure mediation programs, helping veterans secure the legal help they need, and making it easier for workers to find a qualified attorney when they believe their rights have been violated.
""In difficult economic times, we want to make sure all Americans—regardless of income or status—have access to the resources they need to pursue justice,"" said Vice President Joe Biden. ""The initiatives we are announcing today represent an important step toward that goal and will help thousands of Americans get the legal assistance they need.""
Today's announcement is the culmination of work between the Department of Justice's (DOJ) Access to Justice Initiative and federal agencies like the Department of Labor (DOL), the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), as well as partners in the advocacy community.
""As a prosecutor and former judge, I know that the fundamental integrity of our justice system, and our faith in it, depends on effective representation on both sides of the courtroom,"" said Attorney General Eric Holder. ""With the strides we have made - and with the additional steps soon to come - I am confident that we can build a fairer and more effective justice system.""
""Many people's lives can be improved without major new investments, and in fact with real savings, if we simply help them access the legal rights and benefits that are theirs. That's why the Department's Access to Justice Initiative is honored to work with the Vice President, HUD, the Labor Department, and the VA to make justice a reality,"" said DOJ Senior Counselor for Access to Justice Larry Tribe.
Legal Support for Workers
The Department of Labor and the American Bar Association (ABA) today announced a collaboration to help workers resolve complaints received by DOL's Wage and Hour Division, such as not getting paid the minimum wage or not being paid overtime, or being denied family medical leave. Beginning on December 13, 2010, complainants whose cases cannot be resolved by DOL because of limited capacity will be given a toll-free number to a newly created system where they are connected to an ABA-approved attorney referral provider if there are participating attorneys in their area.
In addition, if DOL has conducted an investigation, the complainant will be given information about the findings to provide to an attorney who may take the case, including the violations at issue and any back wages owed. DOL has also developed a special process for complainants and representing attorneys to obtain relevant case information and documents when available.
Said Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis, ""Our nation's workers deserve full and fair compensation, and this Administration is committed to ensuring that they receive it. Today's announced collaboration with the American Bar Association streamlines worker access to additional legal resources and builds on the Department of Labor's continued efforts to ensure that employers comply with America's labor laws.""
Veterans' Access to Legal Help
Today the Vice President announced that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Legal Services Corporation (LSC) have launched an awareness campaign between the VA's community-based Vet Centers and local LSC legal aid service providers to help veterans better address legal challenges in areas such as foreclosure, consumer fraud, and employment issues. The first phase of the new awareness campaign is already underway. LSC-funded programs have reached out to 51 Vet Centers operated by the Department of Veterans Affairs in the mid-Atlantic region, Maine, and Arkansas to share information about legal services and to create appropriate referral systems to minimize veterans' frustration in obtaining advice and representation on civil legal problems. In support of this effort, the LSC announced the launch of a new website, www.StatesideLegal.org, to help veterans access information online. The site was developed to explain legal and military terms in a straightforward way, and includes videos and interactive forms to help veterans advocate for themselves. Information on the website covers such topics as disability benefits, employment, and legal protections for service members confronted with foreclosure actions.
Foreclosure Mediation Programs
Foreclosure mediation programs are designed to identify alternatives to foreclosure that benefit both the homeowner and the lender. Today, the Vice President announced a number of initiatives to strengthen these mediation programs.
DOJ's Access to Justice Initiative and HUD issued a joint report identifying emerging strategies for effective foreclosure mediation programs, such as well-trained housing counselors and pro bono attorneys who can counsel and support homeowners throughout the mediation process. To assist jurisdictions that are developing or expanding mediation programs, the report describes several features that have a positive impact on program effectiveness. The report also lists existing foreclosure mediation programs that are interested in sharing their experiences with other program stakeholders throughout the country. To view the report, go HERE (www.justice.gov/atj/effective-mediation-prog-strategies.pdf).
Additionally, HUD announced a new training webinar that will highlight strategies and resources for avoiding foreclosure. The training, which is aimed at a wide variety of audiences including homeowners, housing counselors, pro bono attorneys and mediators, will include topics such as accessing housing counseling resources, finding state-specific foreclosure prevention resources, avoiding foreclosure rescue scams, and understanding Federal foreclosure prevention programs.
HUD also provided guidance on the use of Community Development Block Grant and Neighborhood Stabilization Funds for housing counseling, a resource that can increase the effectiveness of foreclosure mediation programs.
In addition to these efforts, NeighborWorks, a national non-profit created by Congress and funded by Congressional appropriations, will debut a foreclosure mediation workshop at the NeighborWorks Training Institute in December. More than 2,000 counselors and other nonprofit professionals are expected to attend the Training Institute. NeighborWorks is one of the largest funders of foreclosure-mitigation counseling in the nation, and is the administrator of the National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling program.
Finally, the Federal Trade Commission today announced a new rule and several enforcement actions to protect vulnerable homeowners from mortgage rescue fraud.

12/01/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-260.cfm,"HUD Secretary Donovan Announces That Recovery Act Funding Has Prevented or Ended Homelessness for Over 750,000 Persons","WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Shaun Donovan announced today that homelessness for 750,000 Americans was prevented or ended, thanks to HUD's Homelessness Prevention and Rapid Re-housing Program (HPRP), funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The program provided $1.5 billion to local communities to keep families in their homes or help them find other affordable housing after a sudden financial crisis, which might have otherwise led to homelessness.
""Preventing or ending homelessness for over 750,000 Americans is a major milestone for the Recovery Act and for the Obama Administration's Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness,"" said Secretary Donovan. ""Often times, a little bit of financial assistance can make all the difference between finding or keeping a stable home and being forced to live in a shelter or on the streets.""
HUD requires each grantee to participate in its local Homeless Management Information System (HMIS), where client-level data is entered and collected on the households served through HPRP on a quarterly basis. The grantee and/or subgrantee compiles the reported data and provides HUD with an unduplicated count of person and households served in the reporting quarter and date, as well as whether the household exited the program to stable housing. On an annual basis, HUD captures additional detailed data from the grantees that is published in the Annual Homelessness Assessment Report.
The Recovery Act provided $1.5 billion to fund HPRP, which was a new program created specifically under the Recovery Act. These grants offer communities a resource to provide short- and medium-term rental assistance and services to prevent individuals and families from becoming homeless or to quickly re-house those who are experiencing homelessness.
Grants provided under HPRP are not intended to provide long-term support for individuals and families, nor do they provide mortgage assistance to homeowners facing foreclosure. Rather, HPRP offers short- and medium-term financial assistance and services to those who would otherwise become homeless, and those who are already in homeless shelters or living on the street, many due to sudden economic crisis. This can include short-term rental assistance (up to three months), medium-term rental assistance (up to 18 months), security deposits, utility deposits and/or utility payments, moving cost assistance, and hotel vouchers. Payments will not be made directly to households, but only to third parties, such as landlords or utility companies.
The goal of the program is to increase housing stability for those individuals and families served with HPRP assistance. To see the full list of persons served by state, click here.
Secretary Donovan and the Department are committed to providing the highest level of transparency possible as Recovery Act funds are administered. It is vitally important that the American people are fully aware of how their tax dollars are being spent and can hold their federal leaders accountable. Every dollar of Recovery Act funds HUD spends can be reviewed and tracked at HUD's Recovery Act website. The full text of HUD's funding notices and tracking of future performance of these grants is also available at HUD's Recovery Act website."

""All across this country, there are rural and tribal communities with forward-thinking plans on how to address their housing and employment challenges and we need to support this innovation,"" said Donovan. ""These grants will stimulate new approaches to old problems, particularly in areas struggling with poor housing conditions and deep poverty.""
HUD's new Rural Innovation Fund offers grants of up to $2 million to support innovative housing and economic development activities. Eligible applicants include federally recognized Indian tribes, state housing finance agencies (HFAs), state community development agencies, local rural non-profit organizations, community development corporations, or consortia of these groups. Grantees can use their grant funding to support a variety of housing and economic development activities including construction, preparation of plans, land acquisition, demolition, homeownership counseling, and financial assistance.
Applicants may apply for only one of three grant types:
Single Purpose Grants - At least $7.5 million will be awarded to certain applicants that identify a specific area of need, with maximum individual grants of up to $300,000. HUD is encouraging, though not requiring, applicants to address both housing and economic development needs within the defined 'project area.'
Comprehensive Grants - HUD will award up to $2 million to certain applicants that comprehensively examine the social, housing and economic needs of a target area and address those needs through activities that leverage other sources of public and private financing. Eligible activities under this category of grant are broader than those outlined in the Single Purpose Grant category. Highly ranked applicants can also be expected to work closely and leverage resources with regional entities in order to promote economic competitiveness beyond the local level.
Economic Development and Entrepreneurship for Federally Recognized Tribes - At least $5 million will be awarded to support economic development and entrepreneurship opportunities for federally recognized tribes, with maximum individual grants up to $800,000.
HUD anticipates posting its funding notice on Grants.gov by December 10th. The posting on grants.gov will begin the solicitation of grant applications. To read the full text of the funding notice for the new Rural Innovation Fund, visit HUD's website."
12/03/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-261.cfm,Researchers Call for New Approaches to Brownfield Redevelopment,"WASHINGTON - All across the country, there are environmentally challenged areas called 'brownfields,' contaminated properties that often require substantial cleanup before they can be reused for another purposes. In the latest issue of Cityscape, an independent journal published by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, several scholars are calling for new policies and approaches that could significantly accelerate stalled brownfield redevelopment.
Cityscape is a scholarly journal published by HUD's Office of Policy Development and Research. The opinions expressed in individual articles do not necessarily reflect the views of the Department.
The November issue of Cityscape includes five articles that report new findings on the redevelopment of contaminated inner-city brownfields. After decades of policy discussions and debate about the effects of the nation's Superfund law on the inner city, the authors find that brownfields redevelopers confront much larger obstacles than just site decontamination.
Peter Meyer of the private research firm E.P. Systems Group, explores the seemingly irreconcilable conflicts between economic development and environmental improvement. This paper offers a review of some American responses that avoid sacrificing the environment for economic gains and suggests lessons that states and municipalities may learn from each other. One of his major conclusions is that, since current partial brownfields clean-up approaches are not reliable over the long run and will inevitably fail, residents and other neighborhood stakeholders need to be more involved from the start.
Anna Alberini and Dennis Guignet of the University of Maryland examine whether a state Voluntary Cleanup Program (VCP) can support redevelopment of contaminated properties in an urban industrial area; they find that participation in the program may over time substantially enhance the use of inner-city property for industrial and commercial uses.
Marie Howland of the University of Maryland focuses on the impact of site contamination on sales of properties in an industrial area of Baltimore. A researcher at the University of Maryland, she finds that, after the mid-1990s, contaminated parcels sold on the private market fetched prices significantly lower due to contamination and associated cleanup costs. She concludes that, while the private market can address the costs of site cleanup itself, public intervention, through subsidy or even eminent domain, is still needed to overcome the classic problems of obsolete and fragmented land use and urban infrastructure.
Eugene Goldfarb of the University of Illinois-Chicago looks at HUD's own brownfields policy. He finds that brownfields mitigation efforts could be implemented well but that more guidance and oversight is needed to make the process sustainable over time.
Finally, David Slutzky (University of Virginia) and A.J. Frey (Washington and Lee University) examine the uncertain liabilities of lenders and developers who attempt to redevelop or reuse brownfields even though they did not cause the contamination. The authors offer a two-part proposal: eliminate the liability of ""truly innocent third parties"" and replenish the Superfund by providing incentives for developers to make voluntary contributions to it.

12/03/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-262.cfm,U.S. Announces Settlements with Two Cincinnati Landlords - 294 Housing Units to Become Lead Safe,"CINCINNATI - The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Ohio, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) today announced two settlements against landlords for failing to inform tenants that their homes may contain potentially dangerous lead. The agreements require the landlords to replace windows and cleanup lead-based paint hazards in 31 residential properties containing a total of 294 units (see attached list). In addition to the $480,000 worth of lead abatement work being performed, the landlords also agree to pay civil penalties totalling $12,500.
According to the Federal Government, Combined Development Company I, LLC; Combined Development Company II, LLC; Combined Development Company III, LLC; Fairbanks-Sunset, LLC; 319 Howell Ave., LLC; 3026 Robertson Ave., LLC; Reading-Observatory, LLC; and Linwood-Collins, LLC (collectively ""Combined Development""); and Kogan Realty Enterprises, LLC (""Kogan Realty"") violated the Federal Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act (Residential Lead Act) by failing to inform tenants that their homes may contain potentially dangerous levels of lead.
Cincinnati health department officials identified one address each for Combined Development and Kogan Realty where a child was lead poisoned while they lived in a home owned or managed by the landlords. Going forward, both companies will ensure that information about lead-based paint will be provided to their tenants before they are obligated under their lease.
Combined Development
As a result of the settlement entered today, Combined Development tested all nine of its residential properties containing a total of 166 units for lead-based paint. Combined Development will perform lead-based paint hazard reduction work, including window replacement and abatement of all friction and impact surfaces, within a period of five years at an estimated cost of $280,000 to make those units lead safe for families. In addition, Combined Development will pay a $7,500 civil money penalty.
Kogan Realty
The Kogan Realty settlement was previously entered on June 14, 2010. Under that settlement, Kogan Realty tested its 22 properties for lead-based paint and started performing lead-based paint hazard reduction work, including window replacement and abatement of all friction and impact surfaces, in the 128 residential units it owns and manages and will complete the work within a period of five years at an estimated cost of $200,000. In addition to rendering units lead safe for its tenants, Kogan Realty also paid a $5,000 civil money penalty.
""We hope this settlement serves as a reminder to landlords and property management companies to do the right thing - follow the Rule and protect our children,"" said HUD Deputy Secretary Ron Sims. ""Fourteen years after the Lead Disclosure Rule was put into place, children are still at risk of lead's destructive and permanent effects. HUD is absolutely committed to enforcing the Lead Disclosure Rule to prevent harm.""
""Through these enforcement actions, EPA is sending a clear message to landlords and home sellers that protecting children's health from lead-based paint exposure is one of our highest priorities,"" said Region 5 Administrator Susan Hedman.
""The settlements announced today represent the first two joint Lead Disclosure Rule enforcement actions in Cincinnati, Ohio,"" U.S. Attorney Carter M. Stewart said. ""These actions to protect families' rights to a safe living environment are the result of successful coordination among local health officials and federal investigators.""
HUD, EPA and the Department of Justice are continuing similar enforcement efforts around the nation, and so far have taken enforcement actions in which landlords have agreed to conduct lead-based paint hazard reduction in more than 186,253 apartments and pay $1,317,399 in civil penalties. In addition, a total of $703,750 has been provided by Defendants to community-based projects to reduce lead poisoning. In settling these cases, landlords have committed to expend more than an estimated $31 million to address lead-based paint hazards in the affected units.
Background
The Residential Lead Act is one of the primary federal enforcement tools to prevent lead poisoning in young children. The Lead Disclosure Rule requires home sellers and landlords of housing built before 1978 to disclose to purchasers and tenants knowledge of lead-based paint or lead-based paint hazards using a disclosure form, signed by both parties, attached to the sales contract or lease containing the required lead warning statement, provide any available records or reports, and provide an EPA-approved ""Protect Your Family From Lead in Your Home"" pamphlet. Sellers must also provide purchasers with an opportunity to conduct a lead-based paint inspection and/or risk assessment at the purchaser's expense. Acceptable lead disclosure forms can be found at www.hud.gov/offices/lead/enforcement/disclosure.cfm and www.epa.gov/lead/pubs/leadbase.htm.
Health Effects of Lead-Based Paint
Lead exposure causes reduced IQ, learning disabilities, developmental delays, reduced height, poorer hearing, and a host of other health problems in young children. Many of these effects are thought to be irreversible. In later years, lead-poisoned children are much more likely to drop out of school, become juvenile delinquents and engage in criminal and other anti-social behavior. As reported in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers found that even at low levels, lead exposure in children can significantly impact IQ and even delay puberty in young girls.
At higher levels, lead can damage a child's kidneys and central nervous system and cause anemia, coma, convulsions and even death. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 310,000 of the nation's 20 million children under the age of six have blood lead levels high enough to impair their ability to think, concentrate and learn.
Eliminating lead-based paint hazards in older low-income housing is essential if childhood lead poisoning is to be eradicated. According to CDC estimates, the percentage of children with elevated blood lead levels has been cut in half since the early 1990's, although as many as 1 million children are still affected by lead poisoning today. HUD estimates that the number of houses with lead paint has declined from 64 million in 1990 to 38 million in 2000. About 24 million homes still have significant lead-based paint hazards.

12/06/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-263.cfm,HUD and San Francisco Housing Authority Agreement Increases Housing Opportunities for Native Americans,"WASHINGTON - The San Francisco Housing Authority (SFHA) will reinstate a Native American family's rental assistance under a voluntary agreement with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) that settles allegations that SFHA employees said they did not work with Indian tribes and refused to accept the family's tribal documents.
The agreement comes after Myron Standing Bear, a father of two who has disabilities, filed a complaint with HUD claiming that SFHA discriminated against him because of his race, disability, and family status when it initially denied him rental assistance. The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in housing transactions based on race, color, national origin, sex, religion, family status, and disability.
""This settlement ensures equal acceptance of Native American tribal documents,"" said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity.
According to accounts reported in POOR Magazine, SFHA employees told Standing Bear that they didn't ""work with Indians, Indian tribes, and the Indian Child Welfare Act"" and refused to accept his tribal guardianship documents. SFHA denied making the statements.
""Articles like the POOR Magazine story that was printed in the San Francisco Bay View assist our efforts to end housing discrimination,"" stated Trasviña. ""When we hear about stories like this from the media or the community we take action.""
Under the terms of the agreement, in addition to reinstating Standing Bear's rental assistance through HUD's Housing Choice Voucher Program, SFHA will issue guidance regarding acceptable documentation from Native American sources.
FHEO and its partners in the Fair Housing Assistance Program investigate more than 10,000 housing discrimination complaints annually. People who believe they are the victims of housing discrimination should contact HUD at 1-800-669-9777 (voice), 800-927-9275 (TTY)."
12/07/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-264.cfm,"HUD Approves $31 Million Financing Plan to Fund Major Addition to Critical Access Hospital in Springfield, Georgia","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced a commitment to insure a mortgage loan to the Effingham County Hospital Authority in Springfield, Georgia. The $31 million loan is made possible through the Federal Housing Administration's (FHA) Section 242 Hospital Mortgage Insurance Program.
The existing hospital facility has space limitations and infrastructure problems. Portions of the facility such as the emergency room, surgery suites, and imaging areas, are unable to accommodate today's technology. The FHA-insured loan will be used to finance an addition to the facility that will include a new emergency room, inpatient and outpatient surgery areas, laboratory, and imaging departments. The project will also include renovation of existing space for a dedicated Alzheimer's unit.
""FHA financing is helping to expand access to medical care in this part of Georgia,"" said FHA Commissioner David Stevens. ""By helping to make these projects possible, FHA also contributes to the financial well-being of communities by creating jobs to stimulate local economies.""
HUD estimates the Effingham County Hospital Authority construction project will support 342 full-time jobs and provide an estimated economic stimulus of more than $80.8 million to the community. Once completed, it is estimated the project will support 142 full-time jobs and provide an annual economic benefit of $22.7 million. HUD's estimates are based on results from an economic model used by public and private institutions to examine a variety of economic development issues.
By insuring the mortgage loan, FHA is enabling the hospital to obtain lower cost financing that will save an estimated $6.2 million in interest expense over the life of the loan. Since 1968, FHA has insured 394 mortgages to hospitals throughout the nation.
FHA's Section 242 Mortgage Insurance Program for Hospitals provides HUD-insured mortgages made by private lending institutions to finance construction or renovation of acute care hospitals including major equipment needed to operate the facility. Eligible applicants can be public, proprietary, or nonprofit hospitals certified by the responsible State agency."

The $22 million loan is made possible through the Federal Housing Administration's (FHA) Section 242 Hospital Mortgage Insurance Program.
The existing hospital was constructed in 1969 and was designed primarily for inpatient care. Though there have been various building additions and improvements in subsequent years, it is no longer suitable for the hospital's growing outpatient volume. The FHA-insured mortgage loan will be used to construct a new three-story, 18-bed, critical access hospital adjacent to the existing facility. The loan will also be used to refinance a 2005 loan related to expansion of the Coquille Medical Clinic.
""FHA financing is helping to expand access to medical care in this part of Oregon,"" said FHA Commissioner David Stevens. ""By helping to make these projects possible, FHA also contributes to the financial well-being of communities by creating jobs to stimulate local economies.""
HUD estimates the Coquille Valley Hospital construction project will support 383 full-time jobs and provide an estimated economic stimulus of more than $55.2 million to the community.

12/08/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-266.cfm,HUD to Investigate Allegations That 22 Banks and Mortgage Lenders Discriminate Against African American and Latino Loan Seekers,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced today that it is launching multiple investigations into the practices of certain mortgage lenders to determine if their home loan policies illegally deny qualified African American and Latino borrowers access to credit.
The investigations are in response to 22 complaints the National Community Reinvestment Coalition (NCRC) filed with HUD alleging that the loan activities of the mortgage originators showed that their home lending practices deny FHA- insured loans to African Americans and Latinos with credit scores as high as 640. Federal Housing Administration (FHA) guidelines allow mortgages to borrowers with credit scores above 580, provided the borrowers have down payments equaling 3.5 percent of the loan amount, or above 500, provided the borrowers have down payments equaling 10 percent of the loan amount.
""FHA is an important vehicle for Americans who want to purchase or refinance a home. We thank NCRC for bringing these complaints to HUD. For lenders to deny responsible home seekers this source of credit, without regard for their capacity to repay the loans, would raise serious fair housing concerns and, if proven, undermine our nation's recovery efforts,"" said HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity John Trasviña. ""HUD will take appropriate action against any lender found to be engaging in discriminatory practices.""
Prior to the recent downturn in the economy, FHA-insured mortgages comprised less than three percent of new home loans. Since the economic crisis, FHA and the Government-Sponsored Enterprises have insured or guaranteed nearly 95 percent of new mortgage loans being originated. By the end of 2008, almost half of new home purchase loans and one quarter of new refinance loans were FHA or Veterans Administration (VA) insured.
According to NCRC, an association of more than 600 community-based organizations that promote access to basic banking services, their fair lending ""testers"" evaluated the practices of national lenders, financial services corporations, and other regional and local FHA-approved lenders. In the complaints filed on December 7, NCRC states that lenders were chosen according to their market share and volume of FHA loans, as well as through discussions with community leaders.
Under the Fair Housing Act, HUD impartially investigates allegations of housing discrimination and, during every phase of investigations, attempts to settle complaints through conciliation efforts.
FHA was created in 1934 and currently insures more than 6.5 million single family loans. 80 percent of loans insured by FHA in 2010 were to first-time homebuyers and more than 30 percent of home purchase loans were to minority homebuyers.

12/13/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-267.cfm,FHA Takes Action Against Cambridge Home Capital,"WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration's Mortgagee Review Board (MRB) today announced that it is permanently withdrawing FHA approval of Cambridge Home Capital, LLC (CHC), a Great Neck, New York-based lender. In addition, the MRB will seek a monetary penalty of $182,000.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, along with HUD's Office of Inspector General, worked closely with the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Southern District of New York in related civil fraud charges announced today against CHC.
The MRB took these actions based upon Cambridge Home Capital's (CHC) numerous and egregious violations of FHA requirements, including: failure to maintain and implement a required Quality Control Plan; failure to document the stability and/or source of borrowers' income, approving loans with grossly excessive debt-to-income ratios without compensating factors to justify approval; and using conflicting information in originating and obtaining FHA mortgage insurance.
""The serious and egregious violations we discovered require strong action in order to protect the best interests of FHA and the public,"" said FHA Commissioner David H. Stevens. ""FHA's underwriting standards are there for a reason - to ensure sustainable homeownership for borrowers and to protect the financial health of the insurance fund so we can continue to meet our public mission.""
During the course of FHA's investigation, the Department found:
CHC failed to implement and maintain a Quality Control (QC) Plan for the origination and/or servicing of FHA-insured mortgages. An acceptable QC Plan requires the mortgagee's office to be sufficiently staffed with trained personnel. In addition, the mortgagee is prohibited from setting a minimum loan amount. CHC failed to adequately document the stability and/or source of income used to qualify borrowers. The purpose of underwriting is to determine the borrower's ability and willingness to repay the mortgage debt. To do this, the mortgagee must examine and verify income and employment. In nine sampled loans, CHC failed to do this. Investigators found examples where borrowers' income was significantly overstated and sources of income were not verified. CHC approved loans with ratios that exceeded FHA guidelines without the required ""significant compensating factors."" Mortgage and overall debt-to-income ratios are used to determine whether a borrower can reasonably be expected to meet mortgage expenses. Whenever these ratios exceed FHA standards, the mortgagee is required to specify its rationale for approving the mortgage. In 13 sampled loans, CHC approved the mortgages without adequate significant compensating factors and/or documentation. CHC used conflicting information in originating and obtaining FHA mortgage insurance. A mortgagee is required to verify and document all information that supports its decision to approve a loan. In four sample loans, the company used documentation that contained discrepancies involving borrowers' employment, credit scores, and property addresses.

The latest housing figures show continued home affordability in the housing market, with interest rates near record lows, but the market remains fragile, as prices are unsettled. Foreclosure starts and completions dropped significantly in November, as lenders review internal servicing procedures. The housing scorecard is a comprehensive report on the nation's housing market.
""The Obama Administration's broad set of programs have helped promote stability for the housing market, neighborhoods, and the nation's homeowners, but there is much more work to be done,"" said HUD Assistant Secretary Raphael Bostic. ""Since taking office in 2009, the Administration's efforts have helped millions families stay in their homes and helped millions more refinance, but the data clearly show that the market remains extremely fragile. That's why we're continuing to focus on successfully implementing the programs we've put in place - such as additional refinancing assistance and emergency loans to help unemployed homeowners - and ensuring that help is available to homeowners as early as possible.""
""While much work remains to be done to help families that have been hurt by this crisis, the Administration's programs have benefitted many homeowners directly while setting standards for the entire industry,"" said acting Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability Tim Massad. ""This is a major reason why there have been more than twice as many modifications and other foreclosure alternatives as foreclosure completions since April 2009.""
The December Housing Scorecard features key data on the health of the housing market including:
Foreclosure starts and completions dropped significantly in November. As lenders review internal procedures related to foreclosure processing, many foreclosure actions have been delayed leading to a 21 percent drop in foreclosure activity in November. While this is the biggest month over month decrease since 2005, the decline is likely to be temporary as lenders eventually revise and resubmit foreclosure paperwork in the coming months. As expected with the expiration of the Homebuyer Tax Credit, new and existing home sales have remained below levels seen in the first half of 2010. However, this month's report also shows that home prices and home equity declined moderately, as prices remain unsettled at this fragile stage of the recovery. More than 3.9 million mortgage aid offers were initiated between April 2009 and the end of October 2010 - more than double the number of foreclosure completions during that time. These actions included over 1.4 million Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) trial modification starts, more than 600,000 Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loss mitigation and early delinquency interventions, and nearly 1.8 million proprietary modifications under HOPE Now. While some homeowners may have received help from more than one program, the number of agreements offered were more than double the number of foreclosure completions for the same period (1.7 million).

""Through the Recovery Act, this funding has made significant progress in providing safer and healthier homes for children in our nation's communities,"" said Donovan. ""At HUD we're not only dedicated to removing these health and safety risks from homes, but also investing in research to study how new technologies can help benefit indoor environmental health for all families.""
HUD allocated more than $80 million in lead hazard reduction grants to states, Indian tribes and local governments to fund comprehensive programs that identify and control lead-based paint hazards in privately owned homes or rental houses. In addition, $2.6 million of the lead hazard reduction grant funding targets communities with the highest lead risks and provides abatement, inspections, risk assessments, temporary relocations and interim control of lead-based paint hazards for low income families living in eligible privately-owned, as well as single family and multifamily housing units.
The Recovery Act's healthy homes grants also provided over $19 million to develop, demonstrate and promote cost effective and preventive measures to correct multiple safety and health hazards in homes that produce serious diseases and injuries, such as asthma, in children. These grants were provided to state and local governments, housing authorities, and colleges and universities to remediate homes, including low-income households, of health hazards.
Secretary Donovan and the Department are committed to providing the highest level of transparency possible as Recovery Act funds are administered. It is vitally important that the American people are fully aware of how their tax dollars are being spent and can hold their federal leaders accountable. Every dollar of Recovery Act funds HUD spends can be reviewed and tracked at HUD's Recovery Act website. The full text of HUD's funding notices and tracking of future performance of these grants is also available at HUD's Recovery Act website."
12/23/2010:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2010/pr10-269.cfm,Obama Administration Announces Nearly $73 Million in Counseling Grants to Help Families Find and Keep Housing,"WASHINGTON - In an effort to help families find decent housing and to prevent future foreclosures, the Obama Administration today announced nearly $73 million in housing counseling grants to more than 500 national, regional and local organizations. As a result of the funding announced today, hundreds of thousands of households will have a greater opportunity to find housing or keep the homes they have because of the housing counseling and counseling training grants awarded today by U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan.
The grants announced today represent a $13 million, or 22 percent increase over last year's funding level. In announcing the grant awards, Donovan said HUD-approved housing counseling agencies are a critical part of the nation's housing recovery.
""These organizations are on the front lines of helping families who are desperate to remain in their homes,"" said Donovan. ""Now, more than ever, it's crucial that we support these agencies that are working with struggling families on a one-to-one basis to manage their money, navigate the homebuying process, and secure their financial futures.""
Housing counseling grants will assist families in becoming first-time homeowners and remaining homeowners after their purchase. HUD-approved counseling agencies not only provide homeownership counseling, but also offer financial literacy training to renters and homeless individuals and families.
Donovan added, ""This critical funding will help counseling organizations continue to assist families in making more informed choices before they purchase a home and counsel families facing foreclosure.""
Nearly $68 million will support the direct provision of housing counseling services by 24 national and regional organizations, 5 multi-state organizations, and 484 state and local housing counseling agencies. In addition, HUD is awarding more than $5 million to three national organizations to train approximately 4,500 counselors who will receive the instruction and certification necessary to effectively assist families with their housing needs.
National and regional agencies distribute much of HUD's housing counseling grant funding to community-based grassroots organizations that provide advice and guidance to low- and moderate-income families seeking to improve their housing conditions. In addition, these larger organizations help improve the quality of housing counseling services and enhance coordination among other counseling providers.
Counseling agencies will use $9.5 million to help assist senior citizens seeking reverse mortgages or Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECM). These agencies will provide counseling for the rapidly growing number of elderly homeowners who seek to convert equity in their homes into income that can be used to pay for home improvements, medical costs, and other living expenses.
The organizations that provide housing counseling services help people become or remain homeowners or find rental housing, and assist homeless persons in finding the transitional housing they need to move toward a permanent place to live. Grant recipients also help homebuyers and homeowners realistically evaluate their readiness for a home purchase, understand their financing and downpayment options, and navigate what can be an extremely confusing and difficult process.
In addition, grantees help combat predatory lending by helping unwary borrowers review their loan documentation, and avoid potential mortgage scams, unreasonably high interest rates, inflated appraisals, unaffordable repayment terms, and other conditions that can result in a loss of equity, increased debt, default, and even foreclosure. Likewise, foreclosure prevention counseling helps homeowners facing delinquency or default employ strategies, including expense reduction, negotiation with lenders and loan servicers, and loss mitigation, to avoid foreclosure. With foreclosures at critical levels nationwide, these services are more important than ever.
HUD awards annual grants under the housing counseling program through a competitive process. Organizations that apply for grants must be HUD-approved and are subject to performance reviews to maintain their HUD-approved status.
