01/05/2017:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2017/pr17-002.cfm,"U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Department of Education and Nonprofit Partners Launch Book-Rich Environments Initiative to Boost Educational Opportunity for Children in Public Housing","WASHINGTON - In an effort to promote literacy and boost educational outcomes for kids in public housing across the country, the U.S. Departments of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and Education (ED) are joining forces with the Campaign for Grade-Level Reading (GLR), the National Book Foundation (NBF) and the Urban Libraries Council (ULC) to launch the Book-Rich Environment (BRE) Initiative.
BRE aims to transform Public Housing Agencies (PHA) into book-rich environments by putting diverse, high quality books and other literacy tools into the hands of children and families living in HUD-assisted housing. BRE was inspired by recommendations by the President's My Brother's Keeper (MBK) Task Force, an initiative to address persistent opportunity gaps faced by America's youth, and ensure that all young people can reach their full potential.
""This initiative will help ensure that young people, no matter where they live, have the tools they need to reach their full potential,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""HUD is proud to join forces with these public and private partners to boost literacy and educational opportunity for our nation's children.""
""President Obama's My Brother's Keeper initiative seeks to build bridges of opportunity and break down barriers for boys and young men of color and for all students so they can reach their full potential,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education John B. King Jr. ""The critical work to ensure an equal opportunity for every child requires true collaboration. We are pleased to join with partners across sectors to announce this innovative partnership with libraries, public housing authorities, and community organizations to give more children access to great books, literacy tools and a love of reading. If education is a ladder, then reading is a first step that can help our children reach places that would otherwise be an impossible climb.""
Nearly 4 million low-income children are living in HUD-assisted housing across the country. BRE aims to foster a love of reading and to improve educational outcomes of children living in HUD-assisted housing by distributing free, high quality books to children, promoting literacy activities offered by local libraries and nonprofits, and by strengthening partnerships between PHAs, local public libraries and literacy partners to develop and deliver programming to improve educational outcomes of PHA residents.
""We applaud HUD and ED for launching this collaborative effort to ensure that public housing communities also are book-rich environments. This is a welcome affirmation of commitment to promoting early learning, early literacy and early school success,"" said Ralph Smith, managing director of the Campaign for Grade-Level Reading. ""The GLR Campaign and its networks of partners will continue to support this Book Rich Environments as it rolls out in communities across the nation.""
""The National Book Foundation's mission includes enhancing the cultural value of great writing in American and is committed to making sure all people, especially young people who are building their identity as readers, have access to great books,"" says National Book Foundation Executive Director Lisa Lucas. ""By collaborating with these key national partners, we are able to build the Foundation's reach and further our mission of making sure that books matter, and that they matter everywhere.""
""This unique partnership is in recognition of our nation's greatest treasure -- our children,"" said ULC CEO Susan Benton. ""We are committed to working together to ensure that our kids and their families have books in their home, books and technology at their neighborhood library and all the support needed to become strong readers who will grow and thrive as adults. And that is exactly what we want for our kids and what this partnership aims to achieve.""
The BRE initiative will launch in 35 communities across the country beginning next month. Public housing authorities will partner with local libraries, organized by the Urban Libraries Council, to host community book distribution events throughout 2017. At these events, public housing residents will have access to a diverse set of high quality books secured by the National Book Foundation (NBF). NBF worked with publishers such as Penguin Random House, the world's largest trade book publisher, which is providing 200,000 books towards the initiative, in furtherance of its mission to nourish a universal passion for reading. Hachette Book Group and Macmillan Publishers have also committed to substantial donations to the initiative. The distribution events will also serve as a platform to strengthen and launch new local partnerships with libraries, public housing authorities and nonprofits, organized by the Campaign for Grade Level Reading, that can help ensure continued access to high quality literacy resources.
The initiative was announced Thursday at a press conference in Washington, D.C.'s Southwest Public Library alongside officials from the D.C. Public Library and the D.C. Public Housing Authority. ""The District of Columbia Housing Authority is excited to be part of the Book-Rich Environment Initiative,"" said DCHA Executive Director Adrianne Todman. ""We know how important it is for children to have access to books and the importance of nurturing lifelong readers. We are thankful for our collaboration with D.C. Public Library, and for the leadership of our federal partners.""
Today's announcement builds on the foundation established by previous critical efforts between HUD and ED to build bridges between school and home, and improve educational and life outcomes for kids and families in HUD assisted housing, including joint efforts to address and eliminate chronic absenteeism, find ways to support college students with unmet financial needs, and create more summer opportunities for young people."

The most comprehensive survey of its kind, the AHS covers a variety of ""core"" housing topics, including the composition and quality of the nation's housing inventory, mortgages and other housing costs, and neighborhood conditions. For the first time in its 42-year history, the American Housing Survey included questions on food security status, which allowed HUD to assign households a ""food security status"" score. Using these categories, households were classified as having ""low"" or ""very low"" food security, which is commonly known as being ""food insecure"".
The 2015 survey includes the following findings:
Housing Costs
Households living in the metros areas of Los Angeles and Miami report spending 30 percent of their monthly income on housing costs while families living in Houston, Atlanta, Detroit, and Seattle spend 21 percent. Families living in the metro area of Portland, Oregon spend 23 percent while Pittsburg residents spend 18 percent of their monthly income on housing costs.
• Households living in the metros areas of Los Angeles and Miami report spending 30 percent of their monthly income on housing costs while families living in Houston, Atlanta, Detroit, and Seattle spend 21 percent.
• Families living in the metro area of Portland, Oregon spend 23 percent while Pittsburg residents spend 18 percent of their monthly income on housing costs.
Health and Hunger:
In 2015, approximately 901,000 households (12.4 percent) in the New York City metro area were experiencing food insecurity while over 100,000 families (5.4 percent) living in the Boston area were experiencing the least in the largest metro areas. 15.9 percent of households in Detroit reported the most exposure to first-hand tobacco inside their home in the largest metro areas while San Francisco reported the least at 4.6 percent.

01/06/2017:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2017/pr17-004.cfm,HUD Charges Bank of America with Discriminatory Lending Practices in South Carolina,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has charged Bank of America, N.A., and two of its employees with violating the Fair Housing Act by discriminating against prospective Hispanic mortgage borrowers in Charleston, South Carolina. Read HUD's charge.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to deny or discriminate in the terms and conditions of a mortgage or loan modification based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, or disability.
""Today's charge reflects our nation's promise of fair housing and equal access to credit for qualified families, regardless of their national origin,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue working to ensure that lenders fulfill their obligation under the law to treat all applicants equally.""
The National Fair Housing Alliance (NFHA) filed a complaint with HUD claiming the bank discriminated against prospective borrowers who are Hispanic by failing to provide them with information about loan products or by offering them loan products with less attractive terms, as compared to prospective borrowers who are not Hispanic. Prior to filing its complaint, NFHA conducted a series of tests comparing the treatment of Hispanic and non-Hispanic testers who posed as prospective borrowers at a Bank of America branch in Charleston, South Carolina. HUD's charge alleges that these tests showed that the bank discriminated because of national origin by treating the Hispanic testers less favorably than the non-Hispanic testers.
The case will be heard in federal district court. If it is determined that illegal discrimination has occurred, a judge may award actual and punitive damages, order injunctive or other equitable relief to deter further discrimination, and order that defendants pay NFHA's attorney fees.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed at www.hud.gov/fairhousing or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple and Android devices."

01/12/2017:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2017/pr17-005.cfm,HUD and VA Secretaries Join DC Mayor and Advocates to Open New Housing for Homeless Veterans,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Julián Castro, U.S. Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA) Robert A. McDonald and District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser joined advocates and housing professionals today to open the John and Jill Ker Conway Residence, an architecturally striking apartment building with 60 units of permanent supportive housing for veterans exiting homelessness and 64 affordable and low-income units. The 124-unit mixed income building is among the first of its kind in the country to have full-time, onsite VA case managers. The soaring structure represents an unusual effort to bring outstanding architecture and design to housing for low-income and homeless populations.
Located at 1005 North Capitol Street, NE, 10 blocks from the Capitol building, the project will diversify and contribute to the ongoing revitalization of the booming NoMa neighborhood, while preserving affordability for residents. It is a collaboration between Community Solutions, a national non-profit organization, and McCormack Baron Salazar, Inc., a leading property development firm.
""It was like somebody took a ton of weight off my back,"" said resident Clifford Rowe, who served in the 101st Airborne Division at the Bay of Pigs and later experienced homelessness for twelve years. ""To find out I had a home coming, that was wonderful."" In the 1970s, at the height of his career, he played bass in Elvis Presley's backup band. But in the '80s, ""the bottom fell out,"" he says. Rowe was evicted, turned to drugs, lost most of his possessions, including gifts from Elvis, and lived in his car. Now he has come full circle, living less than a mile from the house where he grew up and learned to play music. His apartment includes all new furniture and a few of his longtime belongings including the Les Paul guitar he used to back up The King of Rock 'n' Roll.
Commitment to End Homelessness
In November, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development released the 2016 Homeless Point-in-Time Count, revealing that 350 veterans experienced homelessness in Washington, D.C. on a given night in January of last year. Under the leadership of Mayor Bowser and others, the District has driven that number down by more than a third since 2010 - including by more than 14 percent since the North Capitol Street building broke ground in 2014.
The Conway Residence represents a new, more strategic approach to aligning affordable housing development with the District's broader efforts to end veteran homelessness. Veteran tenants were assessed using a research-backed survey, and apartments were offered only to those recommended for permanent supportive housing using that tool, in conjunction with the clinical judgment of VA staff. This reflects a new approach to aligning housing development with a data-driven system for identifying, prioritizing and housing the most vulnerable veterans.
""The John and Jill Ker Conway Residence is the perfect example of the great things that can happen when the public and private sectors unite towards one goal; we are certainly grateful to our federal and private partners who helped make this event a reality,"" said Mayor Muriel Bowser. ""I'm proud to announce to you today that since beginning the push to end Veteran homelessness in the District four years ago—nearly 1,800 Veterans have been housed, with 764 Veterans housed in 2015 and 463 placed into permanent housing in 2016.""
The building also reflects the sustained commitment of the Obama administration to ending veteran homelessness, which has plummeted by nearly half since 2010 - its lowest levels on record.
""This project highlights HUD's commitment to collaborate with local partners to ensure that every man and woman who has served our country has a safe and stable place to call home,"" said Secretary Castro. ""With partnerships like this one, we know the goal of ending veteran homelessness is achievable.""
""Thanks to great partnerships from the White House to the Interagency Council on Homelessness, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), other federal partners, Congress, states, cities, and public and private organizations, we're making significant progress reducing homelessness among Veterans. To end homelessness among Veterans, in cities across the country we will need more housing like the John and Jill Ker Conway Residence,"" said Secretary McDonald. ""That's housing designed with the Veteran in mind that provides an environment sensitive to the needs of Veterans exiting homelessness and regaining control of their lives.""
""We set out to build something beautiful and iconic because those attributes do so much to inspire new tenants as they begin to rebuild their lives in housing,"" said Rosanne Haggerty, president of Community Solutions. ""A building that adds value to the neighborhood and livens up the block is also an immediate asset to a community, and that helps local residents remember that the people living in that building are assets as well - that they are neighbors.""
The building's 60 veterans benefit from the proven ""housing first"" model which provides people experiencing homelessness with permanent housing as quickly as possible - and then provides voluntary supportive services as needed. In the new building, professional VA case managers work onsite to help residents address health, employment and mental health needs, in collaboration with the DC VA Medical Center. All tenants have leases and pay affordable rents based on their income.
""The District of Columbia Housing Authority is proud to continue its efforts to make sure veterans can call Washington, D.C. home. We are providing $13.4 million in Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing subsidy in this state-of-the-art building. In fact, using our award-winning rapid housing model, we were able to quickly inspect and approve these new units in time so veterans could be home for the holidays,"" said DCHA Executive Director Adrianne Todman. ""DCHA is also contributing $3.8 million so that an additional 17 individuals can call this building home.""
Striking, Dignified Design
The eye-catching building was designed by Sorg Architects, recognized internationally for its commitment to sustainability and public interest design. The 14-story building has 124 efficiency apartments including 60 for formerly homeless veterans, 47 for individual households making no more than 60 percent of the Area Median Income, and 17 for tenants making no more than 30 percent of the Area Median Income.
The building's silvery white metal paneling and distinctive ""stacked blocks"" shape create complementary contrast with surrounding buildings, including the historic red brick of St. Phillips Baptist Church next door. Other key design elements include sustainable building materials and an extensive glazing system to enliven the apartment interiors.
""Our primary design goal was not just to provide housing, but to provide it in a way that preserves the dignity, individuality, privacy and stability of all the residents,"" said architect Suman Sorg. ""By innovatively using forms, materials, and systems we were able to produce a building that meets and, I would venture, exceeds the design of many high end residential buildings in our city.""
The building is named for Jill Ker Conway and her late husband, John, a veteran of World War II. Jill Conway is a Pulitzer Prize-nominated memoirist, Harvard-trained historian and former chair of the Community Solutions Board of Directors. She was the first female president of Smith College, a post she held for 10 years. Her lifelong concern for veterans was influenced by the experiences of her father and her husband, who served in the First and Second World Wars, respectively.
Collaborative Project
""This beautiful building is a living demonstration of the power of partnership,"" said Richard Baron, chairman of McCormack Baron Salazar, Inc. ""Under the leadership of Community Solutions, more than 50 partner organizations contributed to making this building a reality - motivated by the mission to give veterans and other low-income residents of the District a place to call home.""
Total development costs were $33 million. Financing included a mix of public and private sources. Public sources include Low-Income Housing Tax Credits, tax-exempt bonds, Federal HOME funds provided through the DC Department of Housing and Community Development, and support from the DC Housing Finance Agency and Department of General Services. Private sector financing sources included Chase Community Development Banking, RBC Capital Markets, Citi Community Development and FHLBank Pittsburgh. Significant philanthropic support came from The Home Depot Foundation, The William S. Abell Foundation, and The Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Foundation, among others.
The building is managed by McCormack Baron Management, Inc. GCS-Sigal served as general contractor.

01/13/2017:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2017/pr17-006.cfm,HUD Issues Final Rule to Help Children Exposed to Lead Paint Hazards,"WASHINGTON - In an effort to respond quickly when young children living in federally housing experience elevated levels of lead in their blood, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today published a new rule lowering the Department's threshold of lead in the child's blood to match the more protective guidance of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). HUD's new action level for lead in a young child's blood has been lowered from 20 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood (µg/dL) to 5. Read HUD's new rule (www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-01-13/pdf/2017-00261.pdf).
This important change to HUD's Lead Safe Housing Rule will allow for a faster response when a young child (specifically, under six years old) is exposed to lead-based paint hazards in their HUD-assisted homes, a key component of a primary prevention strategy.
""Today, we're now able to say that the federal government will speak with one voice when it comes to protecting children from potentially dangerous lead,"" said HUD Secretary Castro. ""By aligning our standard with CDC's guidance, we can respond more quickly in cases when a child who lives in federally assisted housing shows early signs of having elevated levels of lead in their blood.""
Senator Susan Collins of Maine said, ""I am pleased that the Department of Housing and Urban Development has updated its blood lead threshold, a change I have long advocated for, which will help protect countless children from the harmful, often permanent effects of lead poisoning. Since the beginning of my Senate service, I have worked to raise awareness and secure funding to address this largely preventable health problem, which remains one of the most prevalent environmental issues facing children today. We must continue our efforts to eradicate this health threat.""
Senator Richard Durbin of Illinois added, ""Lead poisoning is entirely preventable, yet too many families in America are living with its devastating consequences. We can and must do more to protect our children from this deadly threat and give them a fair shot at reaching their full potential."" said Durbin. ""The measures announced by HUD today will undoubtedly save lives. I commend Secretary Castro for updating the Department's lead level standards and taking concrete steps toward ensuring that children living in federally-subsidized housing are adequately protected from lead exposure.""
Dr. David Jacobs of the National Center for Healthy Housing and the National Safe and Healthy Housing Coalition said, ""This is an important and welcome contribution to the nation's efforts to address childhood lead poisoning. We know how to solve this problem—find the hazards, fix them and provide the human and financial means to make that happen.""
Young children living in HUD-assisted homes have lower blood lead levels than do comparable children in unassisted homes. Still, some young children living in HUD-assisted homes have blood lead levels higher than CDC's threshold. By lowering HUD's reference level to conform to CDC's, the Department will be able to intervene more quickly to stop the negative impact lead can have on the lives of these and other young children.
When a child under age six resides in HUD-assisted housing and has an elevated blood level, the housing provider will have to test the home and other potential sources of the child's lead exposure within 15 days, and ensure that hazards from lead-based paint, dust, or soil are controlled within 30 days. The housing provider must also report the case to HUD so the Department can ensure that follow-up is completed on time. To enable housing providers to prepare for these more stringent requirements, HUD is providing a six-month phase-in period before compliance will be required.
This rule will cover about 3 million HUD-assisted housing units built before 1978, the year lead-based paint was banned for residential use. Of these homes, about 500,000 are estimated to have children under age six residing in them.
HUD has a long history of working to ensure lead-safe housing, which fits into the broader federal response to address lead hazards found in paint, dust and soil, and other sources like water and consumer goods. For 25 years, HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes has worked to improve methods to identify and address home-related health and safety hazards, including those from lead. Since 1993, HUD has awarded more than $1.58 billion in grants to communities for identification and control of lead-based paint hazards in over 190,000 low-income privately owned housing units. In addition, HUD supports research on best practices for identifying and controlling lead-based paint hazards, and conducts an outreach program to get out the message.
HUD's key federal partners share an extensive history of work to prevent children's lead exposure. For example, the CDC's Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program developed programs and policies to prevent childhood lead poisoning and provided funding to state and local health departments to determine the extent of childhood lead poisoning. The Environmental Protection Agency's lead-based paint program has increased the quality of training of lead inspectors, renovation professionals and abatement firms who work on older homes. Summarizing federal lead safety activities, HUD, CDC, EPA, and the 14 additional federal agencies on the President's Task Force on Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks to Children recently published a report on Key Federal Programs to Reduce Childhood Lead Exposures and Eliminate Associated Health Impacts (https://ptfceh.niehs.nih.gov/)."
01/13/2017:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2017/pr17-007.cfm,HUD Announces $15 Million to Test a New Approach to Help Low-Income Seniors Age in Place,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today awarded approximately $15 million to select owners of HUD-assisted senior housing developments to help their low-income senior tenants to age in their own homes and delay or avoid the need for nursing home care. HUD will cover costs related to hiring a full-time Enhanced Service Coordinator and a part-time Wellness Nurse to connect the elderly with the supportive services they need to maintain independent living and age-in-place.
""It is so important that we afford our seniors the opportunity to live independently,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""These grants will help owners of HUD-assisted senior developments to offer the services that will allow seniors to remain in their homes for as long as they can."" Funded through HUD's Supportive Services Demonstration for Elderly Households in HUD-Assisted Multifamily Housing, these three-year grants will produce evidence about the effectiveness of this enhanced supportive services model for elderly households and to evaluate the value of enhanced service coordination paired with affordable housing for seniors. The Demonstration will be independently evaluated to determine the impact of the enhanced supportive services model on:
aging in place in HUD-assisted senior developments; avoiding early transitions to institutional care, and; preventing unnecessary and often costly health care utilization-such as some emergency room visits and hospitalizations-for residents in HUD-assisted senior developments.
• aging in place in HUD-assisted senior developments;
• avoiding early transitions to institutional care, and;
• preventing unnecessary and often costly health care utilization-such as some emergency room visits and hospitalizations-for residents in HUD-assisted senior developments.
HUD and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) collaborated on several research initiatives to inform the design of this demonstration. Lessons from each have informed the resulting experimental research design that has three significant features: 1) the creation of separate groups of enrolled properties: treatment and control; 2) the use of a lottery, or a random assignment, to place eligible properties in these two groups; and 3) the requirement to uniformly implement the demonstration’s core components and ensure adherence to the study design.
The following senior housing developments will receive funding:"
01/13/2017:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2017/pr17-008.cfm,HUD Awards $33 Million to Help End Youth Homelessness,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is awarding $33 million to build systems intended to end youth homelessness in ten local communities, including four rural areas. HUD's Youth Homelessness Demonstration Program (YHDP) (https://www.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/YHDP-Fact-Sheet.pdf) will support a wide range of housing programs including rapid re-housing, permanent supportive housing, transitional housing, and host homes.
""A stable home is the foundation for so many other opportunities in a young person's life,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""As a former mayor, I know that some of the most innovative ideas come from the close working relationships that occur at the local level. These local programs are proof of that.""
""Youth homelessness is one of our nation's most difficult challenges and its size is staggering, with more than 1.3 million young people experiencing homelessness each year,"" said Senator Susan Collins of Maine. ""As the Chairman of the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Subcommittee, I have worked to create and secure funding for important programs like the Youth Homelessness Demonstration Program. By supporting the development of comprehensive plans to prevent and end youth homelessness in communities across the country, this program helps us take a significant step forward in our efforts to reduce homelessness among vulnerable youth.""
Senator Patty Murray of Washington said, ""Youth homelessness is a dire issue confronting our nation, particularly in areas of astronomical rent increases like King County. The Youth Homelessness Demonstration Program, championed by my colleagues Senator Collins and Senator Reed, is an excellent step to increase federal resources to help communities across the country tackle this problem. I am grateful to HUD and to Secretary Castro for his leadership and hard work in making sure these vital resources reach our communities as soon as possible.""
The Youth Homelessness Demonstration Program was developed with youth in mind, relying upon the recommendations provided directly from young people who had experienced homelessness. To ensure that the program meets the needs of young people, HUD incorporated many of the same young people who provided recommendations on the program's design in the application review process. Their assessment helped HUD ensure that applicants actually understood the needs and preferences of the young people they will serve. HUD also worked closely with our Federal partners to help develop the program and review applications, including the Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Department of Education, and the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness.
The ten communities selected will collaborate with a broad array of partners including a youth advisory board and the local or state public child welfare agency. These communities will each develop a coordinated community plan to prevent and end youth homelessness to submit to HUD within six months. They will also participate in a program evaluation to inform the federal effort to prevent and end youth homelessness going forward, and will serve as leaders in the nation on the work of ending homelessness among young people.
The selected communities will use funding for rapid re-housing, permanent supportive housing, and transitional housing, and to fund innovative programs, such as host homes. YHDP will also support youth-focused performance measurement and coordinated entry systems. Selected communities can begin requesting funding for specific projects as soon as they are ready. Over the next several months, selected communities work with their youth advisory boards, child welfare agencies, and other community partners to create a comprehensive community plan to end youth homelessness.
HUD is awarding grants to the following communities where local applicants expressed their own vision for ending youth homelessness:
Anchorage, Alaska (Rural): $1.5 million

01/13/2017:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2017/pr17-009.cfm,HUD Announces Fair Housing Agreement with Whitehall Township in Pennsylvania Resolving Discriminatory Zoning Allegations,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has entered into a Conciliation/Voluntary Compliance Agreement resolving a complaint brought by complainant PathStone, a real estate development corporation based in Rochester, NY, against Whitehall Township and Whitehall Zoning Hearing Board, in Whitehall, Pennsylvania. The complaint alleged that Whitehall engaged in discriminatory zoning practices. Read the Conciliation/Voluntary Compliance Agreement.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in zoning and land use, including setting discriminatory terms and conditions and making housing unavailable, because of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, or familial status. In addition, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act and Section 109 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 require recipients of federal financial assistance not to discriminate and to conduct and administer housing programs in conformity with civil rights laws.
""Municipalities have the critical responsibility to approve housing in a manner that is fair, inclusive and accessible,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""We are pleased that this agreement has been reached and expect it to lead to greater housing opportunities for families interested in making Lehigh Valley home.""
The Agreement settles PathStone's allegations that Whitehall discriminated because of race, national origin, family status, and disability when it denied its request to construct affordable multifamily housing in the Township.
Under the agreement, which will be in place for five years, Whitehall will pay $375,000 to PathStone. It will also, among other things, provide the necessary permits for the housing, actively promote the project on its website and in its quarterly newsletters.
In addition, Whitehall will review its zoning codes with the assistance of a fair housing consultant, provide fair housing training, and remove barriers to the development of affordable housing, so as to ensure compliance with fair housing laws.
People who believe they have experienced housing discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to www.hud.gov/fairhousing, or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple and Android devices."
01/17/2017:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2017/pr17-010.cfm,HUD Charges Kansas Landlords with Discriminating Against a Grandmother,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is charging the property owners, operator, and office manager of a multifamily property in Wichita, Kansas with violating the Fair Housing Act by terminating the lease of a resident who had asked that her grandchild be allowed to live with her. Read HUD's charge.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to discriminate against families with children, including denying or limiting housing to families because they have children under the age of 18, making discriminatory statements, and imposing rules or policies that discriminate against families with children.
""Grandparents shouldn't have their housing taken from them simply because they're guardians of young children,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""This charge reinforces HUD's commitment to ensuring that housing providers meet their obligation to treat families with children the same as any other resident.""
The case came to HUD's attention when a female resident filed a complaint alleging that the owners of Northridge Apartments, a complex in Wichita consisting of 16 one-bedroom units, terminated her lease after she asked if she could add her granddaughter to her lease. The grandmother had obtained custody of the child shortly before she made the request.
HUD's charge alleges the property manager told her that her request ""may be a problem,"" and that the owner ""doesn't want kids on the property."" The charge further alleges that the owners gave notice that they were terminating the lease of another family with a child around the same time.
The case will be heard in federal district court. If it is determined that illegal discrimination has occurred, a judge may award actual and punitive damages, order injunctive or other equitable relief to deter further discrimination, and order that defendants pay the family's attorney fees.
Any person who believes she or he has experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed online or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple and Android devices."
01/18/2017:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2017/pr17-011.cfm,"HUD Announces $10 Million in ""Sweat Equity"" Grants","WASHINGTON - U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Julián Castro today awarded $10 million in ""sweat equity"" grants to four non-profit self-help housing organizations through HUD's Self-Help Homeownership Opportunity Program (SHOP). This funding will create at least 539 affordable homes and significantly lower their purchase price for low-income buyers, who will contribute their own labor toward the construction or rehabilitation of these units.
""Our SHOP grants help advance a fundamental ideal: that every American deserves the chance to build a brighter future by combining opportunity with their own hard work,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""We're proud to help hundreds of families secure an enduring cornerstone of the American Dream.""
The following organizations will receive SHOP funds (see individual descriptions below):
The SHOP program provides federal grants on a competitive basis to national and regional non-profit organizations and consortia that have experience in administering self-help homeownership housing programs. Many SHOP homebuyers are first-time homeowners and come from underserved communities.
Homebuyers will provide significant sweat equity toward the development of their units and/or the units of other homebuyers. Sweat equity and volunteer labor may include, but are not limited to, landscaping, foundation work, painting, carpentry, trim work, and installing drywall, roofing or siding. A minimum of 50 sweat equity hours is required from a household of one person, while a minimum of 100 hours is required from a household of two or more. Community participation consisting of volunteer labor contributions is also required, and reasonable accommodations must be made for persons with disabilities.
Grantees may carry out activities directly and/or distribute SHOP funds to local non-profit affiliates that will develop the SHOP units, select homebuyers, coordinate the homebuyer sweat equity and volunteer efforts, and assist in the arrangement of interim and permanent financing for the homebuyers. Grantees ensure that new homebuyers can afford their homes at the time of purchase and for the long term.
SHOP grants must be used to purchase land and make necessary infrastructure improvements, which together may not exceed an average SHOP investment of $15,000 per dwelling unit. Leveraged funds must be used for the construction or rehabilitation of these homeownership units. All newly constructed units will receive certification as ENERGY STAR qualified units. All appliances, products or features that are installed or replaced will be ENERGY STAR qualified. Water usage products will bear the WaterSense label. Many units will also have ""Green,"" ""Healthy Homes,"" and ""Universal Design"" features.
Since 1996, when Congress first appropriated SHOP funds, the SHOP program has provided more than $396 million in federal grants that, together with significant leveraged funds and numerous volunteer hours, are transforming lives and neighborhoods through the production of more than 28,500 units of affordable housing."
01/19/2017:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2017/pr17-012.cfm,HUD Releases Comprehensive Assessment of Housing Needs of American Indians and Alaska Natives,"WASHINGTON - American Indian tribes are building more housing units after enactment of the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 (NAHASDA) but housing conditions are substantially worse among American Indian households than other U.S. households. These are some of the findings of three new comprehensive reports of tribal housing needs released today by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Urban Institute.
Congress asked HUD to conduct an Assessment of American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian Housing Needs in 2009. The Urban Institute led the study and HUD is releasing three new reports today:
• Housing Needs of American Indians and Alaska Natives in Tribal Areas (https://www.huduser.gov/portal/publications/HNAIHousingNeeds.html)
• Mortgage Lending on Tribal Land (https://www.huduser.gov/portal/publications/NAHSC-Lending.html)
• Housing Needs of American Indians and Alaska Natives in Urban Areas (https://www.huduser.gov/portal/publications/NAHSG-UrbanStudy.html)
Special circumstances on tribal areas—remoteness, lack of infrastructure, complex legal issues and other constraints related to land ownership—make it extremely difficult to improve housing conditions in some areas, according to the reports. Based on the assessments of doubled up households and the number of severely distressed housing units in tribal areas, it is estimated that 68,000 more units are needed to replace severely inadequate units and to eliminate overcrowding in tribal areas.
""This assessment paints a stark picture of the deep and enduring housing needs being experienced by Native American and Alaska Native households,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""It's imperative that we support tribes and continue to produce more quality housing in communities where families are living in overcrowded or unsuitable conditions.""
HUD's assessment includes the first nationally representative survey of American Indian and Alaska Native households in tribal areas. The survey sampled 1,340 households from 38 tribal areas, with a response rate of 60 percent. It offers information not available in existing census data or other data, including the first scientific estimate of the ""doubled-up"" population in Native American households in tribal areas as a way to afford housing or to avoid being homeless on the street.
Data from the national survey was supplemented with Census and American Community Survey data, interviews with 110 tribally designated housing entities, site visits to 22 tribal areas, a study of urban Indians, and a study of barriers to tribal mortgage lending. The assessment is a major milestone in measuring both the extent of the problem and federal efforts to address the housing needs of Native Americans.
""Our research shows that physical conditions of housing and overcrowding remain much worse for American Indians and Alaska Natives living in tribal areas than for other Americans,"" said Nancy Pindus, a senior fellow in the Urban Institute's Metropolitan Housing and Communities Policy Center and the lead researcher for HUD's Assessment of American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian Housing Needs. ""In 1996, federal assistance for housing was changed to a block grant and tribes were given the primary responsibility for planning and operating their housing programs. Tribes have demonstrated that they can construct and rehabilitate housing for their low-income members under this system, but the funding amount has been eroded by inflation.""
Key findings from the Housing Needs of American Indians and Alaska Natives in Tribal Areas report:
Housing conditions vary by region but are substantially worse overall among American Indian and Alaska Native households in tribal areas than among all U.S. households, with overcrowding being especially severe. Physical deficiencies in plumbing, kitchen, heating, electrical, and maintenance issues were found in 23 percent of households in tribal areas, compared to 5 percent of all U.S. households. Overcrowding coupled with another physical condition problem was found in 34 percent of households in tribal areas, compared to 7 percent of all U.S. households. The percentage of households with at least one ""doubled-up"" person staying in the household because they have nowhere else to go was 17 percent, estimated to be up to 84,700 people.

Key findings from the Mortgage Lending on Tribal Land report:
While Native Americans value homeownership as much as other Americans, mortgage lending is limited in Indian Country because reservation land is held in trust and cannot be used to secure a mortgage loan.
• While Native Americans value homeownership as much as other Americans, mortgage lending is limited in Indian Country because reservation land is held in trust and cannot be used to secure a mortgage loan.
Key findings from the Housing Needs of American Indians and Alaska Natives in Urban Areas report:
• Native Americans are becoming more urban but are still less likely to live in a city than other Americans. Even within urban areas, these households often live in census tracts within or near a village or reservation.
• American Indian and Alaska Native households are more likely to occupy worse housing than the rest of the population and more likely to be overcrowded.
• American Indian or Alaska Native individuals leave their village or reservation due to lack of opportunities and some people cycle back and forth between their tribal home and a nearby primary city.
• For Native Americans who struggle to transition from a village or reservation to an urban area, there are a specific set of challenges, including lack of familiarity with urban life and urban housing markets, lack of employment, limited social networks, insufficient rental or credit history, and race-based discrimination.

New Residential Construction data for January 2017 will be released on Thursday, February 16, 2017, at 8:30 A.M. EST.
EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take two months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, 4 months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised about three percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found on our web site listed above.
* 90% confidence interval includes zero. The Census Bureau does not have sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero.

• Read the conciliation agreement with McGowan and Company, based in Fairview Park, Ohio.
• Read the conciliation agreement with Mack, Mack & Waltz Insurance Group based in Deerfield Beach, Florida.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful for providers of housing-related services or products, including insurance providers, to discriminate because of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, and familial status.
The agreements stemmed from a Secretary-Initiated complaint HUD filed after receiving reports the insurance companies' policies and practices had a discriminatory effect because of race and national origin. Specifically, HUD's complaint alleged that the companies refused to provide umbrella coverage, which provides additional liability coverage when an insured's other primary policy limits have been reached, to properties containing subsidized or low-income housing.
Under the agreements, McGowan and Company will remove ""subsidized"" and ""low-income"" from its list of prohibited properties, spend $100,000 to affirmatively market its services and products to the affordable and low-income housing markets and provide fair housing training for management and staff that review and/or approve applications for insurance. Mack & Waltz will spend $10,000 to affirmatively promote its services in affordable and low-income housing markets, and provide fair housing training for its management and staff.

02/07/2017:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2017/pr17-016.cfm,HUD Charges Oklahoma Landlords with Discriminating Against Veteran with Disabilities,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is charging the landlords of a Moore, Oklahoma rental home with violating the Fair Housing Act by denying the reasonable accommodation requests of their tenant, a veteran with disabilities. Read the charge.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from denying or limiting housing to persons with disabilities, or from refusing to make reasonable accommodations in policies or practices for people with disabilities. This includes waiving pet fees for persons with disabilities who use assistance animals.
The case came to HUD's attention when a combat veteran living with a mental disability who uses an emotional support animal filed a complaint alleging that the owners of the house he was renting. The tenant complained that AMH 2015-1 Borrower, LLC, and its management company, AH4R Management - OK, LLC, refused to waive their pet deposit fee. HUD's charge alleges that although the man provided the owners and management company with medical documentation attesting to his need for the animal, they denied his request to waive a $250 pet fee. Under the law, assistance animals are not considered pets.
Disability is the most common basis of fair housing complaint filed with HUD and its partner agencies. Last year alone, HUD and its partners considered over 4,900 disability-related complaints, or more than 58 percent of all fair housing complaints.
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he or she may award damages to the complainant for their loss as a result of the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties in order to vindicate the public interest. If the case is heard in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages to the complainant.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY).

Additionally, this funding will provide an opportunity for local communities to establish and support programs to control other housing-related health and safety hazards.
Unsafe and unhealthy homes affect the health of millions of people of all income levels, geographic areas, and walks of life in the U.S. These homes affect the economy directly, through increased utilization of health care services, and indirectly, through lost wages and increased school days missed. The housing improvements communities will make will help prevent injuries and illnesses, reduce associated health care and social services costs, reduce absentee rates for children in school and adults at work, and reduce stress, all which help to improve the quality of life.
HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes promotes local efforts to eliminate dangerous lead paint hazards and other housing-related health hazards from lower income homes, stimulate private sector investment in lead hazard control, support cutting-edge research on methods for assessing and controlling housing-related health and safety hazards, and educate the public about the dangers of hazards in the home.
The grants to States, local governments and the private sector are being offered through HUD's Lead-Based Paint Hazard Control Program, and Lead Hazard Reduction Demonstration Program. In these grant programs, HUD is providing additional funding (healthy homes supplemental funds) to identify and remediate, in homes where lead-based paint hazards are being controlled, other housing-related health hazards.
HUD expects to make approximately 32 awards under these programs. This estimate assumes funding at the same level as Fiscal Year 2016. The actual number of awards made under this funding notice will depend on the amount of Congress appropriates in the Fiscal Year 2017 budget, the number of eligible applicants, and other factors.
HUD requires prospective grantees to submit their applications electronically at www.grants.gov. Any changes to HUD-published funding notices will be made available to the public through a Federal Register publication and published on this government-wide portal. Applicants are urged to sign up for Grants.gov's notification service to receive periodic updates or changes to these grant offerings."

EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take two months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, 4 months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised about three percent or less.

The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful for any person or other entity whose business includes residential real estate-related transactions to discriminate against any person because of race and national origin.
HOPE Fair Housing Center alleged the bank's lack of a presence in majority African-American and Hispanic communities in the Rockford area made financial products less available to potential applicants based on their race and national origin. The complaint also alleged that of Alpine's 14 branch locations, only one is in a Census tract that is more than 10 percent African American. In addition, HOPE's complaint alleged that the lender provided white applicants with better information, and offered them more favorable terms and conditions than African American and Hispanic applicants.
As part of the HUD-mediated settlement, Alpine Bank will:
Establish a $1 million loan program to increase mortgage lending to residents in majority African-American and Hispanic areas in the Rockford metropolitan area; Pay $75,000 to HOPE; Offer targeted community outreach to minority areas, including seminars relating to financial literacy, homeownership, and credit counseling, and conduct a direct mailing campaign in majority African-American areas; Provide fair lending training for its mortgage lending staff, and; Research the possibility of opening a new automated services branch in a majority-minority neighborhood in the Rockford metropolitan area.

04/04/2017:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2017/pr17-026.cfm,HUD Marks National Fair Housing Month,"WASHINGTON - This year marks the 49th anniversary of the Fair Housing Act, landmark legislation that became law on April 11, 1968. Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) kicked off Fair Housing Month 2017 at its national headquarters. This year's theme is Fair Housing Equals Opportunity, highlighting equality in housing as a foundation upon which aspirations can be achieved and affirming the Fair Housing Act's ongoing role in confronting housing discrimination.
The opening celebration included remarks by HUD Secretary Ben Carson and Malcolm ""Mike"" E. Peabody Jr., who devoted his federal career to finding viable solutions to challenging public policy issues. While serving as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing in the Nixon Administration, Mr. Peabody developed the blueprint for Housing Choice Vouchers, the federal housing voucher program giving low-income families greater housing options and formerly known as Section 8.
""Equal access to housing is a fundamental promise of America,"" said HUD Acting Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity Bryan Greene, who introduced the speakers. ""When access to housing is unfairly limited, it, in turn, limits access to good paying jobs, quality schools, and economic opportunity.""
Through an array of enforcement activities, fair housing policy initiatives, and education and outreach efforts, HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity continues to take action against individuals and housing providers that discriminate. Last year, HUD and its Fair Housing Assistance Program partner agencies received more than 8,000 complaints alleging discrimination based on one or more of the Fair Housing Act's seven protected classes: race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, and disability.
Every type of discrimination robs individuals and families of their right to choose where to live, but one form of discrimination HUD is particularly active in addressing is discrimination against families with children, known as familial status discrimination. Each year, approximately 12 percent of complaints are filed with HUD alleging this type of discrimination. State and local fair housing groups that partner with HUD in fighting discrimination also describe familial status discrimination as being one of their priority areas, as anecdotal evidence shows that it is often a proxy for race discrimination. In addition to the loss of housing, this type of discrimination has a destabilizing effect that prevents families from positioning themselves in ways that enable the next generation to take advantage of all this country has to offer.
HUD is using a number of enforcement tools to expand access to housing choice for families of all sizes, as well as individuals. HUD pursues both Secretary-initiated and consumer-driven complaint enforcement actions to make a wider impact. HUD also directs part of the $42 million in fair housing enforcement and outreach grants it awards each year through the Fair Housing Initiatives Program (FHIP) toward addressing discrimination against families with children. Moreover, a national media campaign developed by a FHIP organization reached major markets across the nation with ads identifying different types of housing discrimination and how to identify it.
Throughout the month, HUD and its state and local fair housing partners will organize local fair housing month celebrations, seminars, and public education events that promote the ideals of fair housing. People who believe they have experienced housing discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and EqualOpportunity at (800) 669-9777. Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed at www.hud.gov/fairhousing."

In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take three months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, six months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2 percent) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percentage change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percentage changes are 90 percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percentage changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised 3 percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau's website (www.census.gov/construction/nrc/how_the_data_are_collected/).

The awards were presented at the Council on Foundations Annual Conference in Dallas, Texas, earlier this morning. They honor 10 innovative and impactful cross-sector initiatives that have increased the quality of life for low- and moderate-income Americans living in urban, suburban, and rural communities across the nation. These initiatives focus on solving a broad range of issues, from expanding affordable housing to promoting employment opportunities for students, reducing substance abuse among young people, and improving local infrastructure.
""I want to congratulate each of our winners for their extraordinary efforts to bridge the gap between philanthropy, government, and nonprofits,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""Today's awards celebrate the power of partnership, and honor exceptional organizations that are laying a strong foundation for more Americans to succeed and thrive.""
""The 10 initiatives being honored are an inspiring reminder that when philanthropy and government work together and lead together in cross-sector partnerships, their collaborations can achieve incredible results for the communities we collectively serve,"" said Council President and CEO Vikki Spruill. ""On behalf of the Council, I congratulate each of the outstanding foundations being awarded today.""
Awards were given to place-based funders for completed or ongoing projects that are executed in partnership with a local, regional, or federal government agency. The winners are:

The Conciliation Agreement resolves allegations the insurers discriminated against the family based on their race and where they lived. Read the agreement.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in rental, sales or home insurance transactions based on a person's race or national origin.
""No homeowner should be made to feel like they won't be able to protect the biggest investment of their lives because of their race or that of their neighbors,"" said Bryan Greene, HUD's General Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue to take steps to ensure that companies that provide products and services for homeowners are aware of and adhere to their obligations under the Fair Housing Act.""
The case began when the married couple filed a complaint with HUD alleging that Fire Insurance Exchange of Woodland Hills, Farmers Insurance Exchange of Westlake Village, and Farmers Group, Inc., of Woodland Hills were unresponsive to their insurance claim after heavy rain caused their roof to collapse. The couple alleged the insurance companies initially delayed responding to their claim, then failed to notify the couple of the disposition of their claim, and ultimately refused to pay their claim because they are African American and live in a Hispanic neighborhood.
Under the Conciliation Agreement, Farmers Insurance Exchange agreed to pay the couple $15,000 in monetary relief.

Read the conciliation agreement.
Refusing to provide a mortgage loan or mortgage insurance because a woman is pregnant or on family leave violates the Fair Housing Act's prohibition against sex and familial status discrimination, which includes discrimination against individuals who have or are expecting a child. Since 2010, HUD received nearly 150 complaints alleging maternity leave discrimination and has obtained more than $8 million in compensation for victims.
""An otherwise qualified borrower should not have their mortgage loan denied or delayed just because they're having a baby,"" said Bryan Greene, HUD's General Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue to protect the rights of families by enforcing the Fair Housing Act and educating the housing industry about their responsibilities under the law.""
The agreement announced today stems from a complaint that a married couple from Santa Ana, California filed with HUD. The couple alleged that Wescom Credit Union unfairly denied their mortgage loan and that the lender requested the woman return to work and provide a current pay stub before they would approve the loan application.
Under the terms of the agreement Wescom will:
Refinance the couple's existing mortgage at a lower rate; Create a $50,000 compensation fund for applicants who were similarly denied loans or withdrew mortgage applications from Wescom during calendar year 2015; Ensure its lending policies regarding parental leave comply with the Fair Housing Act; Provide fair lending training to its employees; and Send a notice to its employees regarding its parental leave lending policies.

05/11/2017:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2017/pr17-033.cfm,Rental Assistance Demonstration Generates $4 Billion in Public-Private Investment in Distressed Public Housing,"WASHINGTON - Each year, thousands of units of public housing are demolished and thousands more sit vacant because they are no longer decent, safe or sanitary. Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced that its Rental Assistance Demonstration officially surpassed $4 billion in capital investment in order to make critical repairs and improvements to this segment of the nation's affordable housing stock.
This level of capital investment in public housing is double the levels HUD announced just last year. Today, RAD is leveraging $19 in capital for every $1 of public housing funds, significantly expanding the ability of local public housing authorities (PHAs) to improve their public housing properties. Without RAD, it would take 46 years for these housing authorities to accomplish the same level of repairs and renewal.
""Through our innovative RAD program, housing authorities can begin to address the backlog of capital repairs needed in their public housing stock,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""Reaching this $4 billion milestone means expanding opportunity for more families and ensuring they have access to quality, healthy, affordable housing.""
RAD allows PHAs to access private investment through public-private partnerships to help preserve and improve public housing properties and address the growing nationwide backlog of deferred maintenance, estimated at $26 billion in 2010. Each year, roughly 10,000 units of public housing are lost due to disrepair. By stemming the loss of these units, RAD helps ensure more low-income families can secure a quality affordable home.
Under RAD, public housing authorities convert some or all of their developments to a project-based Section 8 platform. This change in regulatory platform allows public housing authorities to identify creative ways to solve their capital needs through public-private partnerships, and with no new federal funding. The new, long-term Section 8 contracts that these properties transition to guarantee that the units remain permanently affordable to low-income households. This model is proving to be a versatile tool for PHAs to preserve affordable housing, to serve more eligible households, and maximize the impact of the existing commitment of federal resources. While most conversions involve the modernization and stabilization of existing properties, many PHAs have demolished severely distressed properties and replaced them with new, permanently affordable housing. PHAs are also using RAD to help families move from blighted or isolated locations to neighborhoods of greater opportunity where they will have better access to jobs, transportation and good schools for their children.
For example, the public housing authority in DeKalb County, Georgia used RAD to redevelop a 50-year-old public housing site into mixed-income apartments and single family homes for families and seniors, providing long-term financial stability needed to maintain, preserve, and even add units. Read other case studies here where RAD is working to successfully preserve and improve public housing for low-income families.
HUD has made awards to PHAs across the country for all the 185,000 units currently authorized to participate in RAD and estimates an additional $6 billion in new, largely privately funded construction investments will be made in the public housing units currently authorized to participate in RAD. In response to high demand from housing authorities to utilize RAD, the FY17 omnibus budget signed by the President on May 5th raises the RAD cap to 225,000 from 185,000 units. This will allow additional eligible public housing properties to be preserved and improved through RAD.

05/11/2017:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2017/pr17-035.cfm,2017 HUD Secretary Design Award Winners Announced,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the American Institute of Architects (AIA) today announced three model housing developments in California, Missouri, and Washington State as the recipients of the 2017 HUD Secretary's Housing and Community Design Award (https://www.huduser.gov/portal/about/housingCommDesign-intro.html). Each of these developments are recognized for excellence in affordable or accessible housing design.
""I want to applaud each of today's winners for their bold vision and innovative plans to expand housing opportunity for lower income households,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""We hope these developments will inspire designers across the nation to recognize that affordable housing can enhance the fabric of their communities by combining form with function.""
The new HUD Secretary's Housing and Community Design Award recipients are:
Excellence in Affordable Housing Design Award - This award recognizes architecture that demonstrates overall excellence in terms of design in response to both the needs and constraints of affordable housing.
Monteverde Senior Apartments in Hayward, CA is a 67-unit community providing much-needed affordable, age-qualified housing. The development is an architectural feat, located on a hillside with more than 17% slope, a 40-foot grade increase - challenging for building a residence for seniors. Its contemporary design melds with the existing structures, working well with the multi-tiered site and meandering paths designed to connect with the surrounding community. A transit-oriented development, the location links residents to BART and downtown Orinda services. The building is also designed with a Green Point Rated score of 150+, with sustainable features including solar hot water and photovoltaic systems. As the first new senior affordable housing development in three decades, all units were leased within weeks of opening, demonstrating the need for affordable senior housing in the area. The community is the first of hopefully many more senior affordable housing opportunities for those most in need.
Creating Community Connection Award - This award recognizes projects that incorporate housing within other community amenities for the purpose of either revitalization or planned growth.
Plaza Roberto Maestas is a landmark equitable transit-oriented development project in Seattle's Beacon Hill neighborhood. The project incorporates the community's vision into a new mixed-use development in a rapidly gentrifying neighborhood. Completed in September 2016, Plaza Roberto Maestas consists of two six-story buildings that flank an outdoor plaza, which opens onto a Festival Street adjacent to a light rail station. Through nearly eight years of planning with the community, El Centro de la Raza transformed a surfacing parking lot into a multicultural hub for the neighborhood that incorporates 112 units of affordable housing, local small business retail and office, community space, and a bilingual child development center. Plaza Roberto Maestas directly addresses the urgent need for affordable housing and economic opportunity in the Beacon Hill neighborhood and is a model for community-inspired transit-oriented development.
Community-Informed Design - This award recognizes design that supports physical communities as they rebuild inner city social structures and relationships that may have been weakened by outmigration, disinvestment, and the isolation of inner city areas.
Sited on one of the last failed public housing high-rise structures in St. Louis, the Flance Early Learning Center aspires to proactively alter the course of the most impoverished zip code in Missouri. The design process involved meetings with community leaders, volunteers, and private partners to address the needs of children and the neighborhood. The program's instruction, daycare, nutrition education, and integrated wellness center for 164 children of mixed-incomes is unique among other childcare centers. The massing of the center provides an abstracted, organic-formed facade which creates a shaded interstitial porch for each classroom's outdoor access. Like dappling light through a tree canopy, perforated metal filters the light, shading the south and west-facing glass, contributing to the facility's pending LEED® certification. A sophisticated yet playful palate fills the interior with light and energy, allowing the building to remain a canvas for learning and creating."

05/16/2017:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2017/pr17-037.cfm,HUD Charges New Hampshire Landlords with Discriminating Against Families with Children,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is charging a group of New Hampshire landlords with housing discrimination for denying families with children the opportunity to rent certain apartments. HUD alleges that MSM Brothers, Inc., the owner of a 192-unit apartment complex in Dover, New Hampshire, and its on-site manager engaged in housing discrimination by limiting rental options for applicants with young children. Read the charge.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from denying or limiting housing to families with children under age 18.
""Families shouldn't be restricted to particular units of a housing development or subjected to different rental terms just because they have children,"" said Bryan Greene, HUD's General Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD is committed to protecting the housing rights of families with children and will continue to take appropriate enforcement action whenever those rights are violated.""
The case came to HUD's attention when a mother filed a complaint alleging that she had been denied the opportunity to rent a two-bedroom unit at White Cliffs at Dover. After an investigation, HUD filed a charge on behalf of the woman, alleging that after White Cliffs' manager learned that she had an infant son, he told her that she could only rent one of the first-floor units, none of which was available. The charge further asserts that New Hampshire Legal Assistance Fair Housing Project conducted testing which revealed similar treatment of testers posing as prospective renters with children.
Each year, approximately 12 percent of the complaints that are filed with HUD allege familial status discrimination.
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless either party elects for the case to be heard in federal court. If the administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, the judge may award damages to the complainant for her loss as a result of the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties to vindicate the public interest.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY).

The grants announced today are provided through HUD's Community Development Block Grant - Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) Program. Combined with CDBG-DR grants already allocated, HUD's investment to these areas totals nearly $3 billion.
CDBG-Disaster Recovery grants can support a wide variety of activities including housing redevelopment, business assistance and infrastructure repair. State and local governments in Louisiana, West Virginia, Texas, North Carolina, South Carolina and Florida will target these grants in ""the most impacted"" areas. HUD's allocations are based on the unmet costs to repair seriously damaged properties and infrastructure in the counties determined by HUD to be most impacted.
""Today, HUD makes another investment to support long-term disaster recovery in communities that continue to experience significant and persistent need,"" said Secretary Carson. ""Supporting the people and places still struggling to rebuild is a top priority at HUD.""
HUD is allocating the following disaster recovery funds:
Background
On May 5th, President Trump signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2017, which included $400 million to support recovery from major disasters in 2015 and later. The Act directs HUD to allocate the remaining funds ($236.3 million) at a future date to areas that experience disasters meeting the 'most impacted' threshold HUD announced last January. Read HUD's January 18, 2017 notice (https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-01-18/pdf/2017-01007.pdf).
This $400 million is in addition to a total of $2.6 billion in CDBG-DR funding previously appropriated to assist in recovery from major disasters in 2015 and 2016. Read HUD's news release for details of these prior allocations.
To determine these disaster recovery allocations, HUD analyzes the most currently available data of the unmet costs to repair seriously damaged properties and infrastructure in the most-impacted counties. HUD will shortly publish a notice in the Federal Register which will define the criteria for the use of these funds."

Two related complaints filed with HUD alleged that the manager of the Four Palms Apartments in Mountain View, California, made discriminatory statements about Latino residents and prohibited their children from playing outside. Read the Conciliation Agreement.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in rental, sales or home lending transactions based on a person's national origin or familial status. This includes discrimination based on a person's ancestry or country of birth, and discrimination against families with children under the age of 18.
""A family's right to enjoy their home shouldn't depend on where they are from or whether they have children,"" said Bryan Greene, HUD's General Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD is committed to taking action to ensure the policies and practices of housing providers follow the law.""
The case came to HUD's attention when two Latino couples that live at the Four Palms Apartments filed a complaint alleging that the owner and the manager of the complex discriminated against them because of their national origin and because they have children. In addition, Project Sentinel, a Santa Clara, California-based fair housing group, filed a complaint on behalf of the residents, alleging that the manager of Four Palms Apartments repeatedly made statements indicating that he did not like having Latino tenants at the property because they did not speak English, and accusing them of bringing pests, including bed bugs and rats, to the property.
Project Sentinel further alleged that the manager prohibited children from playing at the property, enforced overly restrictive rules that singled out children, and terminated the lease of one of the Latino families that filed a complaint after their two-year-old daughter became agitated and cried loudly when the manager walked by the family's door.
Under the Conciliation Agreement, the owner will pay a total of $20,000 and revise the Four Palm's rules to comply with the Fair Housing Act. In addition, the property's manager will complete fair housing training.
People who believe they have experienced housing discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY).

The President's 2018 Budget continues to provide rental assistance for 4.5 million households while recognizing a greater role for State and local governments, and the private sector, to address community and economic development needs. Read HUD's proposed FY 2018 Budget on HUD's website.
HUD's request includes $40.68 billion in gross discretionary funding for the Department. The proposed reductions would be implemented primarily through rental assistance reforms and eliminating funding for programs. Additional savings are associated with streamlining HUD's own internal operations. Meanwhile, the Budget seeks $2.25 billion to help local communities house and serve persons and families who are experiencing homelessness.
""This Budget reflects this Administration's commitment to fiscal responsibility while continuing HUD's core support of our most vulnerable households,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""We will work very closely with Congress to support the critical work of our agency as we vigorously pursue new approaches to help work-eligible households achieve self-sufficiency.""
Reforming Rental Assistance Programs
The Budget proposes to continue support for 4.5 million HUD-assisted households while offering a set of policy reforms to reduce costs to taxpayers. These policies cover HUD's Housing Choice Voucher (HCV), Public Housing Operating/Capital Fund, Project-Based Rental Assistance (PBRA), Housing for the Elderly (Section 202) and Housing for Persons with Disabilities (Section 811) programs. The Administration seeks to provide funding flexibilities and relieve regulatory and other cost burdens on public housing authorities. The Budget also proposes changes to tenant rent contributions, with some protections for those who experience hardships. Together, these policies serve as a starting point as HUD works to modernize an outdated and complex support system.
The Administration proposes removing the statutory limit on the number of public housing units that can participate in HUD's Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD). Currently, only 225,000 units of public housing can take advantage of this affordable housing preservation program. RAD is an important strategy to recapitalize the nation's at-risk public housing stock, which requires billions of dollars to make critical repairs and improvements. In RAD's short history, the program has generated more than $4 billion in private investment in public housing, preserving more than 61,000 units of affordable housing. The 2018 Budget also requests that senior housing developments participating in HUD's Section 202 Program become eligible to participate in RAD to help preserve housing for the elderly. Read more about RAD.
Supporting Homeownership and Fair Housing
The 2018 Budget continues to support homeownership through the FHA mortgage insurance programs, providing up to $400 billion in new loan guarantee authority and making changes to strengthen FHA's Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) or 'reverse mortgage' program. The Budget includes a $30 million administrative fee to support the modernization of FHA's aging systems, some that are based upon the outdated COBOL programming language.
In addition, the Budget seeks $500 billion in new guarantee authority for Ginnie Mae, a part of HUD. Ginnie Mae makes affordable housing a reality for millions of low- and moderate-income households across America by channeling global capital into the nation's housing markets. Specifically, Ginnie Mae provides significant liquidity, allowing lenders to obtain a better price for their mortgage loans in the secondary mortgage market. The lenders can then use the proceeds to fund new mortgage loans. Without this liquidity, lenders would be forced to keep all loans in their own portfolio, meaning they would not have adequate capital to make new loans.
The Administration is also seeking $65.3 million to support HUD's fair housing mission, the same funding level provided in the prior three years.
Eliminating/Reducing Ineffective Programs
The Administration is seeking the elimination of the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program, devolving the activities the block grant program supports to the State and local level. Since 1980, and most recently in 2013, HUD studies found that CDBG is increasingly not well targeted to the poorest communities and has not demonstrated a measurable impact on communities. Similarly, the Budget proposes the elimination of HUD's Choice Neighborhoods Initiative, HOME Investment Partnerships Program, and the Self-Help Homeownership Opportunity Program (SHOP), because State and local governments are better-positioned to serve their communities' needs.
Controlling Lead Hazards and Promoting Healthy Homes
To protect families and their young children from potentially dangerous lead-based paint hazards, the Budget requests $130 million to promote healthy and lead-safe housing.
Finding Efficiencies
The Budget provides $1.32 billion for HUD's internal operations. The request also provides $250 million for the Department's Information Technology Fund, including $10 million for cybersecurity and modernization investments to help local public housing authorities and managing risks in the Federal Housing Administration's (FHA) mortgage insurance programs.

The theme of National Homeownership Month 2017 is ""Find Your Place in a New Era of Homeownership."" Read the President's Homeownership Month Proclamation (https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/05/31/president-donald-j-trump-proclaims-june-2017-national-homeownership).
Today, U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson kicked off the month-long recognition by hosting an academic forum on the state of homeownership in the U.S. following the housing crisis, specifically the challenges Millennials face as they enter the market in greater numbers. Watch HUD's National Homeownership Forum (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5NoQlWvRjY&feature=youtu.be).
""After all we've been through, homeownership remains an American value and the cornerstone of our economy,"" said Secretary Carson. ""Today, we recognize the abiding value of owning a home, and rededicate ourselves toward ensuring that every hardworking and credit-worthy American enjoys a fair chance at becoming a homeowner.""
President Trump is committed to growing America's middle class and strengthening the national housing market. The 2018 Budget continues to support homeownership through the Federal Housing Administration's mortgage insurance programs, providing up to $400 billion in new loan guarantee authority. In addition, the Budget seeks $500 billion in new guarantee authority for Ginnie Mae, a part of HUD. Ginnie Mae makes affordable housing a reality for millions of low- and moderate-income households by channeling global capital into the nation's housing markets. Specifically, Ginnie Mae provides significant liquidity, allowing lenders to obtain a better price for their mortgage loans in the secondary mortgage market. The lenders can then use this liquidity to fund new mortgage loans.
Since its creation in 1934, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) has helped more than 46 million Americans purchase or refinance their homes. Last year alone, FHA insured more than 1.2 million home loans, totaling $245 billion. An estimated 40 percent of all first-time homebuyers use FHA; 47 percent of home purchases by African American households are FHA-insured borrowers; and nearly half of Hispanic homebuyers rely upon an FHA-insured mortgage to purchase their homes.

06/05/2017:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2017/pr17-043.cfm,HUD Designates June as National Healthy Homes Month,"WASHINGTON - In an effort to help families keep their kids healthy and to reinforce the connection between a family's health and their home, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is kicking off the second annual National Healthy Homes Month. Throughout the month, the goal is to raise awareness for what makes a home healthy, and to strengthen coordination and collaboration between housing and health at the federal, state and local levels.
Launched by HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes (OLHCHH), National Healthy Homes Month 2017 will focus national attention on ways to keep people of all ages safe and healthy in their homes. To mark this month-long campaign, HUD Secretary Ben Carson, produced a video highlighting the direct link to a family's health and their home. Watch HUD Secretary Carson's video message (https://youtu.be/nyYDEwJ-yRc).
This year's theme, ""Just What the Doctor Ordered,"" highlights the vital role that pediatricians and the health community play in healthy homes education. Due to home-related health risks such as asthma and lead poisoning, some of the most serious health problems for children may start at home. Creating healthier housing promotes the healthy growth and development of kids.
""National Healthy Homes Month serves as an important educational call to action,"" said Jon L. Gant, Director of HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes. ""Providing families with the resources they need to keep their homes safe from potential health hazards such as lead-based paint and pests helps them to create the healthiest family and home possible.""
A healthy home is one that provides a safe and healthy environment and helps to prevent disease and injury. Currently, millions of American homes have moderate to severe housing problems, including lead-based paint hazards; a dilapidated structure; roofing problems; heating, plumbing, and electrical deficiencies; water leaks and intrusion; pests; damaged paint; and high radon gas levels. These conditions are associated with a wide range of health issues, including unintentional injuries and respiratory illnesses like radon-induced lung cancer.
Recently, HUD's office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes developed a National Healthy Homes Month Planning Guide, which contains many resources and materials to assist with building awareness and implementation at the local level.

06/07/2017:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2017/pr17-044.cfm,HUD Approves Agreement Between Nevada Fair Housing Group and Landlords to Resolve Complaints of Housing Discrimination,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today an agreement between a Nevada fair housing organization and the owner and manager of four apartment complexes in Reno, Nevada. The agreement settles allegations of housing discrimination against prospective tenants with disabilities who require assistance animals. Read the conciliation agreement.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from denying housing to people with disabilities or imposing different rental terms and conditions. This includes refusing to make reasonable accommodations in policies or practices for people with disabilities.
""Residents who require assistance animals shouldn't have their housing rights denied to them,"" said Bryan Greene, HUD General Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue working to ensure that landlords meet their obligation to comply with the Fair Housing Act's requirements.""
The case came to HUD's attention when the Silver State Fair Housing Council filed four complaints against the owner and manager of Silver Lake Apartments, Vale Townhomes, Oak Manor Apartments and Angel Street Apartments. These complaints allege ERGS, Inc. and Silver Lake Apartments, LLC discriminated against prospective tenants who required assistance animals by requiring applicants who required support animals to pay a pet deposit fee.
In addition to the Fair Housing Act's protections, HUD provided guidance in April 2013 reaffirming that housing providers must provide reasonable accommodations to people with disabilities who require assistance animals. Read HUD's notice.
Under the conciliation agreement, ERGS, Inc. will pay Silver State Fair Housing Council $20,500. ERGS, Inc., and Silver Lake Apartments, LLC, will also adopt a written policies that are consistent with the Fair Housing Act and provide fair housing training for all employees who interact with tenants or applicants.
Disability is the most common basis of fair housing complaint filed with HUD and its partner agencies. Last year alone, HUD and its partners considered over 4,900 disability-related complaints, or more than 58 percent of all fair housing complaints that were filed.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to www.hud.gov/fairhousing, or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple and Android devices."

EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take three months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, six months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2 percent) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percentage change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percentage changes are 90 percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percentage changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised 2 percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau's website (www.census.gov/construction/nrc/how_the_data_are_collected/).

06/19/2017:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2017/pr17-047.cfm,HUD Report Calls for Greater Action to Reduce Injuries to Seniors in the Home,"WASHINGTON - Approximately one-third of adults age 65 years or older fall in their home, resulting in injury, long-term disability and premature institutionalization. By 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates the cost related to these kinds of injuries to be nearly $60 billion a year. In an effort to reduce and prevent falls and their associated costs, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today released a wide-ranging report recommending a more holistic approach to seniors aging-in-place and their health needs.
Released during National Healthy Homes Month, HUD's report, Overcoming Obstacles to Policies for Preventing Falls by the Elderly, recommends government and philanthropic organizations work together at every level to integrate fall prevention strategies and support efforts to aging-in-place, senior safety at home, and continuous care models.
""Active programs that coordinate senior care and implement fall prevention strategies can benefit seniors enormously,"" said Jon L. Gant, Director of the Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes. ""This report helps policy makers and program managers to identify the causes of problems they may encounter, as well as the resources and methods they can use to overcome them."" Additionally, HUD's report contains a toolkit highlighting numerous funding sources and the rationale for outreach to non-traditional partners to improve delivery of services and care to seniors. The toolkit covers four key areas:
Why senior falls prevention and coordinated care is an important issue for the nation and what some communities are doing to meet the needs of seniors; What partners and stakeholders should be engaged, what each can offer to this effort, and why a holistic approach may provide the best potential; What financial resources, from all levels of government to health insurers and philanthropies, may be available to help create and sustain effective policies and programs; and How to sustain policies and programs over the long-term.

06/27/2017:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2017/pr17-049.cfm,HUD Awards $127 Million to Protect Children and Families from Dangerous Lead and Other Home Hazards,"WASHINGTON - In a continuous effort to keep families and their children safe from lead-based paint and other home health and safety hazards, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today awarded more than $127 million to 48 state and local government agencies (see chart below).
The grant funding announced today will reduce the number of children with elevated blood lead levels, and protect nearly 7,600 families living in homes with significant lead and other home health and safety hazards. HUD's Lead Based Paint Hazard Control grant programs have a proven history of success, filling critical needs in communities where no other resources exist to address substandard housing that threatens the health of the most vulnerable residents.
Today in Washington, DC, HUD Secretary Ben Carson announced the new funding during an event that featured a panel discussion about the importance of public and private partnerships to the work of healthy homes. With HUD celebrating June's National Healthy Homes Month, Carson said he wants tomake lead paint hazard removal a top priority.
""Children perform better at school and in life if they live in a healthy home,"" said Secretary Carson. ""A healthy start at home translates to a successful life outside of the home. HUD is committed to working with local communities to eradicate lead paint poisoning to make sure our homes are safe and ensure positive outcomes for families and their kids.""
""Millions of families and children are seeing their hope for the future threatened by poor health simply because of where they live,"" noted Jon L. Gant, Director of HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes. ""This round of funding includes awards to eight cities that are receiving grant awards for the first time. We are pleased the program is expanding into these previously unserved communities.""
Unsafe and unhealthy homes affect the health of millions of people of all income levels, geographic areas, and walks of life in the U.S. These homes affect the economy directly through increased utilization of health care services, and indirectly through lost wages and increased school days missed. Housing improvements help prevent injuries and illnesses, reduce associated health care and social services costs, reduce absentee rates for children in school and adults at work, and reduce stress—all which help to improve the quality of life.
HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes promotes local efforts to eliminate dangerous lead paint and other housing-related health hazards from lower income homes; encourages private sector investment in lead hazard control; supports cutting-edge research on methods for assessing and controlling housing-related health and safety hazards; and educates the public about the dangers of hazards in the home.
The funding announced today directs critical funds to cities, counties and states to eliminate dangerous lead paint and other housing-related health hazards in thousands of privately-owned, low-income housing units. As part of these awards, HUD is providing these Lead Based Paint Hazard Control grantees just over $14 million in Healthy Homes supplemental funding to help communities mitigate multiple health hazards in high-risk housing simultaneously,in conjunction with their lead hazard control activities."
06/30/2017:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2017/pr17-050.cfm,U.S. and Japan to Collaborate on Aging in Place,"WASHINGTON - The United States and Japan face the common challenges associated with an aging population, and both nations are exploring ways to expand housing opportunities to allow seniors to remain in their own homes and 'age in place.' Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and Japan formally agreed to work cooperatively on researching innovated approaches to housing both nation's vulnerable senior population. Read the Memorandum of Cooperation (MOC).
HUD Secretary Ben Carson; Hisayuki Fujii, Parliamentary Vice Minister of Japan's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transportation and Tourism (MLIT); Maren Kasper, Acting President of Ginnie Mae; and, Masahiro Nakajima, President of Japan's Urban Renaissance Agency (UR) signed the agreement today at HUD's headquarters. In addition, the Japan Housing Finance Agency will participate in the joint research effort.
""Our nations have much to learn from each other, and we recognize that our strength is measured by our regard, respect and care of the elderly,"" said HUD Secretary Carson. ""Working together, the U.S. and Japan will combine our strengths to find new and innovative approaches to housing our older citizens.""
Specific areas of research include:
Discovering innovative approaches to financing aging in place Identifying the connections between health and housing Seeking effective public-private partnerships Focusing on healthy and accessible communities, and Developing viable policies in a constrained budget environment
• Discovering innovative approaches to financing aging in place
• Identifying the connections between health and housing
• Seeking effective public-private partnerships
• Focusing on healthy and accessible communities, and
• Developing viable policies in a constrained budget environment
""Based on this agreement, MLIT is going to start concrete studies of aging in place. UR's initiatives in local communities will provide valuable insight as well,"" said Keiichi Ishii, Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transportation and Tourism (MLIT).
The bilateral partnership will promote increased knowledge and innovation in both countries. One example already underway in the United States is HUD's Supportive Services Demonstration for Elderly Households in HUD-Assisted Multifamily Housing, designed to evaluate the effect of housing with services on low-income elderly populations. The Demonstration will provide researchers with information to assess how an enhanced service coordinator and wellness nurse affects residents' health care utilization. HUD's partnership with Japan will leverage this type of information, sharing it with an international audience and allowing the two countries to learn together.
Although Japan's approach has relied more on government entities to deliver services and resources, the United States relies heavily on the private and nonprofit sectors, as well as volunteers, to support older adults. By gaining a greater understanding of each country's approach to this challenge, both the United States and Japan will be able to take advantage of new ideas, innovative strategies, and evidence-based policies, allowing each country to better support and finance the needs of their populations as they age.
Officials from Japan and the U.S. signed an agreement to conduct joint research on aging in place and housing finance."
07/06/2017:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2017/pr17-051.cfm,HUD Awards $50 Million in Housing Counseling Grants,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today awarded more than $50 million in housing counseling grants to hundreds of national, regional and local organizations to help families and individuals with their housing needs and to prevent future foreclosures. HUD's housing counseling grants and the additional funding they leverage will assist more than 1.4 million households find housing, make more informed housing choices, or keep their current homes. See list of all counseling agencies awarded funding today.
""This is a smart investment in helping families find and keep their homes,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""Quite simply, knowledge is power. We know that armed with the information they need, those who receive counseling services are far more successful in buying, renting or avoiding foreclosure.""
More than $47 million of the grants announced today will directly support the housing counseling services provided by 31 national and regional organizations, six multi-state organizations, 19 State Housing Finance Agencies (SHFAs) and 199 local housing counseling agencies. In addition, HUD is awarding $3.5 million to four national organizations to train housing counselors who will receive the instruction and certification necessary to effectively assist families with their housing needs.
National and regional agencies distribute much of HUD's housing counseling grant funding to community-based organizations that assist low- and moderate-income families to improve their housing conditions. In addition, these larger organizations help improve the quality of housing counseling services and enhance coordination among counseling providers. Read a comprehensive summary of each grant. Read a comprehensive summary of each housing counseling grant.
Counseling improves housing outcomes for homebuyers, homeowners, and renters. Last year, HUD published research findings summarizing the impact of housing counseling has on families' housing options and choices. In addition, recent research from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and the Urban Institute continues to find substantial benefits to housing counseling for families who purchase their first homes and those struggling to prevent foreclosure.
Grant recipients address the full range of families' housing counseling needs. This includes helping homebuyers evaluate their readiness for a home purchase, understand their financing and down payment options, and navigate what can be an extremely confusing and difficult homebuying process. The organization also help households find affordable rental housing and offer financial literacy training to individuals and families struggling to repair credit problems that restrict their housing options.
In addition to providing counseling to homeowners and renters, these organizations assist homeless persons in finding the transitional housing they need to move toward a permanent place to live. Finally, grantees also assist senior citizens seeking reverse mortgages. These agencies provide counseling for the rapidly growing number of elderly homeowners who seek to convert equity in their homes into income that can be used to pay for home improvements, medical costs, and other living expenses.
Housing counseling agencies also support fair housing by assisting borrowers in reviewing their loan documentation, to avoid potential mortgage scams, unreasonably high interest rates, inflated appraisals, unaffordable repayment terms, and other conditions that can result in a loss of equity, increased debt, default, and even foreclosure. Likewise, foreclosure prevention counseling helps homeowners facing delinquency or default employ strategies, including expense reduction, negotiation with lenders and loan servicers, and loss mitigation, to avoid foreclosure.

In addition, HUD's Departmental Enforcement Center suspended owner John Seckel from doing business with the Federal government.
These actions are the result of an investigation by HUD into the financial practices of Seckel and his company, based in Newtown, Pennsylvania. Specifically, that Seckel knowingly and fraudulently submitted false financial statements to the government certifying there were audited by an independent accounting firm when, in fact, they were not.
HUD found that Seckel Capital and John Seckel engaged in a years-long pattern of submitting false financial statement to FHA, representing them as properly audited by independent certified public accountants. The action against Seckel and his company is the result of HUD's ongoing effort to hold the mortgage industry accountable for the loans they originate, underwrite and/or service.

07/12/2017:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2017/pr17-052.cfm,HUD Announces Winners of 2017 Healthy Homes Awards,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development(HUD) and the National Environmental Health Association (NEHA) today announced that four model programs around the nation are recipients of the HUD Secretary's Award for Healthy Homes (www.neha.org/about-neha/awards/hud-award-healthy-homes), an award recognizing excellence in making indoor environments healthier through healthy homes. For the third consecutive year, HUD and NEHA identified outstanding local programs that promote healthier housing through research, education or innovated practices.
HUD and NEHA selected the following programs:
• Denver Housing Authority's South Lincoln Neighborhood Redevelopment Mariposa project;
• Vermont Weatherization's One Touch Program;
• Tribal Healthy Homes Network's Partnership for Air Matters in Alaska; and,
• Rutgers University, Bed Bug Monitoring Protocol and Model Integrated Pest Management Program.
The awards were presented today at NEHA's 2017 Annual Educational Conference and Exhibition in Grand Rapids, Michigan.
HUD has a strong partnership with NEHA based on a common vision of creating healthier home environments by working across the health, environment, and housing sectors. The award was initiated in 2015 to showcase results achieved under a wide range of housing and indoor environmental health programs.
""The recipients of this award understand the strong connection between where we live and how healthy we are,"" said HUD Secretary Dr. Ben Carson. ""They demonstrate innovative approaches to making homes healthier, and exemplify the outstanding work that's taking place throughout the nation.""
Nominations and applications were received from academic institutions, state government agencies, housing authorities, and community based organizations. A distinguished nine-judge panel, representing a cross-section of experts from the healthy homes community, evaluated entries. For more information about the award process and the panel, please visit NEHA's website (www.neha.org/about-neha/awards/hud-award-healthy-homes).
Among the key criteria for the awards are measurability, health impact on population, policy/program innovation, impact on physical environment, economic sustainability, and partnership/collaboration.
The awardees are:
Denver Housing Authority (Denver, CO)
The Denver Housing Authority and partners designed the South Lincoln Neighborhood Redevelopment Mariposa project that revitalized 270 public housing units/South Lincoln homes, transforming it from an area of concentrated poverty near downtown Denver into a vibrant, healthy, mixed-income community. This effort included increasing access to health care and public transit, and developing a resource efficient, desirable, and safe neighborhood. The design also achieved multiple health related objectives, such as reducing noise, increasing physical activity, and reinforcing a social support network. A Health Impact Assessment was used to assess the impacts of policies, redevelopment projects and programs on population health, and in the overall building and design process.
Vermont Weatherization One Touch Program (Vermont)
Vermont Weatherization One Touch works with weatherization/energy, healthy, and housing home visiting and repair programs to increase family access to health and energy efficiency services. Since its inception in 2014, over 1,300 families have received a One Touch checkup. The program is the first in the nation to incorporate healthy homes assessments into all state supported weatherization projects in single family homes and provide residents with a seamless referral to address their other healthy or housing needs. Government and non-profits partners that ""touch"" homes use a common home checkup and referral system to make sure their clients get the health, housing, and energy services they need from the 20 One Touch partner programs. One Touch checkups are completed during every single-family weatherization project, lead hazard repair jobs, and selected housing rehab projects that target low-income families.
Tribal Healthy Homes Network (Washington)
The Tribal Healthy Homes Network (THHN) is a tribal consortium formed in 2008 to address the grave concerns about rising rates of asthma in native communities. Mold contamination was a widespread problem and a likely factor in the asthma epidemic among American Indians and Alaska Natives. In 2014, THHN began looking for innovations to reach the thousands of tribal families living with poor indoor air quality (IAQ), recurrent lung infections and hospitalizations. The tribes trained by THHN were consistently asking, ""I may understand IAQ better now, but how do I get members of my community to understand?""
THHN collaborated with an international health organization to develop a Healthy Homes Toolkit. The toolkit bundles key IAQ tools, reflecting input and from 28 Alaska Native Communities to encourage realistic use in households, as well as from agencies and technical experts. The toolkits were rapidly adopted or emulated by local and state health programs, and others nationwide. Since 2014, over 500 Healthy Homes Toolkits have been distributed to rural communities; weatherization programs; Women, Infants and Children (WIC) clients; and many other groups.
Rutgers University (New Brunswick, NJ)
Bed bug infestations have both significant medical and economic impacts. Bed bug bites cause pain, itchiness, loss of sleep, and psychological distress. The cost of controlling bed bug infestations is a serious financial burden in low-income communities. In addition, cockroaches contaminate food and produce allergens that are asthma triggers.
Among HUD's priority research areas is ""Assessing or improving the efficiency of current methods for residential Integrated Pest Management (IPM)."" Under the leadership of Dr. Changlu Wang, the Urban Entomology lab at Rutgers University cooperated with low-income communities, manufacturers, and other universities in developing and improving the adoption of more effective IPM programs.
In 2013, the team was awarded a HUD grant titled ""Implementation and Evaluation of a Model Bed Bug Management Program in Low-Income Housing."" This study, which ended in 2016, partnered with three housing authorities in New Jersey with a total of over 2,000 apartments. It designed and implemented a low-cost, and highly effective bed bug monitoring protocol and a model IPM program. This protocol was published in a peer-reviewed journal (Wang et al. 2016).
Next year's awards will be presented at the NEHA conference, June 25-28, 2018, at the Marriott Anaheim Hotel in Anaheim, California. For more information about OLHCHH and our resources, please visit www.hud.gov/healthyhomes."
07/14/2017:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2017/pr17-055.cfm,HUD Makes $2 Billion Available to Local Homeless Programs,"WASHINGTON - In an effort to prevent and effectively end homelessness, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is making $2 billion available to support thousands of local homeless assistance programs nationwide. Funded through the Continuum of Care (CoC) Homeless Assistance Program, HUD's funding notice continues to encourage local applicants to use a Housing First approach to help individuals and families move quickly into permanent housing. Read HUD's Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) on HUD's website.
HUD's Continuum of Care homeless assistance grants support a wide variety of local programs from street outreach and assessment programs to transitional and permanent housing for individuals, including, veterans, youth, families, and persons experiencing long-term or chronic homelessness.
""We know these grants can make a huge difference in ending homelessness"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""HUD continues to forge deep relationships with our local partners to invest in proven programs that are working to reduce the scale of homelessness in their communities.""
HUD continues to place a major emphasis on ending homelessness for all persons experiencing homelessness, creating a systematic response to homelessness and improving how resources are used to end homelessness. These priorities will make it much more competitive and increase incentives for communities to improve their performance. As part of these priorities, HUD is continuing incentives to adopt best practices for rapid-rehousing and Housing First, an approach that has proven effective in helping communities to make progress on their goal of ending homelessness.
Additionally, HUD isencouraging communities to end veteran, chronic, family, and youth homelessness and to use their data to strategically target their available resources to end homelessness. Finally, to help communities reach these goals, there is greater flexibility provided to create a variety of new projects that will allow recipients to serve different populations of individuals and families experiencing homelessness as well as to support increased data collection and analysis.

EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take three months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, six months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2 percent) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percentage change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percentage changes are 90 percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percentage changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised 2 percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau's website (www.census.gov/construction/nrc/how_the_data_are_collected/).
* The 90 percent confidence interval includes zero. In such cases, there is insufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero.

07/21/2017:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2017/pr17-054.cfm,East Baltimore Redevelopment Earns 2017 HUD Secretary Award for Historic Preservation,"WASHINGTON - For years, dozens of historic rowhouses in an East Baltimore neighborhood sat vacant, boarded up and crumbling from neglect while nearby families were in need of affordable housing. Then, a $9.3 million redevelopment project rehabilitated 32 vacant rowhouses into beautiful affordable housing homes complete with a coffee shop and a workforce development center inside two mixed-use buildings.
Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation announced that the project, the East Baltimore Historic II, is the winner of the prestigious 2017 ACHP/HUD Secretary's Award for Excellence in Historic Preservation (https://www.huduser.gov/portal/about/HistoricPres-2017.html).
The award recognizes the project's success in advancing the goals of historic preservation, while providing affordable housing and expanded economic opportunities for low-and moderate-income families and residents. The result is two blocks of rehabilitated homes that still retain the character of the city's historic district.
""This is a great example of the power that comes from a public-private collaboration, not just to rehab a few homes, but an entire neighborhood,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""This project serves as a model of how to rebuild our aging infrastructure in cities, and I'm proud to partner with the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation to recognize the East Baltimore Historic II project. It's not only honoring the historic character of Charm City, but also offering new economic opportunities to families.""
""East Baltimore Historic II exemplifies the ACHP's recommendations for best practices in community revitalization,"" said ACHP Chairman Milford Wayne Donaldson. ""With this project, historic tax credits were used to promote the principles of smart growth and sustainability, while at the same time preserving local historic assets.""
TRF Development Partners' renovation of the East Baltimore Historic II community combines historic preservation, community development, and affordable housing within a stressed and disinvested housing market. From late 2014 through early 2016, the TRF fully rehabilitated the 32 vacant rowhouses and two mixed-use buildings on two city blocks. The housing units are income restricted and affordable to people earning 50 to 80 percent of the Area Median Income. The project was also designed to meet the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Treatment of Historic Propertiesand transformed an entire neighborhood block, spurring additional rehabilitation activity nearby.
The project emerged from a larger redevelopment plan for East Baltimore between TRF and BUILD, a community partner that includes more than 20,000 residents. Their joint plan came after two planning processes, begun in 2004, in partnership with the city of Baltimore. The plan called for homeownership and rental redevelopment production to achieve the quickest possible sustainable re-occupancy of long-vacant units in the Broadway East and Oliver neighborhoods of Baltimore, with minimum use of public subsidy.
HUD funding allowed TRF to provide the neighborhood and its residents with a neighborhood coffee shop. CUPs Coffeehouse and Café is a nonprofit coffee shop that provides a workforce development program for at-risk teens and young adults. The availability of HUD grant funds allowed the retail space to achieve a basic commercial buildout without carrying any permanent debt, allowing TRF to offer the space at a low rent to support the nonprofit business. HUD funding therefore enabled the creation of two services offered for the community at the coffee shop: a workforce development program and a retail business serving breakfast and lunch six days a week.
The East Baltimore Historic II project was also developed so as to make use of the Federal Historic Tax Credit, and therefore the design and scope of work for all properties were submitted to the State Historic Preservation Office and National Park Service for review. Each rehabilitation was thoroughly documented prior to the work, and each house retained the historic footprint and existing fenestration patterns; retained or carefully replicated existing historic features; and, where appropriate, alterations were approved. The result is that the two blocks of renovated homes still retain the character of the historic district."

The grants announced today are provided through HUD's Community Development Block Grant - Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) Program. Combined with CDBG-DR grants already allocated, HUD's investment to these areas totals nearly $947 million.
""Clearly, there are hard-hit communities in these states that need more help to recover from the devastating floods they experienced over the past two years,"" said Secretary Carson. ""Today, we make another investment in the future of these communities and to help our neighbors in need.""
CDBG-Disaster Recovery grants support a wide variety of activities including housing redevelopment, business assistance and infrastructure repair. State and local governments in West Virginia, Texas, North Carolina, South Carolina and Florida will target these grants in ""the most impacted"" areas. CDBG-DR allocations are based upon a statutory formula that measures the unmet costs to repair seriously damaged properties and infrastructure in the counties determined to be most impacted.

HUD is releasing the following disaster recovery funds:
Background
On May 5th, President Trump signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2017, which included $400 million to support recovery from major disasters in 2015 and later. To determine these disaster recovery allocations, the Act requires HUD to analyze the most currently available data of the unmet costs to repair seriously damaged properties and infrastructure in the most-impacted counties. To date, HUD provided $343 million in disaster recovery under this Appropriations Act, which directs HUD to allocate the remaining funds ($57 million) at a future date to areas that experience disasters meeting the 'most impacted' threshold HUD announced last January.
Following major disasters in 2015 and 2016, Congress, through four supplemental spending measures (including the Act described above), appropriated a combined $3 billion through CDBG-DR. The State of Louisiana is the largest single grantee, receiving a total of $1.7 billion in recovery funds to address the long-term recovery following last year's flooding in Baton Rouge and surrounding parishes. Read HUD's news release for details of these prior allocations."

08/08/2017:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2017/pr17-060.cfm,HUD Approves Discrimination Agreement Between California Fair Housing Group and Marin County Landlords,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced an agreement between a Northern California fair housing organization and the owners and managers of two apartment complexes in Greenbrae, California. The agreement resolves allegations the owners and their agents discriminated against a female tenant with disabilities who requires an assistance animal. Read the Conciliation Agreement.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from denying or limiting housing opportunities to persons with disabilities or imposing different rental terms and conditions. This includes refusing to make reasonable accommodations in policies or practices for people with disabilities.
""Landlords are required to provide a reasonable accommodation for individuals who require assistance animals,"" said Bryan Greene, HUD General Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD is committed to make certain that landlords meet this obligation under the nation's fair housing laws.""
The case came to HUD's attention when the group Fair Housing Advocates of Northern California filed a complaint alleging that the owner of the properties (Shultz Investment Co.), representatives of its management company (Greenbrae Management, Inc.) and its leasing agents discriminated against a resident who has a medical condition and requires a service dog. The animal alerts her when she is experiencing physiological changes and helps to ameliorate many of her disability-related symptoms.
The fair housing group also claimed the woman, who had lived at the property for more than 15 years, was subjected to discriminatory statements and retaliation due to the presence of her assistance animal, including false accusations that the animal was disruptive, that it bit maintenance workers, and that it was not a service animal under California law. The woman's Housing Assistance Program voucher was ultimately cancelled, forcing her to find housing elsewhere.
A subsequent HUD investigation corroborated the woman's need for the dog and discovered written discriminatory statements made by the property managers. HUD found no evidence indicating that the animal was disruptive or had bitten anyone.
Under the Conciliation Agreement, the respondents will pay the woman $31,000; pay Fair Housing Advocates of Northern California $41,000; and develop and implement a reasonable accommodation and reasonable modification policy consistent with the Fair Housing Act. The owners will also revise their standard lease to be consistent with the new accommodations policy; send a letter to current tenants notifying them of the new policy; and obtain fair housing training.
In addition to the Fair Housing Act's prohibition against discrimination based on disability, HUD provided guidance in April 2013 reaffirming that housing providers must provide reasonable accommodations to people with disabilities who require assistance animals. Read HUD's notice.
Disability is the most common basis of fair housing complaint filed with HUD and its partner agencies. Last year alone, HUD and its partners considered over 4,900 disability-related complaints, or more than 58 percent of all fair housing complaints that were filed.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to www.hud.gov/fairhousing, or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple and Android devices."
08/09/2017:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2017/pr17-061.cfm,HUD Reports 'Worst Case Housing Needs' Increased in 2015,"WASHINGTON - The number of very poor unsubsidized families struggling to pay their monthly rent and who may also be living in substandard housing increased between 2013 and 2015, according to a new report released today by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. HUD reports that in 2015, 8.3 million very low-income unassisted families paid more than half their monthly income for rent, lived in severely substandard housing, or both. Read HUD's latest estimate of Worst Case Housing Needs (https://www.huduser.gov/portal/publications/Worst-Case-Housing-Needs.html).
""Two years ago, our nation was still feeling the aftershocks of our housing recession with rents growing faster than many families' incomes,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""After years of trying to keep up with rising rents, it's time we take a more holistic look at how government at every level, working with the private market and others, can ease the pressure being felt by too many un-assisted renters. Today's affordable rental housing crisis requires that we take a more business-like approach on how the public sector can reduce the regulatory barriers so the private markets can produce more housing for more families.""
Demand for affordable housing is growing faster than the construction of homes working families can afford to rent, especially in high-cost areas of the country. The Trump Administration is seeking to stimulate the production and preservation of affordable housing in a number of ways. By pursuing housing finance reform, the Administration seeks to unwind the Federal government's role in the private mortgage market and ease the stress on rental markets.
Worst Case Housing Needs are defined as renters with very low incomes (below half the median in their area) who do not receive government housing assistance and who either paid more than half their monthly incomes for rent, lived in severely substandard conditions, or both. HUD's report finds that housing needs cut across all regions of the country and include all racial and ethnic groups, regardless of whether they live in cities, suburbs or rural areas. In addition, HUD concluded that large numbers of worst case needs were also found across various household types including families with children, senior citizens, and persons with disabilities.
HUD's estimate is part of a long-term series of reports measuring the scale of critical housing problems facing very low-income un-assisted renters. Based on data from the 2015 American Housing Survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau, the number of these ""Worst Case Housing Needs"" increased from 2013 yet remain lower than the nearly 8.5 million households reported in 2011. For the first time, HUD is reporting estimates of Worst Case Housing Needs for select metropolitan areas across the country (see below).
HUD's report found:
After a decline in Worst Case Needs from 2011 to 2013, the number of these very poor unsubsidized renter households increased between 2013 and 2015 to the second highest number of households recorded - 8.3 million.
• After a decline in Worst Case Needs from 2011 to 2013, the number of these very poor unsubsidized renter households increased between 2013 and 2015 to the second highest number of households recorded - 8.3 million.

The number of households with worst case needs have increased by 66 percent since 2001, with historic increases occurring between 2007 and 2011 when the combination of mortgage foreclosures, widespread unemployment, and shrinking renter incomes dramatically expanded severe housing problems. While incomes continued to rise between 2013 and 2015, rents also increased nearly as fast. For the poorest renters, however, growth in rental costs outpaced income gains. Though the production of rental housing is strong, the rapidly growing renter population is putting increasing pressure on the rental market, particularly on the inventory of affordable rental housing. The number of households with worst case needs increased across all racial and ethnic groups. The prevalence of worst case needs during 2015 was 47 percent for Hispanic renters, 45 percent for non-Hispanic White renters, 37 percent for non-Hispanic Black renters, and 41 percent for others. Regionally, the South and West were home to most very low-income renters. These renters also had the highest prevalence of worst case needs and the lowest likelihood of receiving housing assistance. By metropolitan type, worst case needs were most prevalent in densely populated urban suburbs, followed by central cities.

Worst Case Needs at the Local Level
For the first time, HUD is reporting estimates of Worst Case Housing Needs for select metropolitan areas across the country. For the largest 15 metropolitan areas, HUD will measure these needs every two years*. The remaining 10 metropolitan areas represent a subset of the 16th to 50th largest metropolitan areas that will be surveyed on a rotating basis every 4 years++."

EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take three months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, six months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2 percent) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percentage change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percentage changes are 90 percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percentage changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised 3 percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau's website (https://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/how_the_data_are_collected/index.html).
* The 90 percent confidence interval includes zero. In such cases, there is insufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero."
08/21/2017:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2017/pr17-064.cfm,"HUD Awards $500,000 Main Street Grant to Monticello, New York","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that Monticello, New York in Sullivan County will receive a $500,000 grant to rehabilitate the Strong Building at 430 Broadway and build affordable housing units for low-income residents. The grant is funded through HUD's HOPE VI Main Street Program.
HUD's Main Street Program seeks to rejuvenate older, downtown business districts in smaller communities while retaining the area's traditional and historic character by providing grants for the development of affordable housing in existing, obsolete buildings. Smaller communities must have an ongoing Main Street revitalization effort in order to be eligible for these grants.
""Main Street is the heart and soul of so many communities across our nation,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""HUD is proud to support this public-private venture and breathe new life into a building that may have otherwise become forgotten history.""
The award will assist in the rehabilitation of the Strong Building, a prominent three-story brick building that anchors a major intersection in the Village of Monticello's business district. One of the village's largest buildings with nearly 20,000 square feet of commercial floor space, the Strong Building has been vacant for the past 10 years and currently has extensive interior water damage. An architectural assessment found that the exterior walls and foundation are sound, but demolition of the interior and replacement of the roof are necessary to retain its historic charm. The Main Street grant will provide financing for these activities and contribute to the reconfiguration of the building into 16 affordable housing units. The total development cost is estimated to be $1.2 million.
While rehabilitating possibly dangerous vacant property, these grants may be used to install, repair, or replace capital needs items including, but not limited to, security systems/surveillance cameras, fencing, lighting systems, emergency alarm systems, window bars, deadbolt locks and doors."

09/05/2017:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2017/pr17-070.cfm,HUD Report Finds People Living with Mental Disabilities Face Significant Rental Housing Discrimination,"WASHINGTON - Persons living with mental illness, intellectual or other developmental disabilities continue to face significant housing discrimination in the rental housing market, according to a new pilot study released today by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).
Rental Housing Discrimination on the Basis of Mental Disabilities: Results of Pilot Testing (https://www.huduser.gov/portal/sites/default/files/pdf/MentalDisabilities-FinalPaper.pdf) finds that when compared to people without mental disabilities, those persons who are living with mental disabilities receive fewer responses to their rental inquiries, are informed of fewer available units, and are less likely to be invited to contact the housing provider. In addition, HUD's study found that they are less likely to be invited to tour an available unit, are more likely to be steered to a different unit than the one advertised, and are treated differently depending on their type of disability.
The study also examined what happens when a person with a mental disability makes a request for a reasonable accommodation, finding that a large percentage of people with mental disabilities were given a negative response to their requests, ranging from outright denials to subtler barriers.
""Today's study spotlights the types of discrimination people with mental disabilities experience when searching for housing,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""The findings will not only inform our enforcement efforts, but enable us to identify and remove barriers for those who face housing discrimination. Though nearly 30 years have passed since the Fair Housing Act was expanded to protect individuals with disabilities, we still have work to do to ensure equitable housing opportunities for all.""
The study has significant importance for the future of paired testing for housing discrimination because it represents the first multicity housing discrimination study to utilize people with mental disabilities as testers. Research focused on two areas: the prevalence and kinds of discrimination facing people with mental disabilities seeking rental housing in the private market, and effective methodologies for testing for housing discrimination using people with mental disabilities as testers.
As a pilot study, it was conducted through e-mail and phone testing in nine small and mid-sized urban rental markets that mirror the distribution of the mental and developmental disability population across metropolitan statistical areas in the U.S., and with in-person testing in the two large rental markets, Chicago and Washington, DC. Testing was divided equally between mental illness and intellectual developmental disabilities, and a total of more than 1,000 matched pair tests (i.e. pairing and comparing testers with mental disabilities with testers who have no mental disabilities, known as control testers) were administered.
The pilot study revealed that individuals with mental disabilities seeking rental housing were:
Less likely to receive a response to their inquiry in e-mail testing (17.55 percent of people without disabilities received a response compared with 9.19 percent of people with mental illness and intellectual or developmental disability in email testing); Less likely to be told an advertised unit was available in in-person testing (5.94 percent of people without disabilities were told that the advertised unit was available compared with 0.99 percent of people with mental illness and intellectual or developmental disabilities in in-person testing); Less likely to be invited to contact the housing provider in e-mail testing (7.69 percent of people without disabilities were invited to contact the housing provider to see the unit compared with 0.00 percent of people with mental illness and intellectual or developmental disabilities in e-mail testing); Less likely to be invited to inspect the available unit in telephone testing (21.26 percent of people without disabilities were invited to inspect the unit compared with 16.47 percent of people with mental illness and intellectual or developmental disabilities in telephone testing); More likely to be encouraged to look at a different unit than the one advertised in telephone testing, a potential indicator of steering people with mental illness and intellectual or developmental disabilitiestoward specific buildings or areas within rental complexes; and Treated adversely at disparate rates depending on disability type, with higher rates of adverse treatment found for individuals with mental illness than for those with intellectual or developmental disabilities.
• Less likely to receive a response to their inquiry in e-mail testing (17.55 percent of people without disabilities received a response compared with 9.19 percent of people with mental illness and intellectual or developmental disability in email testing);
• Less likely to be told an advertised unit was available in in-person testing (5.94 percent of people without disabilities were told that the advertised unit was available compared with 0.99 percent of people with mental illness and intellectual or developmental disabilities in in-person testing);
• Less likely to be invited to contact the housing provider in e-mail testing (7.69 percent of people without disabilities were invited to contact the housing provider to see the unit compared with 0.00 percent of people with mental illness and intellectual or developmental disabilities in e-mail testing);
• Less likely to be invited to inspect the available unit in telephone testing (21.26 percent of people without disabilities were invited to inspect the unit compared with 16.47 percent of people with mental illness and intellectual or developmental disabilities in telephone testing);
• More likely to be encouraged to look at a different unit than the one advertised in telephone testing, a potential indicator of steering people with mental illness and intellectual or developmental disabilitiestoward specific buildings or areas within rental complexes; and
• Treated adversely at disparate rates depending on disability type, with higher rates of adverse treatment found for individuals with mental illness than for those with intellectual or developmental disabilities.
Additionally, the willingness of a housing provider to grant a request for an accommodation varied by mode of testing, with the rate of granting a request for a reasonable accommodation being significantly higher when the request was made by telephone compared to email. However, regardless of the testing mode, a significant percentage of people with mental disability seeking reasonable accommodation were given a negative response to their request. Moreover, when requests were made by phone, response rates differed by type of disability, revealing that a higher percentage of housing providers were willing to provide accommodations to people with intellectual or developmental disabilities (63.8 percent) than to people with mental illness (55.2 percent).
These results suggest that a broad-based initiative to educate housing providers about their fair housing rights and obligations could be helpful. The study also suggests that housing, disability, and civil rights organizations should increase their efforts to educate persons with mental disabilities about their housing rights, how to recognize discrimination, and what actions they should take when facing possible discrimination.
HUD is also publishing four supplemental short papers that complement and further illustrate the complex issues surrounding both housing discrimination against people with mental disabilities and the involvement of people with mental disabilities in testing for housing discrimination.

09/05/2017:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2017/pr17-071.cfm,Survivor Housing a Priority for the Federal and State Recovery Effort after Hurricane Harvey,"WASHINGTON - The federal government continues to focus on the lives and safety of those affected by Hurricane Harvey. While the coordinated response continues, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and other federal, state, local, and tribal partners, are beginning to direct efforts toward recovery, including housing survivors displaced by the disaster through the state-led disaster housing task force.
HUD is the lead federal coordinating agency for long-term disaster-related housing needs resulting from Hurricane Harvey. Federal partners are working closely with the Texas state-led housing task force, as well as other state, local, tribal and voluntary agencies, to meet the need for quality affordable rental homes. They're also focused on identifying strategies to strengthen the housing market, building inclusive and sustainable communities, and integrating disaster mitigation measures into community design and development, to reduce future damages.
HUD is primarily supported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Department of Justice, FEMA and other federal departments, agencies and national organizations. Below is a summary of the short-term, intermediate and long-term efforts already underway:
Short-term Housing Activities
For those who are eligible for FEMA assistance, FEMA transitional housing assistance provides lodging to displaced survivors who need a place immediately. FEMA pays the hotel/motel directly for this assistance. Local communities, the American Red Cross, and other voluntary and faith-based agencies are providing emergency shelter to those displaced by the storm and subsequent flooding. AmeriCorps and other voluntary and faith-based organizations are helping to clean out flood-damage to homes. HUD is immediately assisting those displaced from public housing and multifamily subsidized rental units. Immediate foreclosure relief may also be available for Texas residents. HUD is granting a 90-day moratorium on foreclosures and forbearance on foreclosures of Federal Housing Administration (FHA)-insured home mortgages.

Intermediate and Long-Term Housing Activities
HUD's giving communities in Presidentially-declared disaster areas, the flexibility to redirect millions of dollars in annual CDBG and HOME formula funding to address critical needs, including housing and services for disaster survivors. In addition, HUD is:
Making mortgage insurance available: HUD provides FHA insurance to disaster victims who have lost their homes and are facing the daunting task of rebuilding or buying another home. Borrowers from participating FHA-approved lenders may be eligible for 100 percent financing; Making insurance available for both mortgages and home rehabilitation: HUD's Section 203(k) loan program enables those who have lost their homes to finance the purchase or refinance of a house along with its repair through a single mortgage. It also allows homeowners who have damaged houses to finance the rehabilitation of their existing single-family home; and Offering Section 108 loan guarantee assistance: HUD will offer state and local governments federally guaranteed loans for housing rehabilitation, economic development and repair of public infrastructure. FEMA's Individuals and Households Program provides financial assistance in the form of grants to survivors with uninsured or under-insured flood related losses. To-date, more than 176,000 individuals and households have been approved for more than $141 million in assistance. Of that amount, $50 million is approved for housing assistance, such as rental assistance. Survivors may use the rental assistance to obtain temporary housing such as a house, apartment, hotel, motel, or other readily-available dwelling for rent by the public. As part of FEMA's comprehensive approach to meet the post-disaster intermediate housing needs caused by Hurricane Harvey, FEMA is considering all available housing options for survivors. FEMA is working with federal, state and local partners to assess the temporary housing needs and the best options to meet those needs. The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) provides low-interest loans to cover residential losses not fully compensated by insurance. Loans are available up to $200,000 for primary residence; $40,000 for personal property, including renter losses. As of September 1, 2017, the SBA has received 2,118 disaster loan applications, primarily for homes. The SBA has fielded 5,221 calls and completed 451 property damage inspections. Insurance proceeds help insured homeowners and renters to repair hurricane-damaged, or flood-damaged property more quickly. The National Flood Insurance Program is authorizing advance payments of certain NFIP claims to expedite recovery. Call your insurance agent to find out more or to file a flood insurance claim under the NFIP.

09/14/2017:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2017/pr17-074.cfm,HUD Awards $56 Million for Housing and Community Development Projects in 80 Native American Communities,"WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) awarded $56 million to 80 Native American tribes throughout the country to improve housing conditions and to stimulate economic development in their communities. HUD's Indian Community Development Block Grant (ICDBG) Program is a competitive program that supports a wide range of community development and affordable housing activities, from new housing for individual families to community amenities like rec centers or water lines.
""These grants will support our Native American communities as they work to improve housing conditions and neighborhoods,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""HUD will continue to be a steadfast partner to tribes as they design and execute their community development plans.""
With a deep need for more affordable housing in tribal communities, most of this year's project winners will use their ICDBG funds to build homes or to rehabilitate dilapidated housing, in order to alleviate homelessness, relieve overcrowding, and avoid members having to leave their community - spurring jobs and economic development along the way.
Many tribes will also use the funds for other community needs. For example, the Karuk Tribe in California will use its award to build a new 4,400-square-foot Workforce Development and Training Center. In Maine, the Penobscot Tribe will build 24 new senior rental housing units that are energy efficient in an apartment-type setting in order to help the unmet need for affordable senior housing. In Texas, the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe will improve the public water quality and pipeline-carrying capacity for more 89 homes and 12 nonresidential buildings on the east side of the Alabama-Coushatta Reservation.
The ICDBG program was established in 1977 to help Indian tribes and Alaska Native villages meet their community development needs, including decent housing, healthy living environments, and economic opportunities. Federally recognized Indian tribes, bands, groups or nations (including Alaska Indian, Aleuts and Eskimos,) Alaska Native villages, and eligible tribal organizations can compete for this funding. The grant awardees can use the funding to build new housing, fix existing housing, buy land for housing; or for infrastructure projects including roads, water and sewer projects; and to spur economic development including jobs.
HUD administers six programs that are specifically targeted to American Indian, Alaska Native, or Native Hawaiian individuals and families, and federally recognized tribal governments. Through the Native American Housing Assistance and Self Determination Act (NAHASDA), HUD will provide more than $730 million to fund programs to support housing and development initiatives in American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian communities. Through innovative programming, American Indian and Alaska Native tribal governments have championed sustainable and community-driven solutions to their housing and community development challenges."
09/14/2017:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2017/pr17-075.cfm,Senate Confirms Pamela Patenaudea as HUD's Deputy Secretary,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Senate today confirmed President Trump's nomination of Pamela Patenaude to serve as Deputy Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). HUD Secretary Ben Carson welcomed the Senate's action and said it comes at a critical time as the Department prepares to support the long-term recovery following Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.
""At this moment when so many of our citizens are suffering, Pam will bring strong leadership when we need her most,"" said Secretary Carson. ""Pam's extensive housing and community development experience will be invaluable as we embark upon the long road to recovery for communities hard-hit by disaster and I'm grateful the Senate confirmed her nomination.""
As Deputy Secretary, Ms. Patenaude will lead the Department's Disaster Management Group (DMG) and will play a primary leadership and operational role in coordinating the long-term recovery efforts of 16 program and support offices within HUD, including the Offices of Public and Indian Housing, Community Planning and Development, Policy Development and Research, and Housing / Federal Housing Administration (FHA). To facilitate post-disaster recovery of damaged homes, businesses and critical infrastructure, Congress appropriated $7.4 billion in funding for HUD's Community Development Block Grant - Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) Program.
Ms. Patenaude is uniquely qualified to contribute to these efforts immediately, as she previously served as HUD's Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development and provided leadership for the long-term recovery efforts necessitated by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Ms. Patenaude's nomination was reported favorably by a bipartisan voice vote of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs on June 14th, three months ago."

Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2 percent) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percentage change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percentage changes are 90 percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percentage changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised 3 percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau's website (https://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/how_the_data_are_collected/index.html).
* The 90 percent confidence interval includes zero. In such cases, there is insufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero."
09/21/2017:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2017/pr17-079.cfm,HUD Returns East St. Louis Housing Authority to Local Control,"EAST ST. LOUIS, IL - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson today announced that HUD is returning the East St. Louis Housing Authority (ESLHA) to local control after more than 30 years of federal receivership. Secretary Carson traveled to East St. Louis today to make the formal announcement along with Mayor Emeka Jackson-Hicks.
HUD took over operational control of the ESLHA on October 28, 1985, following years of deteriorating physical conditions, financial mismanagement and a lack of effective leadership. Today's announcement formally ends the first and longest federal receivership of a local public housing authority. Under the terms of the Transition Agreement, the Mayor will appoint a five-member Board of Commissioners and HUD will transfer ESLHA's assets, programs and projects to local control. The Board will work with the housing authority's Executive Director Mildred Motley to oversee management of more than 2,000 public housing units as the local agency works to improve continuing physical and financial challenges.
""This has been an extremely long road but we now feel confident there the necessary capacity in place to turn the keys back over to our local partners,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""Running a housing authority isn't easy, but it requires the very best of those who manage public housing because the folks who call these units home deserve nothing less.""
East St. Louis Mayor Emeka Jackson-Hicks said, ""Today marks a significant milestone for residents and the ongoing revitalization efforts in East St. Louis. Over the past year-and-a-half, HUD, the ESLHA, members of the Advisory Board and I have developed a great working relationship to transition the housing authority back to local control. I am thankful to these individuals for playing an intricate role in helping ESLHA re-establish a new governance structure for accountability and transparency. We will continue to nurture our relationship with HUD and other public and private partners as East St. Louis reaches new heights. I am very appreciative of the outstanding residents who agreed to serve as ESLHA Board members and the city council's strong support of the new board.""
HUD believes the City, ESLHA and the agency's Board of Commissioners can responsibly assume control of the agency's 2,033 public housing units. Meanwhile, HUD will work with the Board of Commissioners to execute a two-year Enhanced Oversight Plan. As part of that agreement, HUD will designate an Oversight Administrator and a team of specialists to continue to provide support, manage HUD-provided technical assistance, and monitor ESLHA's performance in addressing ongoing and long-term challenges, including:
Development of a long-term strategy to address the rehabilitation and/or replacement of aging developments and chronically vacant units; Sustain operations within its means, build its reserves and maintain long-term financial health; Resolution of any audit recommendations and development of strategies to effectively administer its programs; and, Utilization of its Replacement Housing Factor grant to acquire and/or redevelopment new public housing units.

09/21/2017:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2017/pr17-081.cfm,HUD Awards $4 Million to East Chicago Housing Authority for Demolition of Lead-Surrounded Housing Complex,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has awarded the East Chicago Housing Authority (ECHA) in East Chicago, Indiana, $4 million for demolition of the West Calumet public housing complex. HUD has also finalized approval of the demolition plan by ECHA of the complex.
""Lead is a serious threat to the health and development of young children and can poison entire neighborhoods,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""This grant will allow leaders in East Chicago to move forward on a plan for a safer, healthier future.""
The Environmental Protection Agency added the United States Steel Lead site, where the West Calumet housing complex sits, to its National Priorities List in 2009. The site has been divided into three zones with Zone 1 encompassing the entire West Calumet housing complex. The EPA has been monitoring levels of lead and arsenic contamination in the soil there, and performing clean ups at properties while the site was designated a Superfund site.
On May 27, 2016, EPA reported high levels of lead in the soil in parts of the West Calumet Housing Complex to city officials, and approximately 1,100 residents at the complex were alerted of related health risks. Approximately 700 of the residents at the complex were children. Sampling of the soil at the complex came back at 1,200 parts per million and higher, though EPA's safe residential level of lead in soil is 400 parts per million. Signs were then posted across the complex warning parents to keep their children from playing in the dirt, and HUD expedited Housing Choice Vouchers to the East Chicago Housing Authority in order for them to move all families out of the complex. The last of the families residing at the complex moved out on June 16, 2017, and the complex now sits empty.
Generally, these emergency capital funds can be used for physical work items resulting from an unpreventable or unforeseen emergency that pose an immediate threat to life, health, or safety of residents, or property (including fire safety), and that must be corrected within one year of funding.
As a result of the developments at the West Calumet housing complex, HUD is classifying the demolition there as emergency work, due to the limited capital funding that is currently available to ECHA, and because it is an unpreventable emergency endangering the lives and safety of any children, the elderly and disabled residents at the site. It is vital for the health and safety of the community to quickly demolish the structures on the contaminated soil so the remediation plan can move forward, and to address the lead and arsenic contaminants still there."

10/03/2017:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2017/pr17-088.cfm,HUD Announces Agreement to Settle Discrimination Complaint Against State of Maryland,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced an agreement to resolve a discrimination complaint brought by fair housing advocates against Maryland's Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) challenging the fairness of the State's Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Program. The agreement establishes policies, incentives, and more flexible program rules that will streamline the creation of affordable housing in higher opportunity neighborhoods in the Baltimore region.
Specifically, the settlement will increase the number of affordable housing units in the region by as many as 1,500, with more than 1,000 of those units being new construction. In addition, developers of affordable housing will no longer have to satisfy previously required local scoring or approval criteria before applying for state-allocated tax credits. Read the Conciliation and Voluntary Compliance Agreement.
""Skyrocketing housing prices in the Baltimore region are making it harder than ever for hardworking families to find decent housing at prices they can afford,"" said Anna Maria Farías, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Today's agreement will help ensure that people of all backgrounds who call this area home have more affordable housing options in higher opportunity neighborhoods.""
The agreement announced today is the result of a complaint filed with HUD in 2011 by the Baltimore Regional Housing Campaign (BRHC), a coalition of housing and civil rights organizations. BRHC said the state maintained a policy requiring local jurisdictions to approve proposed affordable housing projects prior to the consideration or allocation of Low-Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC) to fund construction. The coalition's complaint alleged that requiring local jurisdiction pre-approval prevented the placement of LIHTC-funded properties in predominately White areas, thereby limiting housing opportunities for African American and Hispanic families in communities of opportunity.
Under the terms of the agreement, DHCD will:
Not reinstate the previously required local approvals of proposed affordable housing projects, or impose new threshold or scoring criteria that require the approval of a local governing body; Ensure that no fewer than 1,500 units of Family Housing are developed in communities of opportunity within the Baltimore region, 1,050 of which will be newly constructed units; Revise the state's Qualified Allocation Plans (QAP) Transit-Oriented Development Guide to award points to any proposal to develop family housing in a community of opportunity, and adjust the incentive in QAPs for units with two or more bedrooms; Expand its affirmative fair housing marketing plans with specific outreach to public housing authorities, voucher administrators and mobility counseling programs; and Pay $225,000 to sustain BRHC's mission of working to increase choice, educational opportunity and social equity for low-income families in the Baltimore region.

HUD is tasked with comprehensive, long-term disaster relief and has been working on the front lines in Texas. We are your ear on the ground and your voice in Washington, and we are committed to providing a compassionate and effective response.
Even before the hurricane hit, we had staff on the ground acting as an immediate source of information, support, and action. They are a human link between those in need and HUD resources.
Since the hurricane, I have been to Texas three times to survey the devastation and monitor our progress. Our team has been working closely with our fellow civil servants at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and other agencies, as well as our state and local partners, to coordinate our efforts and make sure we are fully responsive.
We are currently locating vacancies and moving displaced residents into safer housing. We are also working closely with homeless shelters and with temporary shelters, ensuring they have the resources they need. And we are working to place those in shelters into long-term or permanent housing.
We are also providing special relief through the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). HUD has already granted a 90-day moratorium on foreclosures for FHA-insured properties in disaster-affected areas. In addition, we offer loan forbearance and loan modifications for borrowers struggling to make payments in disaster-affected areas.
Additionally, we have made specific mortgage products available for those impacted by Hurricane Harvey. Some homeowners whose properties were destroyed or damaged may be eligible for 100 percent financing through HUD's Section 203(h) program. This will enable them to rebuild or buy another home. In addition, homeowners can use Section 203(k) FHA insurance to refinance an existing mortgage into a new mortgage that covers the cost of repairs.
You can learn more about these programs and services on HUD's website (https://www.hud.gov).
HUD is part of the recovery process, providing the information and commitment, now and in the years to come, that Americans expect and deserve. We look forward to supporting you on your journey to recovery."

The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from denying or limiting housing to people with disabilities, or from refusing to make reasonable accommodations in policies or practices for people with disabilities. Allowing people with disabilities to have assistance animals that perform work or tasks, or that provide disability-related emotional support, is considered a reasonable accommodation under the Act.
""Assistance animals play a vital role in helping our veterans cope with service-related disabilities,"" said Anna Maria Farías, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Housing providers have an obligation to permit these animals, and HUD ensures that they meet this obligation.""
The case came to HUD's attention when the veteran filed a complaint alleging that the owner and manager of Westview Park Apartments denied his request to keep an assistance animal, despite the veteran explaining in detail his right to have the animal. In a letter responding to the veteran's request, the owner suggested that he get a cat instead, citing the property's policy of allowing cats but not allowing assistance animals weighing more than 12 pounds. The owner also stated that, even for an animal under 12 pounds, the veteran would need to provide proof that the animal was licensed.
The veteran responded by providing a copy of his license for the animal, a certificate of training, and additional information about the animal, but the owner still refused his request, stating the dog had to be removed from the property. In a subsequent letter, the manager notified the veteran that he was in violation of his lease by having the dog and that he had two weeks to vacate the unit. The eviction action was later withdrawn, but the veteran, still not being allowed to keep the animal, moved out of the apartment at the end of his lease.
Disability is the most common basis of complaint filed with HUD and its partner agencies. Last year alone, HUD and its partners considered more than 4,500 disability-related complaints, nearly 55 percent of all fair housing complaints.
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party elects for the case to be heard in federal court. If the administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to the complainant for his loss as a result of the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties in order to vindicate the public interest.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to hud.gov/fairhousing, or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple and Android devices."
10/13/2017:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2017/pr17-091.cfm,HUD Charges Pennsylvania Landlords with Discrimination after Posting Online Anti-Family Classified Ad,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is charging the owners and operators of two apartment buildings in Altoona, Pennsylvania with violating the Fair Housing Act by posting online classified ads that discriminate against families with children. Read HUD's charge.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to discriminate against families with children and pregnant women, including unlawfully denying or limiting housing, making discriminatory statements, or imposing discriminatory rules or policies.
""No family should be denied the opportunity to rent a home simply because they have children,"" said Anna Maria Farías, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Today's enforcement action reaffirms HUD's commitment to make sure housing providers meet their obligations to treat all applicants fairly, regardless of whether they have kids or not.""
The case came to HUD's attention when the Fair Housing Partnership of Greater Pittsburgh, a local HUD-assisted fair housing organization, filed a complaint alleging that the owners and managers of the Altoona properties repeatedly violated the Fair Housing Act by running ads on Craigslist that discriminate against families with children. One ad for a two-bedroom unit read: ""Not suitable for children/pets.""
After the online ad was posted, the Fair Housing Partnership of Greater Pittsburgh conducted fair housing tests to determine if the landlords intended to reserve apartments at the property exclusively to people without children, as advertised. One tester, posing as a married man with a pregnant wife and a three-year-old son, was told by the owner that he would not show him the unit because it ""wouldn't work out for either of us."" A second tester, posing as a man with no children, was told by the owner that the unit would be available in a week. A third tester, posing as a married woman with a child, was told that having children was a problem because the unit is located above the leasing office and children would make noise and because there is no yard. Three additional tests also revealed the owner demonstrated a preference for renting to applicants who did not have children.
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party elects for the case to be heard in federal court. If the administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to the complainant for his or her loss as a result of the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties in order to vindicate the public interest.

EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take three months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, six months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2 percent) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percentage change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percentage changes are 90 percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percentage changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised 3 percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau's website (https://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/how_the_data_are_collected/index.html).
* The 90 percent confidence interval includes zero. In such cases, there is insufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero."

10/20/2017:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2017/pr17-093.cfm,HUD Allocates Additional $58 Million to Help Texas Recover from Hurricane Harvey,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson today allocated an additional $57.8 million to help Texas recover from Hurricane Harvey. The grant announced today is provided through HUD's Community Development Block Grant - Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) Program. Combined with CDBG-DR grants already allocated to the State of Texas from disasters that occurred in 2015 and 2016, HUD's support of long-term disaster recovery in the Lone Star State now totals more than $371 million.
""Clearly, the long-term needs in Texas far exceed this allocation so I anticipate this downpayment will be targeted to address damaged housing to help Texans move forward with their own recovery,"" said Secretary Carson. ""As we work to allocate additional funding in a fair and effective manner, states and communities can count on HUD to be a strong partner in efforts to recover from the hurricanes and other major disasters our nation experienced this year.""
HUD relied upon the best available data from FEMA to allocate the recovery funds announced today and evidence supports the immediate allocation of the $57.8 million. The Department opted to allocate the funds to Texas as it has an existing recovery plan, as a result of funds awarded for 2016 disasters, that can serve as a rapid launch platform for the use of these funds. As additional disaster data become available in the coming weeks for areas impacted by major disasters declared in 2017, HUD will use those data to allocate the $7.4 billion in disaster recovery grants appropriated in September in an equitable and consistent manner, based on a clear understanding of unmet needs.
CDBG-DR grants support a wide variety of activities including housing redevelopment, business assistance and infrastructure repair. State and local governments are required to spend these recovery funds in ""the most impacted"" areas. Using data available from FEMA as of October 2, 2017, HUD determined that Texas has unmet housing needs in excess of $57.8 million as a result of Hurricane Harvey. Using these data, HUD estimates thirteen counties in Texas have qualifying levels of unmet housing needs but the situation is most severe in Harris, Galveston and Jefferson counties.
Background
On May 5th, President Trump signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2017 (the Act), which included $400 million in CDBG-DR funding to support recovery from major disasters in 2015 and later. To determine these disaster recovery allocations, the Act requires HUD to analyze the most currently available data of the unmet costs to repair seriously damaged properties and infrastructure in the most-impacted counties. HUD had previously allocated $342 million to qualifying 2015 and 2016 disasters nationwide.
On September 8th, President Trump signed the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 and the Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements Act, 2017, which appropriated $7.4 billion in CDBG-DR funding for major disasters declared in calendar year 2017. As more data become available with respect to unmet needs arising from disasters such as Harvey, Irma, Maria and the California fires, HUD will announce the allocation of the $7.4 billion."

While HUD granted a number of individual waivers following disasters in the past, today's announcement represents one of the largest collections of regulatory and administrative waivers ever issued by the Department at one time.
""The recent storms are unprecedented so it makes sense that our response be unprecedented as well,"" said Neal Rackleff, Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development. ""We must be as flexible as we possibly can to help our state and local partners at a time they need our help the most.""
The regulatory and administrative relief announced today covers the following HUD programs: The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program, HOME Investment Partnerships (HOME) Program, Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) Program, and Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG) Program. To expedite the use of these funds, HUD's state and local partners can now access a waiver through a new simplified notification process. HUD's flexibilities include:
HUD is allowing for an abbreviated public comment requirement on changes to a grantee's community redevelopment plans. Upon notification, HUD will reduce the customary 30-day comment period to seven days. This temporary allowance balances the need to help local communities more quickly while continuing to provide reasonable notice and opportunity for citizens to comment on the proposed uses of funds. Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria destroyed communications networks, particularly in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Therefore, HUD is waiving the normal communication requirements and allowing these grantees to determine what constitutes reasonable notice and opportunity to comment. These hurricanes also caused extensive damage and destruction to the housing stock in certain impacted areas. To accelerate new housing construction, HUD is suspending normal rules to enable CDBG grantees to replace affordable housing units that were lost as a result of the hurricanes and flooding. HUD recognizes that affected citizens may require additional time and effort to execute their recovery plans. Consequently, HUD will suspend a cap limiting CDBG expenditures for public services to 15 percent. HUD will temporarily allow CDBG grantees to pay for additional support services for individuals and families affected by the hurricanes. Services could include, but not be limited to, the provision of food, emergency shelter, case management and related services to help residents in declared-disaster areas until long-term recovery resources become available.

11/15/2017:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2017/pr17-100.cfm,FHA Releases 2017 Annual Report to Congress,"WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) today released its 2017 Annual Report to Congress on the economic condition of the agency's Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMI Fund). FHA reports that at the end FY 2017, the MMI Fund had a total economic net worth of $25.6 billion and the Capital Ratio that remains above the statutory minimum for a third straight year.
The MMI Fund supports FHA's Single Family mortgage insurance programs, including all forward purchase and refinance transactions, as well as mortgages insured under the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) or reverse mortgage program originated since FY 2009. While the MMI Fund remains above its minimum capital level, both the economic net worth and the capital ratio of the MMI Fund declined from levels reported last year. The Fund's economic net worth fell $1.9 billion and the capital ratio declined from 2.35 to 2.09 percent from FY 2016.
""The fiscal health of FHA demands our constant attention and vigilance to ensure we can continue providing sustainable homeownership opportunities to working families without exposing taxpayers to excessive risk,"" said U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson. ""Our duty is clear-we must make certain FHA remains financially viable so future generations can build wealth and climb the economic ladder of success.""
This year's report reflects a transition toward providing more transparency, consistency, and accountability, supporting FHA's commitment to enhanced disclosure on the financial condition and sustainability of its Single Family mortgage insurance programs. For example, FHA is providing stand-alone capital ratios for its forward and reverse mortgage programs to better assess the impact of each on the MMI Fund. In addition, FHA is providing new data and analysis into the economic drivers impacting the performance of the MMI Fund, including stress-testing of the portfolio based on historical scenarios.
KEY HIGHLIGHTS FROM FHA'S 2017 ANNUAL REPORT

• The average borrower's credit score was 676 compared to 680 in FY 2016.
FHA's FY 2017 CAPITAL RESOURCES
FHA maintains resources to cover both future claims, as well as an additional statutorily-required capital cushion of 2.0 percent of all Insurance-in-Force (IFF). This 'Capital Ratio' is calculated by dividing the Fund's Economic Net Worth ($25.6 billion in FY 2017) by total IFF of approximately $1.23 trillion. As noted above, the FY 2017 Capital Ratio of the Fund is 2.09 percent, a slight decline from the end of FY 2016 when the Capital Ratio was 2.35 percent.

FHA believes that properly evaluating future policy decisions, such as adjustments to mortgage insurance premium rates and overall risk tolerance for the Single Family portfolio, requires assessing capital adequacy across a range of economic scenarios. This year's Annual Report includes new and refined stress tests of the FHA portfolio, providing insight on the MMI Fund's Capital Ratio under 100 historical economic scenarios, including highly stressful periods in the housing market.
This year's report includes new stand-alone estimates of the capital resources and capital ratios for insured forward and Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECMs). This new reporting more accurately reflects the combined contributions of each program for the first time since HECMs became part of the MMI Fund in FY 2009.
The 2017 Annual Report finds the fiscal condition of FHA's forward mortgage portfolio is materially better than the HECM portfolio. Excluding HECMs, FHA's FY 2017 forward mortgages have a capital ratio of 3.33 percent, well above what Congress requires. FHA's forward mortgages in FY 2017 have a positive economic net worth of $38.4 billion, contributing $4.2 billion to the Fund. By contrast, the 2017 HECM portfolio has a negative capital ratio of 19.84 percent and a negative economic net worth of $14.5 billion. FHA took several actions earlier this year to stabilize the HECM program, changes that will be reflected in next year's annual report.
FHA MORTGAGE INSURANCE PREMIUMS
Immediately upon taking office, the Trump Administration indefinitely suspended a scheduled reduction in FHA's annual forward mortgage insurance premiums as the agency assessed the economic impact on the MMI Fund. The 2017 Annual Report concludes that had this premium reduction taken effect in January, the MMI Fund's Capital Ratio would have fallen to 1.76 percent (below the statutory minimum) resulting from a net reduction in cash flows of $3.2 billion and an increase in IIF of $45 billion.
HECM HIGHLIGHTS
FHA's Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM), or reverse mortgage program, continues to serve eligible seniors, 62 years and older, with a financing option that can help them remain in their home and age in place. As previously noted, the HECM portfolio has been a substantial economic drain on the MMI Fund. To place this program on a more fiscally sustainable path, FHA recently implemented a set of changes to mortgage insurance premiums, Principal Limit Factors (PLFs) and certain servicing requirements beginning in FY 2018. The impact of these changes on new endorsements, and the ongoing performance of the currently outstanding HECM portfolio, will continue to be closely monitored and managed by FHA. The 2017 Annual Report finds:
HECM endorsements grew 13.1 percent since last year, with 55,291 new mortgages endorsed. The Maximum Claim Amount (MCA) of FY 2017 endorsements totaled $17.7 billion, a 20.3 percent increase over FY 2016.
• HECM endorsements grew 13.1 percent since last year, with 55,291 new mortgages endorsed. The Maximum Claim Amount (MCA) of FY 2017 endorsements totaled $17.7 billion, a 20.3 percent increase over FY 2016.
HECM claims continued to increase in FY 2017, rising to $5.0 billion, up from the $4.2 billion in claims paid in FY 2016. As a result, HECM's net cash flow was negative 5.07 percent of HECM average Insurance-in-Force during FY 2017.
• HECM claims continued to increase in FY 2017, rising to $5.0 billion, up from the $4.2 billion in claims paid in FY 2016. As a result, HECM's net cash flow was negative 5.07 percent of HECM average Insurance-in-Force during FY 2017.
NEW INDEPENDENT ACTUARY
Pinnacle Actuarial Resources, Inc. (Pinnacle) served as the independent actuary for FY 2017. By serving as a critical check on the results, an independent actuarial review remains an integral part of the Annual Report process. Pinnacle's independent actuarial review reports for forward mortgages and HECM, confirming that the estimates used in the FY 2017 Annual Report to calculate the capital ratio are reasonable, are contained in the Annual Report."
11/16/2017:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2017/pr17-101.cfm,HUD Charges Kansas Property Owners with Housing Discrimination after Alleged Sexual Harassment of Two Female Tenants,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today it is charging the owner and landlord of several rental properties in Wichita, Kansas, and his wife, who co-owned one of the properties, with housing discrimination after the landlord allegedly sexually harassed two female tenants at his properties. HUD's charge further alleges that he also made discriminatory statements based on one of the women's race. Read HUD's charge here.
The Fair Housing Act makes it illegal to discriminate against individuals on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, familial status, or disability. Sexual harassment is a form of illegal sex discrimination.
""Landlords who use their position to intimidate or harass residents or to attempt to trade sexual favors for rent violate the sanctity of a woman's home, the place where she should feel the safest,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD is committed to protecting the housing rights of those who are sexually harassed and will continue to take action any time housing providers violate those rights.""
The charge is the result of complaints filed by two female residents alleging that the landlord made unwanted sexual advances toward them, harassed them, made derogatory statements based on race, and evicted them because they refused his advances.
HUD's charge alleges that the landlord subjected one of the women, who was working as a property manager, to a hostile environment, including entering her apartment uninvited, sexually harassing her, and requesting sex in exchange for allowing her to stay in her unit. The charge also alleges that the landlord told her that he could be her ""sugar daddy,"" grabbed her buttocks, and made comments about her body to others. On one occasion she awoke to find him in her bedroom on her bed.
The charge further alleges that the landlord subjected a second woman to a hostile environment by making numerous requests for sex when he picked up her rent payments. Once, when she was late paying a portion of her rent, the landlord allegedly asked her if she wanted to have sex with him instead of paying the $150 she owed. When she refused the offer, the landlord allegedly became very upset and immediately wrote her a 3-day notice to vacate.
The charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party elects for the case to be heard in federal court. If the administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to the complainants for their loss as a result of the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties in order to vindicate the public interest.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to hud.gov/fairhousing, or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple and Android devices."
11/17/2017:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2017/pr17-102.cfm,HUD Provides $5 Billion to Help Texas Recover from Hurricane Harvey,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today awarded $5.024 billion to help hard-hit areas in the State of Texas to recover from Hurricane Harvey. The grant announced today by the Trump Administration is provided through HUD's Community Development Block Grant - Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) Program and will support the repair of damaged homes, businesses and critical infrastructure in the State. HUD Deputy Secretary Pamela Hughes Patenaude and Governor Greg Abbott made the announcement today during a news conference in Austin.
""As President Trump has said from the beginning, the whole federal family is with the people of Texas to help them recover from this devastating storm as quickly as possible,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""HUD will work with Governor Abbott and his staff to do whatever is needed to rebuild damaged homes and to restore shuttered businesses in some of the hardest-hit areas of the State.""
Governor Abbott added, ""The urgency with which our federal partners are addressing the needs of Texans following Harvey is exactly what is needed to help them rebuild their lives. I thank Secretary Carson, Deputy Secretary Patenaude, and the Trump Administration for working on behalf of Texans who have been hardest hit and in need of immediate aid. Our goal from the start has been work in conjunction with federal and local leaders to help Texans repair and rebuild as quickly as possible, and this funding is a good start that brings us one step closer to achieving that goal.""
""Texans hit hardest by Hurricane Harvey face unprecedented hurdles as they rebuild their homes and businesses, and these funds will help them move forward after the storm,"" said Sen. John Cornyn. ""I'm grateful for the support Texas has received from Secretary Carson, and I look forward to continuing my work with Senator Cruz, the Texas delegation, and Governor Abbott to ensure Texans aren't left behind.""
On September 8th, President Trump signed the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 and the Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements Act, 2017 (https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/601/text). The Act appropriated $7.4 billion in CDBG-DR funding for major disasters declared in calendar year 2017. To distribute these funds, the Act requires HUD to direct the funds to the areas most impacted by qualifying disasters. HUD will announce additional grants to other jurisdictions as more data become available on the unmet needs from other disasters such Hurricane Irma, Hurricane Maria and the California fires.
In making today's allocation to the State of Texas, HUD relied upon information from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Small Business Administration (SBA) on the number of seriously damaged homes lacking adequate insurance and businesses that failed to qualify for SBA's disaster loan program. HUD's analysis found over 230,000 homes with damage, approximately 65,000 of which had serious damage that is not covered by other sources. More than 4,000 businesses similarly suffered serious damage from flooding that is not covered by insurance or other resources. The grant announced today is designed to meet needs not being met by private insurance or other sources of Federal assistance.
CDBG-DR grants support a wide variety of activities including housing redevelopment, business assistance and infrastructure repair. State and local governments are required to spend the majority of these recovery funds in ""most impacted"" areas as identified by HUD. The CDBG-DR initiative is built upon the basic CDBG program, and HUD will shortly issue administrative guidelines for use of the funds that will increase grantees' flexibility in addressing their long-term recovery needs."

EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take three months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, six months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2 percent) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percentage change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percentage changes are 90 percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percentage changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised 3 percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau's website (https://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/how_the_data_are_collected/index.html).
* The 90 percent confidence interval includes zero. In such cases, there is insufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero."

11/28/2017:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2017/pr17-105.cfm,HUD Files Fraud Complaint Against Former Top Officials of Alexander County Housing Authority,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced the agency has filed a fraud complaint against two former officials of the Alexander County (Illinois) Housing Authority (ACHA) for using public housing funds for personal travel and gifts and submitting false documentation to the Federal government. Read HUD's complaint.
Filed under the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act of 1986 (PFCRA), HUD's complaint alleges former ACHA Executive Director James Wilson and former ACHA Finance Director and Executive Director Martha Franklin ""knowingly overstated their travel expenses,"" sometimes double-charging ACHA for unreasonable and unsubstantiated travel expenses, including hotel stays in Las Vegas, personal meals and alcohol, and gifts to housing authority staff. The complaint also accuses James Wilson of filing false statements regarding the ACHA's compliance with civil rights laws and lead-based paint regulations.
HUD is seeking 125 civil penalties against Wilson and Franklin totaling $720,000 and another $188,000 in assessments based upon false claims the two made with respect to funds provided by HUD.
""Every dollar misspent on personal travel and other expenses is a dollar that could support the individuals and families we serve,"" said Dane Narode, Associate General Counsel of HUD's Office of Program Enforcement. ""Taxpayers deserve to know that the public programs they support are helping to meet the needs of the many, not the few.""
Background
Each year, HUD provides assistance to Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) primarily through its Public Housing Operating Fund and Public Housing Capital Fund. Annual subsidies under the Operating Fund are intended to support the operation and maintenance of public housing, enabling PHAs to serve low-, very low- and extremely low-income households. HUD's Capital Fund Program provides financial assistance to PHAs to make needed improvements to existing public housing. Between 2012 and 2015, ACHA received a combined $9,136,686 from HUD through these programs.
Wilson served as ACHA's Executive Director from 1989 until April of 2013. Franklin was ACHA's Finance Director from 2004 through April of 2013 when she became Executive Director, serving through March of 2015. HUD claims that in their respective capacities, Wilson and Franklin:
Used public funds to pay for unreasonable and unsubstantiated travel expenses, including charging the housing authority for both mileage and airfare, using the housing authority's credit card to pay for meals while collecting per diem, and using the housing authority's credit card to pay for hotels while collecting lodging vouchers; Used ACHA funds to pay personal expenses, such as personal meals and gift cards; Misused federal funds to make payments to the chairperson of the board of ACHA; Caused the housing authority to enter into an agreement with Wilson for consulting services in violation of conflict of interest rules; and, Wilson also caused ACHA to falsely certify to HUD that the housing authority was in compliance with Civil Rights laws and HUD's lead safety requirements.
• Used public funds to pay for unreasonable and unsubstantiated travel expenses, including charging the housing authority for both mileage and airfare, using the housing authority's credit card to pay for meals while collecting per diem, and using the housing authority's credit card to pay for hotels while collecting lodging vouchers;
• Used ACHA funds to pay personal expenses, such as personal meals and gift cards;
• Misused federal funds to make payments to the chairperson of the board of ACHA;
• Caused the housing authority to enter into an agreement with Wilson for consulting services in violation of conflict of interest rules; and,
• Wilson also caused ACHA to falsely certify to HUD that the housing authority was in compliance with Civil Rights laws and HUD's lead safety requirements.
In addition to the fraud complaint announced today, HUD is pursuing a related 'debarment action' against Wilson and Franklin, excluding them from doing any business with the Federal government indefinitely.

To help these Texans, the GLO is proud to team with our disaster recovery partners at HUD to help those who need help avoiding foreclosure or assistance in financing repairs to damaged homes. Texans who are having trouble making payments should contact their service providers to learn about available resources or call the FHA Resource Center at (800) CALL-FHA. Reach out now to get help.""
Over one-quarter of home loans in Texas are insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), an agency within HUD, which offers a range of payment and other relief options for borrowers living in Presidentially Declared Major Disaster Areas (PDMDAs). Borrowers who are having trouble making mortgage payments should contact their servicers to discuss available resources. In addition, HUD-approved housing counselors (https://www.hudexchange.info/onecpd/assets/File/Turn-to-a-HUD-Housing-Counselor-for-Help-English-FC.pdf) can assist in connecting impacted homeowners with the right options for relief. HUD also offers help for borrowers and loan servicers through its FHA Resource Center, (800) CALL-FHA.
Among the relief provided to homeowners affected by Hurricane Harvey, FHA has recently announced an extension to its 90-day foreclosure moratorium until February 21, 2018 to the FEMA designated Individual Assistance Areas in the PDMDAs. FHA-insured homeowners may qualify for this relief if they live or work in a PDMDA.
FHA also currently offers the following assistance:
Forbearance and loan modification options - HUD offers different forbearance and loan modification options for FHA borrowers affected by disasters. Borrowers having trouble making regular payments should contact their loan servicer as soon as possible for more information. Fees and credit reporting - HUD requires lenders to waive late fees on affected FHA borrowers and cease any negative credit reporting during the forbearance period. Mortgage insurance for disaster victims - HUD's Section 203(h) program provides FHA-insured mortgage financing to disaster victims who have lost their homes and are facing the daunting task of rebuilding or buying another home. Borrowers from participating FHA-approved lenders are eligible for 100 percent financing, including closing costs. Purchase and home rehabilitation program - HUD's Section 203(k) loan program enables those who have lost their homes to finance the purchase or refinance of a house along with its repair through a single mortgage. It also allows homeowners who have damaged houses to finance the rehabilitation of their existing single-family home. Collaborations with other federal agencies - HUD regularly shares information with FEMA and the State on housing providers that may have available units in the impacted counties - this includes Public Housing Agencies and Multi-Family owners. The Department will also connect FEMA and the State to subject matter experts to provide information on HUD programs and providers.

Patenaude will be joined by members of HUD's Disaster Recovery and Long-Term Housing Team.
""The HUD recovery team on the ground in Puerto Rico is comprised of key leadership and decision makers who will meet with Puerto Rican stakeholders to assess their long-term recovery needs,"" HUD Secretary Ben Carson said. ""This will ensure that we have the most current, up to date information available, which will be critical to decision makers as we develop a strong recovery plan to aid the people of Puerto Rico.""
In Puerto Rico, the HUD team will tour hurricane-damaged areas and meet with Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello and other elected and local officials. The HUD recovery team will also visit disaster recovery centers in Toa Baja and Bayamon.
""This is an opportunity for our leadership team to meet with key stakeholders and understand the damage first hand,"" said Patenaude. ""This will help us meet the needs of hurricane survivors as we continue to plan and coordinate long term housing solutions for our fellow Americans as they continue to recover.""
HUD programs play a significant role in Puerto Rico's housing stock, including contracts with approximately 203 multi-family properties that provide nearly 21,000 affordable housing units; funding for more than 54,000 public housing units; and Federal Housing Administration backed insurance for approximately 117,000 mortgages on single family homes.
""Our disaster response team has been working closely with the Federal Emergency Management Agency during the initial recovery stages of this disaster,"" said Patenaude. ""Our efforts this week are focused on understanding the scope of the housing rebuilding effort."""
12/06/2017:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2017/pr17-109.cfm,Homelessness Declines in Most Communities of the U.S. with Increases Reported in High-Cost Areas,"WASHINGTON - Homelessness crept up in the U.S., especially among individuals with long-term disabling conditions according to the latest national estimate by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). HUD's 2017 Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress (https://www.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/2017-AHAR-Part-1.pdf) found that 553,742 persons experienced homelessness on a single night in 2017, an increase of .7 percent since last year. Homelessness among families with children declined 5.4 percent nationwide since 2016, local communities report the number of persons experiencing long-term chronic homelessness and Veterans increased.
There is a great deal of variation in the data in different parts of the country, however, and many places continue to see reductions in homelessness. Thirty (30) states and the District of Columbia reported decreases in homelessness between 2016 and 2017. Challenges in some major metropolitan areas, however, have had a major impact on the national trend lines.
For example, the City and County of Los Angeles reported a nearly 26 percent increase in overall homelessness since 2016, primarily among those persons found in unsheltered locations. Meanwhile, New York City reported a 4.1 increase, principally among families in emergency shelters and transitional housing. Excluding these two areas, the estimated number of Veterans experiencing homeless in other parts of the nation decreased 3.1 percent since 2016.
""In many high-cost areas of our country, especially along the West Coast, the severe shortage of affordable housing is manifesting itself on our streets,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""With rents rising faster than incomes, we need to bring everybody to the table to produce more affordable housing and ease the pressure that is forcing too many of our neighbors into our shelters and onto our streets. This is not a federal problem-it's everybody's problem.""
""The fact that so many parts of the country are continuing to reduce homelessness gives us confidence that our strategies-and the dedicated efforts of communities to embrace best practices-have been working,"" said Matthew Doherty, executive director of the U.S. Interagency Council of Homelessness. ""At the same time, we know that some communities are facing challenges that require us to redouble our efforts across all levels of government and the public and private sectors, and we are committed to doing that work.""
""Our joint community-based homelessness efforts are working in most communities across the country. Despite a slight increase in overall Veteran homelessness, I am pleased that the majority of communities in the U.S. experienced declines over the past year,"" said U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin. ""VA remains committed to helping Veterans find stable housing. We will continue to identify innovative local solutions, especially in areas where higher rents have contributed to an increase in homelessness among Veterans.""
HUD's national estimate is based upon data reported by approximately 3,000 cities and counties across the nation. Every year on a single night in January, planning agencies called 'Continuums of Care' and tens of thousands of volunteers seek to identify the number of individuals and families living in emergency shelters, transitional housing programs and in unsheltered settings. These one-night 'snapshot' counts, as well as full-year counts and data from other sources (U.S. Housing Survey, Department of Education), are crucial in understanding the scope of homelessness and measuring progress toward reducing it.
Key Findings of HUD's 2017 Annual Homeless Assessment Report:
On a single night in January 2017, state and local planning agencies (Continuums of Care) reported:
553,742 people were homeless representing an overall .7 percent increase from 2016 and a 13.1 percent decrease since 2010. Most homeless persons (360,867) were located in emergency shelters or transitional housing programs while 192,875 persons were unsheltered. The number of families with children experiencing homelessness declined 5.4 percent since 2016 and 27 percent since 2010. Veteran homelessness increased 1.5 percent (or 585 persons) since January 2016, primarily in California cities. Since 2010, however, Veteran homelessness declined nationally by 46 percent. On a single night in January 2017, 40,056 veterans were experiencing homelessness. Chronic or long-term homelessness among individuals increased 12.2 percent over 2016 levels though declined by 18 percent (or 19,100 persons) since 2010. The number of unaccompanied homeless youth and children in 2017 is estimated to be 40,799. This year, HUD and local communities launched a more intense effort to more accurately account for this important, difficult to count population. HUD will treat 2017 as a baseline year for purposes of tracking progress toward reducing youth homelessness.

Homelessness Among All Persons
The total number of persons experiencing homelessness on a single night last January is 553,742, an increase of 0.7 percent from January 2016 largely attributed to the jump in unsheltered homelessness in larger cities in the West Coast
Family Homelessness
There were 58,000 families with children experiencing homelessness on a single night in 2017, a decline of 5.4 percent from the year before and a 27 percent reduction since 2010. These significant reductions in family homelessness is largely attributed to the expansion of Rapid Rehousing Programs across the country and a concerted effort by local planners to reallocate scarce resources in a more strategic way. These 'Housing First' models have proven to be a more effective and efficient response to families experiencing temporary crisis as well as those enduring the most chronic forms of homelessness.
Veteran Homelessness
Local communities reported a total of 40,056 Veterans experiencing homelessness in January of 2017, an increase of 1.5 percent since 2016, primarily in the City of Los Angeles and Los Angeles County. Excluding this area, the national homelessness estimate among Veterans decreased 3.2 percent since 2016. However, as a consequence of intense planning and targeted intervention, homelessness among Veterans has been reduced 46 percent since 2010, prompting a number of States and local communities to declare an effective end to Veteran homelessness in their areas (read more) (https://www.usich.gov/solutions/collaborative-leadership/mayors-challenge). This decline is largely attributed to the close collaboration between HUD and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). For example, since 2010, more than 480,000 veterans and their family members have been permanently housed, rapidly rehoused, or prevented from falling into homelessness through HUD's targeted housing vouchers and VA's homelessness programs.
Chronic Homelessness
Long-term or chronic homelessness among individuals with disabilities declined 18 percent since 2010. This reduction is due in part to a concerted effort to make available more permanent supportive housing opportunities for people with disabling health conditions who otherwise continually cycle through local shelters or the streets. Research demonstrates that for those experiencing chronic homelessness, providing permanent housing, coupled with appropriate low-barrier supportive services, is the most effective solution for ending homelessness. This 'housing first' approach also saves the taxpayer considerable money by interrupting a costly cycle of emergency room and hospital, detox, and even jail visits.
Homelessness in High-Cost Areas
HUD's 2017 homeless estimate points to a significant increase in the number of reported persons experiencing unsheltered homelessness, particularly in California where there is a significant lack of affordable housing. Last January, Los Angeles and Los Angeles County counted a total of 55,188 individuals living in sheltered and unsheltered settings, an increase of nearly 26 percent over January 2016.
The severe lack of affordable housing in California is also affecting the level of Veteran homelessness. In Los Angeles County alone, Veteran homelessness increased 64 percent since January 2016 which largely accounts for the 1.5 percent increase of Veteran homelessness nationwide.

12/07/2017:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2017/pr17-110.cfm,HUD Announces New FHA Loan Limits for 2018,"WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) today announced the agency's new schedule of loan limits for 2018, with most areas in the country to experience an increase in loan limits in the coming year. These loan limits are effective for FHA case numbers assigned on or after January 1, 2018.
Read FHA's Mortgagee Letter on 2018 Forward Mortgage Limits. Read FHA's Mortgagee Letter on 2018 Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) Limits.
• Read FHA's Mortgagee Letter on 2018 Forward Mortgage Limits.
• Read FHA's Mortgagee Letter on 2018 Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) Limits.
FHA is required by the National Housing Act, as amended by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA), to set Single Family forward loan limits at 115 percent of median house prices, subject to a floor and a ceiling on the limits. FHA calculates forward mortgage limits by Metropolitan Statistical Area and county.
In high-cost areas of the country, FHA's loan limit ceiling will increase to $679,650 from $636,150. FHA will also increase its floor to $294,515 from $275,665. Additionally, the National Mortgage Limit for FHA-insured Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECMs), or reverse mortgages, will increase to $679,650 from $636,150. FHA's current regulations implementing the National Housing Act's HECM limits do not allow loan limits for reverse mortgages to vary by MSA or county; instead, the single limit applies to all mortgages regardless of where the property is located.
Due to robust increases in median housing prices and required changes to FHA's floor and ceiling limits, which are tied to the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA)'s increase in the conventional mortgage loan limit for 2018, the maximum loan limits for FHA forward mortgages will rise in 3,011 counties. In 223 counties, FHA's loan limits will remain unchanged. By statute, the median home price for an MSA is based on the county within the MSA having the highest median price. It has been HUD's long-standing practice to utilize the highest median price point for any year since the enactment of HERA.
The National Housing Act, as amended by HERA, requires FHA to establish its floor and ceiling loan limits based on the loan limit set by FHFA for conventional mortgages owned or guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Today, FHA's minimum national loan limit, or floor, is set at 65 percent of the national conforming loan limit of $453,100. This floor applies to those areas where 115 percent of the median home price is less than the floor limit. Any areas where the loan limit exceeds this ‘floor' is considered a high-cost area, and HERA requires FHA to set its maximum loan limit ‘ceiling' for high-cost areas at 150 percent of the national conforming limit.
Prior to the passage of HERA, the National Housing Act (NHA) provided that the FHA mortgage limit for any given area be set at 95 percent of the median one-family house price in that area, as determined by HUD. However, the NHA further stated the FHA mortgage limit in any given area cannot exceed 87 percent of the Freddie Mac loan limit (305(a)(2) of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Act (12 U.S.C. 1454(a)(2)), nor be less than 48 percent of that limit. Since the enactment of HERA and The Economic Stimulus Act of 2008, which temporarily raised FHA limits even further, FHA's loan limits have been more closely tied to, and at times in excess of, those for GSE-eligible loans.
Based upon the volume of FHA endorsements in FY 2017, the following charts represent the number and share of counties where FHA loan limits are at the ceiling, floor and somewhere in between.

12/07/2017:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2017/pr17-111.cfm,FHA to Halt Insuring Mortgages on Homes with Pace Assessments,"WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) today announced it is reversing a short-lived policy announced in July of 2016 and will no longer insure new mortgages on properties that include Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) assessments. Read FHA's mortgagee letter.
FHA's decision is part of a larger effort to protect the health of its Single Family Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMIF) and the borrowers who rely upon it. Last month, FHA released its latest annual report on the fiscal health of the MMIF finding the Fund had a total economic net worth of $25.6 billion and the Capital Ratio that remains above the statutory minimum for a third straight year. Read more about FHA's FY2017 Annual Report.
""FHA can no longer tolerate putting taxpayers at risk by allowing obligations like these to be placed ahead of the mortgage itself in the event of a default,"" said U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson. ""Assessments such as these are potentially dangerous for our Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund and may have serious consequences on a consumer's ability to repay, or when they attempt to refinance their mortgage or sell their home.""
FHA is also very concerned about PACE obligations being placed on FHA-insured mortgages that are already outstanding. The post-endorsement placement of these assessments on an FHA-insured mortgage creates a lack of transparency making it difficult for the agency to understand the true nature of the risks involved. In addition, such activity is risky for FHA borrowers and potentially violates the terms of their FHA-insured mortgage. FHA intends to monitor this carefully to determine whether further action is warranted."
12/07/2017:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2017/pr17-112.cfm,HUD Secretary Ben Carson Launches Envision Center Initiative,"Today, Dr. Ben Carson, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced the launch of EnVision Centers, a new initiative designed to help HUD-assisted households achieve self-sufficiency.
Located on or near public housing developments, EnVision Centers will be centralized hubs that serve as an incubator for the four key pillars of self- sufficiency; character and leadership, educational advancement, economic empowerment, and health and wellness. Through results-driven partnerships with federal agencies, state and local governments, non-profits, faith-based organizations, corporations, public housing authorities, and housing finance agencies, EnVision Centers will leverage public-private resources for maximum community impact.
""While funding for HUD has increased over the last twenty years, the number of households served has remained the same. We need to think differently about how we can empower Americans to climb the ladder of success,"" Secretary Carson said. ""EnVision Centers are designed to help people take the first few steps towards self-sufficiency. Every household we are able to help graduate from HUD-assistance allows HUD to help one more family in need.""
As a part of the initiative, HUD will launch ten pilot EnVision Centers across the country. HUD is also launching a mobile app to help HUD-assisted households find local resources through the EnVision Center network, and issuing a notice in the Federal Register to get input from the public.
""We have made connecting hard-working Michiganders with high-demand, high-wage careers in the professional trades a priority and I appreciate that my federal partners are doing the same with EnVision Centers,"" Michigan Governor Rick Snyder said. ""By helping people get the training necessary to succeed in these fields, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development is helping individuals earn a great future for themselves and their families while addressing a growing talent gap in the job market.""

12/14/2017:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2017/pr17-115.cfm,"HUD Reaches Fair Housing Agreement with Bay Area Landlord and Manager, Settling Disability Discrimination Complaints","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it reached a Conciliation Agreement with the owner and property manager of Shadowbrook Gardens Senior Townhomes in Morgan Hill, California, a city in Santa Clara County, resolving allegations that they discriminated against a resident with disabilities. Read the Conciliation Agreement.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in the sale or rental of a dwelling because of disability, including prohibiting residents from having live-in assistance and refusing to make reasonable accommodations in policies or practices when a person with a disability requires such an accommodation.
""Residents with disabilities have the right to reasonable accommodations that allow them to use and enjoy their home, without unnecessary and invasive questioning,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue to work with housing providers to ensure they meet their obligation to comply with national fair housing laws.""
The agreement resolves a complaint brought by a resident with a mobility impairment alleging that the owner and property manager of Shadowbrook Gardens discriminated against her because of her disability. According to the complaint, she requested to have a live-in aide and a key to a locked gate near her unit that would make it easier for her to come and go. In both instances, the owner and property manager allegedly asked her intrusive questions about her disability, challenged whether she really had a disability, asserted that the development was for individuals who could live independently, and ultimately denied her requests. The nonprofit group Project Sentinel, a HUD Fair Housing Initiatives Program agency, assisted the resident with filing her complaint and later filed its own complaint.
Under the terms of the Conciliation Agreement, the owner and property manager will pay $4,000 to the resident and $7,000 to Project Sentinel, which will use the money to further its fair housing mission. The agreement also requires the owner to keep the gate near the resident's unit unlocked or provide her with a key; allows the resident to have a live-in caregiver; and requires the owner and property manager to obtain fair housing training and implement a reasonable accommodation policy that complies with the Fair Housing Act.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to www.hud.gov/fairhousing, or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple and Android devices."
12/15/2017:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2017/pr17-114.cfm,HUD Marks 25 Years of Helping Families Become Self-Sufficient,"WASHINGTON - Twenty-five years ago this year, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) launched a program to help households living in assisted housing to become self-sufficient. Today, HUD marked the 25th anniversary of the Family Self-Sufficiency Program (FSS) by awarding $75 million to continue helping public housing residents, those participating in the Housing Choice Voucher Program and residents of Project-Based Rental Assistance to further their education and find good jobs. Read more about the local impact of the grants announced today. HUD Secretary Ben Carson made the funding announcement this morning at a FSS anniversary commemoration with the District of Columbia Housing Authority in Washington.
""A necessary part of what we do is to help families move beyond HUD assistance by providing the tools they need to become self-sufficient,"" said Secretary Carson. ""For 25 years, HUD and our local partners have been connecting residents to job training, childcare and other resources that expand their opportunities and lead them towards higher paying jobs and self-sufficiency.""
HUD's FSS Program helps local Public Housing Authorities to hire Service Coordinators who work directly with residents to connect them with programs and services that already exist in the local community. The program encourages innovative strategies that link housing assistance with a broad spectrum of services that will enable participating families to find jobs, increase earned income, reduce or eliminate the need for rental and/or welfare assistance, and make progress toward achieving economic independence and housing self-sufficiency.
Participants in the program sign a five-year contract that requires the head of the household to obtain employment and that no member of the household will receive certain types of public assistance at the end of the five-year term. Families in the FSS program have an interest-bearing escrow account established for them. The amount credited to the family's escrow account is based on increases in the family's earned income during the term of the FSS contract. If the family successfully completes its FSS contract, the family receives the escrow funds that it can use for any purpose, including debt reduction in order to improve credit scores, educational expenses, or a down payment on a home.
During the 10-year period from 2007-2016, the average household income of FSS participant more than doubled from approximately $10,000 at the time of entry into the program to more than $27,000 upon completion.

EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take three months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, six months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2 percent) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percentage change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percentage changes are 90 percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percentage changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised 3 percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau's website (https://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/how_the_data_are_collected/index.html).
* The 90 percent confidence interval includes zero. In such cases, there is insufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero."

The guide provides homeowners with information on the critical first steps to take if they are at risk of missing a mortgage payment or facing foreclosure.
HUD Secretary Ben Carson said, ""This guide arms consumers with easy to understand, reliable information about the assistance available to help them keep their homes. Valuable information like this can make a tremendous difference in the lives of homeowners who may be faced with foreclosure.""
This guide ensures homeowners will have resources at their fingertips and will be ready and responsible for the next steps. The guide also covers the value of HUD-approved housing counseling agencies. They are on the front lines providing resources to help homeowners avoid foreclosure. These HUD-approved housing counseling agencies offer free assistance to consumers and help borrowers find housing counselors and avoid scams.
As families recover from the recent hurricanes and are more likely to be targeted by scams, a HUD-approved housing counselor can assist them through the process of purchasing or keeping a home. Independent research shows that borrowers working with a HUD-approved housing counseling agency are more likely to avoid foreclosure than borrowers who do not seek housing counseling.
""Steering consumers away from fraudulent schemes is especially important when they are already facing the difficult situation of not being able to make their mortgage payment,"" said Sarah Gerecke, Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Office of Housing Counseling at HUD.
As part of the partnership between HUD, Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Agriculture, the Treasury Department, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Federal Housing Finance Agency, Mortgage Bankers Association, and housing counseling agencies, the guide will be available on federal agency and industry partner websites."
12/22/2017:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2017/pr17-118.cfm,HUD Awards $37 Million to Renew Support to 32 Local HIV-AIDS Housing Programs,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced $37 million to assist more than 4,000 low-income persons living with HIV/AIDS and their families annually over a three-year period. The funding announced today is offered through HUD's Housing Opportunities for Persons With AIDS Program (HOPWA) and will renew HUD's support of 32 local programs. These grants provide a combination of housing assistance and supportive services for this vulnerable population.
""We know there's a strong connection between health and stable housing. Having a place to call home can make a world of difference to someone who is trying to not only manage their health but also to avoid experiencing homelessness,"" said Secretary Ben Carson. ""These grants will assist our partners on the ground who provide housing and care for low-income persons living with HIV/AIDS.""
Research shows that a stable home is critical to the well-being of persons living with HIV/AIDS, and results in better health and reduced transmission of the disease. In addition to housing assistance, these local programs will provide access to supportive services such as case management, mental health services, substance abuse services, and employment training. The combination of housing assistance and supportive services are critical in sustaining housing stability, promoting better health outcomes, and increasing quality of life, which promotes self-sufficiency efforts for those able to transition to the private housing market.
Since 1992, HUD's HOPWA Program, managed by the Office of HIV/AIDS Housing, has provided national leadership and resources that support the development and operation of high-quality supportive housing programs. Under the HOPWA Program, HUD makes grants to cities, states, and nonprofit organizations to provide housing assistance and supportive services to low-income persons living with HIV/AIDS and their families. By providing assistance with housing and related services, the HOPWA program helps persons living with HIV/AIDS enter into housing, access and remain in medical care, and adhere to complex treatment regimens. More information on the HOPWA program is available at https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/hopwa/.
