01/12/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-004.cfm,HUD Awards Nearly $105 Million to Protect Families from Home Health and Safety Hazards,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today awarded nearly $104.7 million to 60 non-profit organizations, and state and local government agencies located in 29 states to protect children and families from home health hazards.
HUD is providing these grants through its Healthy Homes Production Grant Program which will help grantees identify health and safety hazards in low-income families' homes. The grants will protect children and families with incomes at or below eighty percent of the area median income level by targeting significant lead and health hazards in over 7,400 low-income homes for which other resources are not available.
""By providing these grants, HUD makes it clear that ensuring healthy and safe homes for communities across our nation is a priority,"" said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""HUD is working every day to keep families safe from home health hazards like lead paint because for many Americans, their home is a primary determinate of their health, and that is why HUD is committed to protecting families from these hazards and to providing healthy and sustainable housing for all Americans.""
The grants announced today emphasize the Biden-Harris Administration's commitment to solving the nation's lead crisis. In December, HUD awarded nearly $13.2 million in grants to state and local government agencies in 3 states through its Lead Based Paint Hazard Reduction (LBPHR) Grant Program to identify and clean up dangerous lead, and health and safety hazards in low-income families' homes.
The Healthy Homes Production Grant Program takes a comprehensive approach to addressing multiple childhood diseases and injuries in the home by focusing on housing-related hazards in a coordinated fashion, rather than addressing a single hazard at a time. The program builds upon HUD's successful Lead Hazard Control programs to expand the Department's efforts to holistically address a variety of high-priority housing-based health and safety hazards, such as mold and moisture, poor indoor air quality, pests, carbon monoxide, injury and safety hazards, in addition to lead-based paint.
In the coming weeks, grantees will begin setting up and implementing their programs and will make applications available for families who are interested and eligible for their local Healthy Homes Program.
Below is a project-by-project breakdown of the funding announced today:"

01/12/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-006.cfm,HUD Announces $14 Million Loan Guarantee to Palm Beach to Help Businesses Grow and Create Jobs,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today announced a $14 million loan guarantee to the County of Palm Beach, Florida to offer financing to companies expanding or establishing business operations in Palm Beach County. As a condition of financing, the County will require that at least 51% of the jobs created or retained by these businesses must be held by people with low- and moderate-incomes residing within the county.
""We begin this year by reiterating the Community Development Block Grant's commitment to building strong, resilient communities and meeting the needs of low- and moderate-income households across this country,"" said Arthur Jemison, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary, Office of Community Planning and Development. ""This loan guarantee will demonstrate how HUD programs and resources can strengthen businesses, especially those owned by minority, low- and moderate-income persons, in Palm Beach County and beyond.""
""Palm Beach County thanks HUD for its commitment to our community and its business owners,"" said Palm Beach County Commissioner Melissa McKinlay. ""Thanks to this $14 million loan guarantee, our County will continue to attract businesses, create more jobs, and create equal opportunity for all residents. It has been beneficial to all corners of Palm Beach County, especially our rural communities in the Glades.""
The loan guarantee assistance was awarded through the Section 108 Loan Guarantee Program (Section 108), which provides Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) recipients with the ability to leverage their annual grant allocation to access low-cost, flexible financing for economic development, housing, public facility, and infrastructure projects. The County will use the added Section 108 Loan funds to replenish its current loan pool to continue its successful Loan Fund project.
To date, Palm Beach County has provided 50 Section 108 loans to for-profit businesses leading to the creation of over two thousand jobs. Sixty percent of loans have been disbursed in low and moderate-income communities, and 82 percent of loans have been disbursed to minority recipients. The average loan amount has been approximately $507,000 and over two thousand jobs have been created.
The Section 108 Loan Guarantee Program allows local governments to leverage 5 times their current CDBG award into federally guaranteed loans large enough to pursue physical and economic revitalization projects capable of redeveloping entire neighborhoods. Public investment, such as Section 108 loans, can spur private economic activity, providing the resources or the confidence that private firms and individuals may need to invest in distressed areas. Read more about HUD's Section 108 Loan Guarantee Program (www.hudexchange.info/programs/section-108/).
As the need for economic recovery and community development continues, HUD's Section 108 program serves as a critical source of federal financing that helps to move projects forward and build strong, sustainable, inclusive communities."
01/13/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-007.cfm,FHA Expands Real-Estate Owned Property Purchase Opportunities for Owner-Occupant Buyers,"WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) on Thursday announced it is increasing its exclusive listing period on certain HUD single-family real-estate owned (REO) homes to allow more time for owner occupants, HUD-approved nonprofit organizations, and governmental entities to submit bids for the purchase of these homes before they become eligible for purchase by investors. This expansion is the latest action consistent with the Biden-Harris Administration's housing supply announcement (www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/09/01/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-immediate-steps-to-increase-affordable-housing-supply/) on September 1, 2021, that it would seek to make more HUD-owned properties available to owner-occupants and non-profit organizations.
Beginning March 1, 2022, this exclusive listing period for individuals, families, HUD-approved nonprofit organizations, and governmental entities will increase from the current 15 days to 30 days for new listings of single family homes listed as ""insured"" or ""insured with escrow"" on HUD's REO sale site, HUD HomeStore (www.hudhomestore.gov/Home/Index.aspx). Properties with these designations are eligible for FHA-insured financing under the FHA 203(b) program, meaning that they meet FHA's minimum property standards and may only require cosmetic repairs or non-structural repairs up to $10,000.
""FHA is actively supporting the Administration's efforts to increase the supply of affordable housing and provide more opportunities to those who have traditionally faced barriers to homeownership,"" said Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Housing and the Federal Housing Administration Lopa P. Kolluri. ""By extending the time frame individuals have to bid on an REO property, we are offering families a better chance to purchase a quality HUD-owned home to live in, build equity, and create generational wealth.""
Today's announcement is the latest in a number of actions FHA is taking to meet the objectives outlined in President Biden's September 1, 2021, announcement to support affordable homeownership. Previously, on December 1, 2021, HUD executed a competitive bid HUD-held vacant loan sale where it provided priority bidding opportunities on 50 percent of the mortgage notes in multi-loan pools to non-profits and units of local government. A record 23 mission-driven non-profit organizations successfully participated in the sale, with 11 non-profit organizations winning pools and acquiring the full 50 percent of the total number of loans offered for sale."
01/18/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-008.cfm,HUD Announces $83 Million to Deliver Equitable COVID-19 Relief to Tribal Communities,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced the awarding of more than $83 million in Indian Community Block Grant-American Rescue Plan (ICDBG-ARP) grants to 74 Tribal communities to prevent, prepare for, and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. This is the third round of ICDBG-ARP awards, underscoring the Biden-Harris Administration's commitment to delivering equitable COVID-19 relief to Tribal communities.
A breakdown of the awards by recipient is available here.
These funds to Tribes will help protect the health and safety of their communities, particularly low- and moderate-income individuals and families, by expanding access to safe housing, a suitable living environment, and economic opportunities.
""It is imperative that we continue providing Tribal communities with resources needed to protect the health and safety of their communities,"" said HUD Deputy Secretary Adrianne Todman. ""With the funding HUD is awarding today, we remain diligent in continuing our mission to ensure that every person has the security of a healthy home and community. HUD will continue to strengthen partnerships with Tribal communities to ensure that all communities receive equitable relief.""
Today's announcement follows HUD's previous awards of $74 million in ICDBG-ARP grants to 68 Tribal communities in November and $52 million in ICDBG-ARP grants to 49 Tribal communities in December. The American Rescue Plan included a total of $280 million for the Indian Community Development Block Grant program; HUD will announce additional ICDBG-ARP awards on a rolling basis.
The Department and the Biden-Harris Administration have made delivering equitable COVID-19 relief to Tribal communities a priority. The American Rescue Plan Act provides a total of $750 million dollars in HUD resources to Indian Country to support the continued fight against COVID-19. In 2021, HUD made a historic $450 million investment in Indian Housing Block Grants (IHBG-ARP) to Indian tribes across the country to respond to COVID-19. The Department also invested $5 million in COVID-19 relief for Native Hawaiians.
HUD and the Biden-Harris Administration remain committed to meeting and prioritizing the needs of Native communities."

01/20/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-011.cfm,FACT SHEET: HUD Year 1,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) over the last year has taken bold action in pursuit of the agency's mission to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes. These actions aligned with key Biden-Harris Administration priorities including ensuring equity, removing barriers to homeownership, expanding the nation's housing supply, and keeping Americans housed. Below are the agency's top accomplishments from the last year.
Launched a Whole-of-Government Effort to Ensure All Americans Are Treated Fairly in the Home Appraisals Process. On June 1, President Biden tasked Secretary Fudge with leading a first-of-its-kind interagency initiative to address inequity in home appraisals and help families of color build wealth. In partnership with Ambassador Susan Rice and the Domestic Policy Council, HUD created the Property Appraisal and Valuation Equity (PAVE) Task Force, bringing together federal agencies to identify and utilize all levers at their disposal to root out discrimination in the home appraisal process. The report to the President will document the scope of the problem and provide detailed, actionable agency commitments.
Launched All-Hands-on-Deck Effort to Address Homelessness Crisis. On September 20, Secretary Fudge launched House America, a national partnership with other Administration officials, mayors, county officials, governors, and tribal nation leaders across the nation. The plan works with those leaders to use American Rescue Plan (ARP) resources to re-house at least 100,000 people experiencing homelessness and add at least 20,000 new affordable and permanent supportive housing units to address homelessness into the development pipeline by the end of 2022.
Prevented Evictions and Foreclosures. HUD helped prevent eviction of HUD-assisted households and stabilize families struggling because of the COVID-19 pandemic by deploying the historic funding made available under the Consolidated Appropriations Act and ARP to help keep families stably housed. HUD worked closely with the White House and the Treasury Department, providing the Department's expertise to inform Emergency Rental Assistance Program policy guidance and lift up best practices. HUD helped homeowners behind on their mortgages stay in their homes by extending mortgage forbearance. As borrowers leave forbearance, HUD worked with Treasury to integrate the Homeowner Assistance Fund with new policies released by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) to help struggling homeowners keep their homes. As a result of HUD and other federal government actions and supports, evictions and foreclosures were well below historic averages.
Stood Up a New $5 Billion HOME-ARP Program to Assist Some of The Country's Most Vulnerable Populations. The Office of Community Planning and Development has made funding available to 651 state and local governments, which will be used to reduce homelessness and increase housing stability by providing funding for rental housing development, acquisition and development of non-congregate shelter, tenant-based rental assistance, and supportive services. HUD released a portion of grantee administrative funds at the outset of the program to better support the planning activities that lead to effective use of grant funding.
Provided Emergency Housing Vouchers (EHVs). As part of ARP, HUD provided 70,000 housing choice vouchers to local Public Housing Authorities (PHAs). These vouchers assist individuals and families who are homeless, at-risk of homelessness, fleeing, or attempting to flee, domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, stalking, or human trafficking, are formerly incarcerated, or were recently homeless or have a high risk of housing instability. HUD requires PHAs to partner with local Continuums of Care to ensure that eligible households are referred to this voucher program.
Removed Barriers to Homeownership for Those with Student Loan Debt. The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) updated its policy on student loan monthly payment calculations to remove barriers and provide more access to affordable single-family FHA-insured mortgage financing for creditworthy individuals with student loan debt, which has disproportionate impact on communities of color. The updates removed the previous requirement that lenders calculate a borrower's student loan monthly payment of one percent of the outstanding student loan balance for student loans that are not fully amortizing. The new policy bases the monthly payment on the actual student loan payment, more closely aligning FHA policies with industry standards.
Set the Stage for Increased Fair Housing and Lending Enforcement and Access. HUD signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) to kick off a historic collaboration on fair housing and fair lending enforcement and oversight engagement with the FHFA-regulated entities including Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Banks. This comprehensive effort will ensure deeper collaboration on fair housing investigations and enable data sharing to help strengthen and affirmatively further fair housing for the mortgage industry. In addition, HUD Published a legal memorandum making it clear that certain Special Purpose Credit Programs (SPCPs) that are lawful under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) generally are not barred by the Fair Housing Act, allowing their use by lenders to expand access to credit in underserved communities.
Took Action to Increase Housing Supply and Access to Affordable Housing. HUD restarted its Housing Finance Agency (HFA) risk-sharing program with Treasury's Federal Financing Bank (FFB) on September 1 to develop more affordable rental homes. The program allows HFAs to obtain FHA insurance on multifamily mortgages they underwrite, with HUD and the HFA sharing the risk of any potential loss. FHA anticipates that approximately 20,000 affordable rental homes will be created or preserved through the program through 2027. HUD also made more single-family homes available to individuals, families, and non-profit organizations – rather than large investors – by prioritizing homeownership and limiting sale to large investors of certain FHA-insured and HUD-owned properties. Finally, HUD released new research on actions that state and local governments can take to increase their housing supply and is developing a Housing Supply Toolkit filled with easy-to-implement strategies for grantees to deploy HUD resources to address supply and affordability challenges that have been deepened by the pandemic.
Restored the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing (AFFH) Requirement. The Department published an interim final rule (IFR) that went into effect on July 31st to restore the implementation of the Fair Housing Act's AFFH requirement. Under the restored AFFH regulatory definition in the IFR, HUD funding recipients must regularly certify compliance with the Fair Housing Act's AFFH requirement and commit to taking steps to remedy their fair housing issues in making such certifications. The IFR helps HUD, 3,747 public housing authorities, and 1,200 state and local government grantees in the CDBG, HOME, and HOPWA programs fulfill their AFFH obligations under the Fair Housing Act.
Strengthened Mutual Mortgage Insurance (MMI) Fund. HUD announced a historically strong Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund Report showing that, in addition to its emphasis on delivering relief options to homeowners financially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, FHA continued to deliver on its mission of enabling homeownership for first-time and low- and moderate-income, and households of color. The Fund remains well positioned to withstand future economic events and endure the outcomes from the pandemic-induced delinquencies that remain in forbearance or are seriously delinquent. The percentage of first-time homebuyers using FHA insurance reached a new high and the share of mortgages insured by FHA to minority borrowers reached almost 42 percent of all FHA forward mortgage insurance endorsements. FHA served double the percentage of Black and Hispanic borrowers when compared to those served through mortgage originations by the rest of the housing market this past fiscal year.
Protected the LGBTQ+ Community from Housing Discrimination. On February 11th, HUD announced that it would interpret the Fair Housing Act to bar discrimination on the bases of sexual orientation and gender identity, consistent with President Biden's Executive Order 13988 and the Supreme Court's ruling in Bostock v. Clayton County. This decision has expanded the protections of the Fair Housing Act to a community that has historically been subject to discrimination. Through its partner FHIPs and FHAPs agencies, HUD has processed 235 cases alleging sex discrimination due to gender identity and sexual orientation last year, nearly twice as many cases than last year.

01/24/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-013.cfm,"HUD Awards More Than $51 Million in Grants to Support Housing Counseling Programs, Partnerships with Minority Serving Institutions, and Training","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) on Monday awarded $51.4 million in housing counseling grants to 177 HUD-approved housing counseling agencies and intermediary organizations. This includes funding to HUD-approved housing counseling agencies that are partnering with Historically Black College and Universities (HBCUs), Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs), or other Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs). The funding supports housing counseling agencies in their critical work to stem the tide of the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on housing, maintain housing stability by helping families with foreclosure and rental eviction prevention, and help families make more informed housing choices. The awards also include funding to further training and education to attract and retain more housing counseling professionals.
""Whether a family is seeking affordable rental housing, buying their first home, or struggling to stay in current housing, now more than ever, housing counselors are supporting families' housing needs,"" said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""We are pleased to announce these grants to 177 HUD-approved housing counseling agencies across the country to support their work and continue HUD's mission to ensure every American has access to safe, stable housing.""
$49.4 million of the grants awarded today will directly support the housing counseling services provided by HUD-approved local housing counseling agencies, national and regional organizations, multi-state organizations, and state housing finance agencies. HUD awarded $3 million of this funding to 16 HUD-approved housing counseling agencies that are partnering with HBCUs, HSIs, or other MSIs. This funding is designed to expand these institutions' roles and effectiveness in addressing the needs of their local communities and further their partnerships with housing counseling agencies. Recipients of these grants participated in the Department's two-year Comprehensive Housing Counseling Grant Program Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) published September 14, 2021.
Today HUD also awarded an additional $2 million under its fiscal year 2021 Housing Counseling Training Notice of Funding Opportunity (TNOFO) published on November 2, 2021. These grants support education and training of housing counselors. The TNOFO includes training on how to provide counseling for seniors seeking Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECM), and training on HUD's housing counselor certification exam. HUD is awarding $300,000 of the $2 million to recipient organizations that will issue training scholarships to students of HBCUs, Tribal Colleges and Universities, and other MSIs enrolled in a housing counseling workforce development program.

01/25/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-014.cfm,"HUD Announces $700,000 Loan Guarantee for the City of Pekin to Improve Fire Protection","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced a $700,000 loan guarantee to the City of Pekin, Illinois for the purchase of a fire truck for the City's Fire Station #3. The loan guarantee will support improved fire protection in a service area that is primarily residential and low- and moderate-income.
""This loan guarantee reiterates HUD's commitment to the safety and well-being of families and communities,"" said Arthur Jemison, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary, Office of Community Planning and Development at HUD. ""We believe that everyone in this nation has the right to a safe and secure home, and that includes assisting cities with financing services that ensure safety for all communities.""
The loan guarantee assistance was awarded through the Section 108 Loan Guarantee Program (Section 108), which provides Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) recipients with the ability to leverage their annual grant allocation to access low-cost, flexible financing for economic development, housing, public facility, and infrastructure projects.
This project will meet the Community Development Block Grant national objective of benefit to low- and moderate-income persons in a target area. The proposed project's service area in Pekin will be within a Census Tract that is primarily residential and 51.3 percent low- and moderate-income.
The Section 108 Loan Guarantee Program allows local governments to leverage 5 times their current CDBG award into federally guaranteed loans large enough to pursue physical and economic revitalization projects capable of redeveloping entire neighborhoods. Public investment, such as Section 108 loans, can spur private economic activity, providing the resources or the confidence that private firms and individuals may need to invest in distressed areas. Read more about HUD's Section 108 Loan Guarantee Program (www.hudexchange.info/programs/section-108/).
As the need for economic recovery and community development continues, HUD's Section 108 program serves as a critical source of federal financing that helps to move projects forward and build strong, sustainable, inclusive communities."
01/25/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-015.cfm,HUD Publishes Notice to Extend Length of Housing Support to Foster Youth,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) on January 24, 2022, published a notice (www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/01/24/2022-01285/implementation-of-the-fostering-stable-housing-opportunities-amendments) in the Federal Register implementing and providing guidance on the provisions of the Fostering Stable Housing Opportunities (FSHO) amendments as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021. FSHO serves to help reduce the incidence of homelessness among former foster youth by providing them with housing assistance for a more extended period to focus on advancing their education, improving their career and employment prospects, and building financial security.
The FSHO amends the Family Unification Program (FUP) under Section 8 of the U.S. Housing Act to increase the amount of time that youth may receive a FUP voucher. Under FSHO, former foster youth will be able to receive up to an additional 24 months of voucher assistance, for a maximum of 60 months of voucher assistance. This service extension is also available to youth receiving a Foster Youth to Independence (FYI) voucher.
""FSHO is unique in that it was conceived and drafted by foster youth and former foster youth who truly understand the challenges of aging out of foster care and what support towards an independent and successful future should look like,"" said Danielle Bastarache, HUD Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public Housing and Voucher Programs. ""Every person, especially every young person, deserves the inherent security of a safe and stable home. Our Department continues to be committed to expanding assistance to public housing agencies across the country so that they can support more individuals in their future success.""
FSHO applies to FUP/FYI youth who first leased or leases a unit after the date of the enactment of the 2021 Appropriations Act (i.e., December 27, 2020). The FSHO makes this extension of assistance available to youth participating in a Family Self-Sufficiency (FSS) program. If the Public Housing Authority (PHA) does not have an FSS program or the PHA has an FSS program in which the youth has been unable to enroll, the youth may receive an extension of assistance if they engaged in education, workforce, or employment activities for at least 9-months out of the 12 months preceding the extension. The FSHO will provide limited exceptions for youth whose personal circumstances make them unable to engage in such activities. Exceptions include:
The FUP/FYI youth is a parent or other household member responsible for the care of a dependent child under the age of 6 or the care of an incapacitated person; The FUP/FYI youth is a person who is regularly and actively participating in a drug addiction or alcohol treatment and rehabilitation program; The FUP/FYI youth is a person who is incapable of complying with the requirement to participate in a Family Self-Sufficiency (FSS) program or engage in education, workforce development, or employment activities, as applicable, due to a documented medical condition.
• The FUP/FYI youth is a parent or other household member responsible for the care of a dependent child under the age of 6 or the care of an incapacitated person;
• The FUP/FYI youth is a person who is regularly and actively participating in a drug addiction or alcohol treatment and rehabilitation program;
• The FUP/FYI youth is a person who is incapable of complying with the requirement to participate in a Family Self-Sufficiency (FSS) program or engage in education, workforce development, or employment activities, as applicable, due to a documented medical condition.
The enactment of these amendments recognizes the critical role that stable housing plays in helping former foster youth transition to independence and self-sufficiency.
This notice is part of HUD's continued commitment to Foster Youth. In December, HUD announced $1 million in grants to public housing agencies (PHAs) across the country to provide housing assistance to youth who are aging out of foster care and are homeless or at risk of homelessness. Preceding these announcements, HUD's Foster Youth to Independence team was awarded a 2021 Samuel J. Heyman Service to America Medals (Sammies) in the fall of 2021. The Department is dedicated to assisting communities in ensuring that every person in the nation has access to safe, affordable, and stable housing so that they can equitably thrive."
01/26/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-016.cfm,HUD and Census Bureau Report New Residential Sales in December 2021,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Census Bureau jointly announced the following new residential sales statistics for December 2021:

New Home Sales Sales of new single-family houses in December 2021 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 811,000, according to estimates released jointly today by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. This is 11.9 percent (±20.3 percent)* above the revised November rate of 725,000 but is 14.0 percent (±16.6 percent)* below the December 2020 estimate of 943,000.
Sales Price The median sales price of new houses sold in December 2021 was $377,700. The average sales price was $457,300.
For Sale Inventory and Months' Supply The seasonally-adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of December was 403,000. This represents a supply of 6.0 months at the current sales rate.

EXPLANATORY NOTES
These statistics are estimated from sample surveys. They are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated average relative standard errors of the preliminary data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. Changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show irregular movement. It takes 4 months to establish a trend for new houses sold. Preliminary new home sales figures are subject to revision due to the survey methodology and definitions used. The survey is primarily based on a sample of houses selected from building permits. Since a ""sale"" is defined as a deposit taken or sales agreement signed, this can occur prior to a permit being issued. An estimate of these prior sales is included in the sales figure. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimate of total sales is revised about 4.6 percent. Changes in sales price data reflect changes in the distribution of houses by region, size, etc., as well as changes in the prices of houses with identical characteristics. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau's website (www.census.gov/construction/nrs/how_the_data_are_collected/index.html).
* The 90 percent confidence interval includes zero. In such cases, there is insufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero."
01/26/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-017.cfm,HUD Announces $4 Million Radon Testing Notice of Funding Opportunity,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is making available $4 million through HUD's new Radon Testing and Mitigation Demonstration Program Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) for public housing agencies. PHAs will use the funds in public housing properties where low-income families reside. With this funding, PHAs will be able to conduct testing and, when needed, mitigation of radon in the public housing units that they manage. Read HUD's Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO).
""This new program is part of HUD's overall effort to reduce disparities in the health of low-income families compared to the overall population,"" said Matthew Ammon, Director of HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes. ""Too many families are at risk of serious illness because of exposure to radon, and we will continue our efforts to keep families, including children, safe.""
The grants that will be awarded through the NOFO announced today will also provide HUD with important information on methods and costs for radon testing and mitigation in public housing around the country. The funds for these grants will come available early this summer, and PHAs can apply for the funds through Grants.gov (www.grants.gov/).
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that about 1 in 15 homes (7 percent) in the U.S. have elevated radon levels. The EPA also estimates that about 21,000 people die in the U.S. annually due to lung cancer from radon exposure.
Radon is an odorless, colorless radioactive gas that is a decay product of elements in soil and rock and is present in every part of the country. Low levels of radon are found in the outside air. Radon gas can move through the soil and enter buildings through small openings in the foundation or basement and become concentrated in the indoor air environment. When radon is inhaled, it can damage DNA in lung tissue and increase the risk of developing lung cancer. Radon is the number one cause of lung cancer among non-smokers, according to EPA estimates."

WASHINGTON, D.C. - Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Marcia L. Fudge and Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser participated in the 2022 Point-in-Time (PIT) Count on Wednesday night in Washington, D.C. The PIT Count is a count of sheltered and unsheltered people experiencing homelessness on a single night in January.
Secretary Fudge and Mayor Bowser joined Pathways to Housing D.C. staff and volunteers to administer the PIT Count survey to those experiencing homelessness.
""The PIT Count is one of the most important tools the federal government has to understand local needs and to measure trends in homelessness through an annual single-night snapshot,"" said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""And that's why it was so important for me to participate in this year's count and to hear directly from people we serve. At HUD, with the support of the Biden-Harris Administration, we will continue to put Housing First at the top of our priorities to bring us closer to the goal of ending homelessness.""
""We are proud of the progress we're making in Washington, D.C. to make homelessness rare, brief, and nonrecurring; but there's more work to do. And what we know is that we have a partner in the Biden-Harris Administration,"" said D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser. ""In 2021, D.C. was top among states in getting out $352 million in Emergency Rental Assistance - funds that have been used to prevent homelessness and ensure more residents have access to safe and dignified housing. We look forward to working with Secretary Fudge and the rest of the Housing and Urban Development team to build on that progress so that our nation's capital can continue to be an example of what is possible when local and federal governments work together to tackle our greatest challenges.""
HUD requires that Continuums of Care conduct a count of people experiencing homelessness who are sheltered in emergency shelter, transitional housing, and Safe Havens and who are unsheltered on a single night at least once every other year. Each count is planned, coordinated, and carried out locally. The PIT Count is a critical way for HUD to identify the needs of people experiencing homelessness and to allocate federal resources to meet those needs, offering a snapshot of homelessness – both sheltered and unsheltered - on a single night. The key findings of the PIT Count are outlined (www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/ahar.html) in the Annual Homeless Assessment Report (AHAR) Part 1 to Congress."
01/27/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-019.cfm,HUD Announces Landlord Incentives Cohort of 'Moving to Work' Demonstration,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) on Thursday announced the Landlord Incentives cohort of the expansion of the Moving to Work (MTW) Demonstration Program. Through this cohort, HUD will evaluate landlord incentives and their impact on participation in HUD's Housing Choice Voucher Program to improve residents' ability to use vouchers in their community.
""As Moving to Work marks 25 years, we are pleased to announce the latest cohort of local housing authorities that will join this program to test new housing strategies,"" said HUD Deputy Secretary Adrianne Todman. ""These agencies have put forth impressive plans to further support housing choices for people in their communities, including innovative ways to engage landlords, who are critical partners in delivering HUD's rental assistance program.""
This year marks the 25th anniversary of the MTW Demonstration Program. First authorized by Congress in 1996, MTW is a demonstration that provides public housing authorities (PHAs) the opportunity to redefine how they operate by giving them flexibility to try ""outside the box"" ideas that address community needs in innovative and creative ways. MTW allows PHAs the flexibility to create customized solutions to their community's specific challenges. With the addition of the 29 PHAs selected for this cohort, HUD will have added a total of 70 PHAs to the MTW Demonstration Program since January 2021. MTW PHAs are now in 38 states and the District of Columbia.
MTW encourages an entrepreneurial spirit to think of and create solutions in a new way. MTW agencies have directly influenced national policy for 25 years, paving the way for the future delivery of federally assisted housing. PHAs in the MTW demonstration have pioneered several innovative policy interventions that have been successful at the local level, and subsequently rolled out to the rest of the country's PHAs. Examples include requiring less frequent recertifications for those on a fixed income, increasing payment standards for the reasonable accommodation of persons with disabilities, and allowing the owners to maintain site-based waiting lists for project-based vouchers.
This latest cohort focused on landlord incentives continues this tradition of policy innovation benefiting residents of HUD-assisted housing. The expansion of MTW focuses primarily on small- and medium-sized PHAs that face administrative and policy challenges given their size and location.
The following PHAs were selected for the MTW Landlord Incentives cohort:
Interested PHAs will be able to apply to a future cohort in Spring 2022, when HUD will invite small- and medium-sized PHAs to apply to a cohort that will evaluate asset-building initiatives.
For more information about MTW and how it may benefit your local PHA, please go to www.hud.gov/MTW."
01/31/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-020.cfm,HUD Opens Access to More than $2 Billion in Federal Funds for Disaster Recovery and Mitigation,"WASHINGTON - The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today issued the Allocations for Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery and Implementation of the CDBG-DR Consolidated Waivers and Alternative Requirements Notice [""2020 CDBG-DR Notice""], a critical step taken by the department to open access to more than $2 billion in federal funds to help communities equitably recover and improve long-term resilience to disasters and future climate impacts.
HUD's Consolidated Notice, which lays out requirements for the use of these disaster recovery and mitigation funds, will require Community Development Block Grant-Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) grantees to incorporate disaster mitigation measures into all recovery activities involving construction and to advance equitable distribution of the disaster recovery assistance.
""As our nation continues to grapple with disasters ranging from hurricanes to wildfires, HUD is aware of the urgent need for equitable recovery and resilience,"" said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""HUD's consolidated notice ensures that climate justice and racial equity remain central in our work to deliver swift recovery and keep resiliency at the forefront. The Department looks forward to continuing to work with communities so that they can get their disaster recovery and mitigation funds as quickly as possible.""
Low-income residents and people of color often bear more of the impact when climate-related disasters strike. Responding to this fact, HUD's Consolidated Notice will accelerate community recovery and ensure that inclusive resilience and mitigation remain central to disaster recovery. Beyond the Consolidated Notice, HUD recognizes equitable resilience as a core component of its Climate Action Plan, an agency-wide strategy to advance climate adaptation and resilience, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and deliver environmental justice.
The Consolidated Notice applies to the more than $2 billion in CDBG-DR funds allocated by the Department in November 2021 and funds appropriated in the continuing resolution, the Extending Government Funding and Delivering Emergency Assistance Act (PL 117-43 (www.congress.gov/117/plaws/publ43/PLAW-117publ43.pdf); the Act), signed into law on September 30, 2021. That allocation was made to 10 states covering 15 separate major disasters that occurred calendar year 2020. A list of those states, allocations, and disasters covered is available here.
PL 117-43 appropriated a total of $5 billion in CDBG-DR funds with a focus on mitigation for major disasters that occurred in 2020 and 2021. Allocation of the remaining funds will be made over the next few months to address unmet needs from disasters occurring in 2021.
This announcement affirms HUD's commitment with the Biden-Harris Administration to ensure that our climate and equity goals for the nation are met through increasing resilience to the impacts of climate change; protecting public health; conserving lands, waters, and biodiversity; and spurring economic growth.
The CDBG-DR/MIT program is vital to building climate resilience in low- and moderate-income communities. The program, along with this consolidated notice, has a unique focus on long-term recovery and resilience efforts targeted towards underserved, and at-risk populations."

The parties executed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that enhances collaboration among Federal agencies and the Commonwealth, and kickstarts the PR100 Study (www.energy.gov/oe/puerto-rico-grid-resilience-and-transitions-100-renewable-energy-study-pr100). The PR100 Study is a community-driven and locally tailored roadmap to help the island meet its target of 100% renewable electricity, improve power sector resiliency and increase access to more affordable energy and cleaner air. Dozens of grid modernization projects will start construction this year, and Puerto Rico's utility will sign contracts for at least 2GW of renewable energy and 1GW of energy storage projects. The Biden-Harris Administration remains committed to helping states and territories reach their clean power targets to move the nation closer to achieving President Biden's 2050 goal of a net-zero carbon economy.
""Since day one of the Biden-Harris Administration, HUD has prioritized the recovery and resilience needs of Puerto Rico and we are pleased to join in this collaboration with our federal partners at DOE, DHS, and FEMA and with the government of Puerto Rico,"" said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""Together, we will improve the reliability and resilience of Puerto Rico's electrical system and help the island meet its renewable energy targets in a way that couples shorter-term recovery goals with forward-looking mitigation against natural disasters and the already evident impacts of a changing climate. As this MOU makes clear, the risks of climate change and the unprecedented federal investments provide an opportunity to improve the lives of individuals and communities across the nation through increased resilience and equity.""
""The Biden-Harris Administration is helping Puerto Rico strengthen the island's resilience, and in the process unlock its potential for cheap and abundant renewable energy,"" said Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. ""Today's commitments and the launch of the PR100 Study show that 2022 will be a year of action to modernize Puerto Rico's grid and increase energy resilience as we accelerate your work with Puerto Rico to execute data-driven, community-tailored pathways towards 100% clean electricity. DOE is proud to partner with Governor Pierluisi to help deliver a more reliable grid, good-paying jobs, lower utility bills, and healthier air to the more than 3 million American citizens living in Puerto Rico.""
""As Puerto Rico continues to rebuild and recover, we will work with our interagency partners to help create a more sustainable future and ensure communities have access to affordable energy and cleaner air,"" said Homeland Secretary Alejandro N. Mayorkas. ""This administration is making unprecedented investments in communities to help them adapt and become more resilient, and we will continue to provide the necessary resources to achieve these goals.""
""One of my top priorities as Governor of Puerto Rico since I took office has been to ensure that Puerto Rico's energy transformation moves forward at a steady and reliable pace. I will make sure that every federal fund appropriated to Puerto Rico and allocated for the reconstruction of the power grid is used efficiently and effectively,"" said Puerto Rico Governor Pedro Pierluisi. ""I thank the Biden Administration for partnering with us to help us achieve our main goal: transforming our energy system into a more resilient, reliable, affordable and clean one. Thank you, Secretaries Granholm, Fudge, Mayorkas and Administrator Criswell for entering this Memorandum of Understanding with my Administration. Your assistance will help ensure we keep moving forward in the transformation of the Island's electrical system.""
From emergency restoration to planning for the long-term recovery of Puerto Rico's energy sector, HUD, DOE, and DHS through FEMA, have been providing hands-on technical assistance to help Puerto Rico plan and prepare to execute over $12 billion in Federal recovery and grid modernization funds, efforts that are delivering concrete change in 2022:
First FEMA Permanent Work Projects Will Begin Construction - FEMA, the Central Office for Recovery, Reconstruction and Resilience (COR3), the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA), and LUMA Energy have established working groups and collaboration processes to reconstruct the island's electric grid. It is expected that at least 138 projects will be under construction bidding or have begun initial construction activities, including island-wide substation repairs, the replacement of thousands of streetlights across five municipalities, and the creation of an early warning system to improve dam safety. Clean Energy Projects Will Move Toward Construction - To achieve its clean energy goals, Puerto Rico is procuring 3750MW of renewable energy and 1500MW of energy storage, enough clean energy to power over 1 million homes. Over the last year, DOE has provided technical assistance to the Government of Puerto Rico to align the procurement process with global best practices and ensure access to capital, to ultimately lower electricity costs for ratepayers who currently pay twice the national average. PREPA is currently in final negotiations of the first tranche of proposed projects: 844 MW of renewable energy, 220 MW of energy storage, and two Virtual Power Plants. Implementation of $1.9 billion in HUD grant funding for electrical power system improvements and enhancements - In 2022, the Puerto Rico Department of Housing (PRDOH) will implement an action plan to enhance electrical system reliability and resilience. Puerto Rico's proposed plan includes the development of both small and large microgrids. The action plan, funded through HUD's Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) disaster recovery program and developed with assistance from DOE, focuses community investments on vulnerable populations and low-and moderate -income households. Emergency Preparedness Tool Will Launch Ahead of the 2022 Hurricane Season - DOE and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) are developing a tool that will combine detailed models of the Puerto Rico electric system with hurricane forecasting to help the Government of Puerto Rico better prepare in the days leading up to a hurricane in order to accelerate the immediate response and save lives. This tool is being developed specifically for Puerto Rico in close partnership with the utility.
• First FEMA Permanent Work Projects Will Begin Construction - FEMA, the Central Office for Recovery, Reconstruction and Resilience (COR3), the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA), and LUMA Energy have established working groups and collaboration processes to reconstruct the island's electric grid. It is expected that at least 138 projects will be under construction bidding or have begun initial construction activities, including island-wide substation repairs, the replacement of thousands of streetlights across five municipalities, and the creation of an early warning system to improve dam safety.
• Clean Energy Projects Will Move Toward Construction - To achieve its clean energy goals, Puerto Rico is procuring 3750MW of renewable energy and 1500MW of energy storage, enough clean energy to power over 1 million homes. Over the last year, DOE has provided technical assistance to the Government of Puerto Rico to align the procurement process with global best practices and ensure access to capital, to ultimately lower electricity costs for ratepayers who currently pay twice the national average. PREPA is currently in final negotiations of the first tranche of proposed projects: 844 MW of renewable energy, 220 MW of energy storage, and two Virtual Power Plants.
• Implementation of $1.9 billion in HUD grant funding for electrical power system improvements and enhancements - In 2022, the Puerto Rico Department of Housing (PRDOH) will implement an action plan to enhance electrical system reliability and resilience. Puerto Rico's proposed plan includes the development of both small and large microgrids. The action plan, funded through HUD's Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) disaster recovery program and developed with assistance from DOE, focuses community investments on vulnerable populations and low-and moderate -income households.

This tool is being developed specifically for Puerto Rico in close partnership with the utility.
As dozens of new energy recovery projects move rapidly towards construction, DOE is leveraging the world-class expertise and advanced modeling capabilities of its National Labs with the launch of the Puerto Rico Grid Resilience and Transition to 100% Renewable Energy (PR100) Study, designed to ensure that funded energy recovery actions align with Puerto Rico energy policy and resilience needs, are coordinated across sectors, and align with industry best practices. Led by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), the study will connect local decisionmakers and communities with tools, training, and analytical support to enable planning and operation of the Commonwealth's power grid with greater resilience against disruption as it moves toward its 100% renewable energy goal.
Specifically, the PR100 Study will:
Engage stakeholders and assess climate risks through the lens of energy justice -- Extensive community engagement will inform the development of scenarios that reflect local perspectives and priorities to meet the Commonwealth's goal of 100% renewable energy by 2050. Energy justice considerations and climate risk assessments will be incorporated into the study's modeling efforts. Assess the full potential of renewable energy -- Generation of high-quality input data such as resource potential, detailed demand projections, and distributed energy resource adoption will inform scenario generation and modeling. Model clean energy scenarios -- Based on stakeholder input and data, the research team will select detailed feasible pathways to 100% renewable energy, and then model their potential to meet resilience, reliability, affordability, and safety objectives. Analyze system reliability, resilience, and economic impact -- Analysis of the implications of 100% renewable electricity on the power system and associated economic and workforce development will be evaluated and incorporated into the final deliverables.

The PR100 Study is funded by FEMA through an interagency agreement with DOE's Office of Electricity to support recovery efforts in the island's energy sector leveraging the expertise and capabilities of the National Laboratories including Argonne, Lawrence Berkeley, NREL, Oak Ridge, PNNL, and Sandia. The PR100 Study is modeled after the Los Angeles ""100% Renewable Energy Study"" (LA100), which evaluated a wide range of future scenarios to help Los Angeles understand options for and implications of meeting its renewable energy goals. Study results showed that meeting Los Angeles' goal of reliable, 100% renewable electricity by 2045-or even 2035-is achievable, and will provide benefits related to air quality, greenhouse gas emissions, and public health if coupled with electrification of other sectors.
""Working in collaboration with a local advisory stakeholder group and led by the DOE's National Renewable Energy Lab , the Los Angeles 100% Renewable Energy Study (LA100) was an unprecedented, independent effort that confirmed LA can reliably achieve a 100% carbon-free grid,"" said Reiko Kerr, Los Angeles Department of Water and Power Senior Assistant General Manager of Power System Engineering and Technical Services. ""We are very proud that our partnership with DOE has helped create a model that other communities can replicate for their path to a 100% renewable and decarbonized energy future.""
DOE will hold a public informational webinar on February 16 at 12:00 pm A.T. to offer additional details. Visit this event page to learn more and register for the event (www.energy.gov/oe/launch-event-puerto-rico-grid-resilience-and-transition-100-renewable-energy-study-pr100)."
02/04/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-022.cfm,HUD Releases 2021 Annual Homeless Assessment Report Part 1,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today released its 2021 Annual Homeless Assessment Report Part 1 to Congress (www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/ahar/2021-ahar-part-1-pit-estimates-of-homelessness-in-the-us.html). The report found that more than 326,000 people experienced sheltered homelessness in the United States on a single night in 2021, a decrease of eight percent, from 2020.
""Sheltered homelessness"" refers to people experiencing homelessness who were found in emergency shelters, transitional housing, or other temporary settings. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, HUD waived the requirement for communities to conduct the count of unsheltered homelessness in 2021. In January 2021, 138 communities, 36 percent of all communities, conducted full unsheltered counts and an additional 72 communities conducted a partial count, in which total unsheltered counts were reported but not household or demographic characteristics. Therefore, 2021 AHAR Report Part 1 is only able to provide national estimates on sheltered homelessness and findings on unsheltered homelessness only from the communities that conducted unsheltered counts.
The report found that the number of sheltered people in families with children declined considerably between 2020 and 2021, while the number of sheltered individuals remained relatively flat. Between 2020 and 2021, the number of veterans experiencing sheltered homelessness decreased by 10 percent. On a single night in 2021, 15,763 people under the age of 25 experienced sheltered homelessness on their own as ""unaccompanied youth."" The number of sheltered individuals with chronic patterns of homelessness increased by 20 percent between 2020 and 2021.
""The findings of the 2021 AHAR Part 1 report suggest that federal COVID-19 relief had positive impacts on sheltered homelessness,"" said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""Yet we know that homelessness in America remains an urgent crisis. As long as people in this nation continue to lack affordable, secure housing, our work to put Housing First is not done. By continuing to leverage American Rescue Plan resources and our federal House America initiative, the Administration will further accelerate progress toward our shared goal of ending the homelessness crisis.""
""The 10% decline in sheltered homelessness among Veterans between January 2020 and January 2021 suggests that the measures put in place to protect our most vulnerable Veterans and keep them in stable housing during the pandemic and beyond have had encouraging impacts,"" said VA Secretary Denis McDonough. ""VA remains committed to actively working with our federal, local and non-profit partners to sustain existing and implement new evidence-based programs and policies to permanently house or rapidly re-house Veterans who are experiencing or at risk of homelessness because every Veteran has earned and deserves a safe place to call home.""
The pandemic also resulted in considerable changes to the practices of homeless service providers. To promote the safety of people staying in shelter programs, most emergency shelters reduced occupancy to respond to CDC recommendations on COVID-19 safety measures. In some cases, this reduced occupancy was reported through the Housing Inventory Count (HIC), but in other communities it was not. Estimates of the number of people experiencing sheltered homelessness at a point in time in 2021 should be viewed with caution, as the number could be artificially depressed compared with non-pandemic times, reflecting reduced occupancy in some communities or safety concerns regarding staying in shelters.
HUD releases the Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress (AHAR) in two parts. Part 1 provides Point-in-Time (PIT) estimates, offering a snapshot of homelessness on a single night. The one-night counts are conducted during the last 10 days of January each year, with extensions approved on a case-by-case basis. The PIT counts also provide an estimate of the number of people experiencing homelessness within particular homeless populations such as individuals with chronic patterns of homelessness and veterans experiencing homelessness.
The Point-in-Time counts of homelessness and the housing inventory information are based on data from January 2021 and thus do not reflect the full impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the prevalence of homelessness or the health and economic status of people experiencing homelessness.
Key Findings of HUD's 2021 Annual Homeless Assessment Report Part 1:
On a single night in 2021, more than 326,000 people were experiencing sheltered homelessness in the United States. Six in ten were individuals—that is, people in households with only adults or in households with only children. Four in ten were people in families with children. The number of people staying in sheltered locations decreased by eight percent between 2020 and 2021. While this continues a decline that began in 2015, the drop between 2020 and 2021 was steeper than those in recent years. The number of sheltered people in families with children declined considerably between 2020 and 2021, while the number of sheltered individuals remained relatively flat. Between 2020 and 2021, the reported inventory available for people experiencing homelessness remained relatively flat, but occupancy rates declined. The share of emergency shelter beds for people experiencing sheltered homelessness located in non-congregate settings increased by 134 percent. Between 2020 and 2021, the number of veterans experiencing sheltered homelessness decreased by 10 percent. This represents the largest one-year decline since 2015-2016. On a single night in 2021, 15,763 people under the age of 25 experienced sheltered homelessness on their own as ""unaccompanied youth."" This represents a decline of nine percent between 2020 and 2021. While decreases in sheltered homelessness among unaccompanied youth were experienced across nearly all demographic characteristics, a few groups did experience increases. The number of sheltered individuals with chronic patterns of homelessness increased by 20 percent between 2020 and 2021.

Sheltered Homelessness
In January of 2021, 326,126 people were experiencing sheltered homelessness, staying in emergency shelters, safe havens, or transitional housing programs. While sheltered homelessness had been decreasing in recent years, the decline between January of 2020, before the onset of the pandemic in the United States, and January of 2021 was steeper than recent year to year declines. The number of people staying in sheltered locations declined by 8 percent (or 28,260 people). The sheltered population reported in 2021 was 19 percent lower than it was in 2010 and 17 percent lower than it was in 2007, when these data were first reported.
Sheltered Chronic Homelessness
The number of sheltered individuals with chronic patterns of homelessness increased by 20 percent between 2020 and 2021. This trend in the sheltered chronically homeless individual population runs counter to the decrease for all sheltered individuals. While the overall sheltered individual population has declined, the number of chronically homeless individuals staying in shelter programs has increased in recent years and continued to do so between 2020 and 2021.
Sheltered Family Homelessness
On a single night in 2021, 131,377 people experienced sheltered homelessness as part of a family with at least one adult and one child under the age of 18. The average family size was 3.2 people, and about 41,000 family households were experiencing sheltered homelessness. The overall number of people in families with children who were experiencing sheltered homelessness on a single night declined by 15 percent between 2020 and 2021 (or 23,531 fewer people). This was a much larger change than in the number of sheltered individuals, which dropped by only 2 percent. Some of the pandemic-related resources available through the CARES Act and other pandemic relief measures were more generous to families with children.
Sheltered Youth Homelessness
On a single night in 2021, 15,763 people under the age of 25 experienced sheltered homelessness on their own as ""unaccompanied youth."" This represents a decline of nine percent between 2020 and 2021. While decreases in sheltered homelessness among unaccompanied youth were experienced across nearly all demographic characteristics, a few groups did experience increases. The number of people who were transgender increased by 29 percent, and the number of sheltered unaccompanied youth who were gender non-conforming increased by 26 percent. Though the number was relatively small, sheltered unaccompanied youth who were Native American experienced the largest percentage increase, at 21 percent.
Sheltered Veteran Homelessness
Between 2020 and 2021, the number of veterans experiencing sheltered homelessness decreased by 10 percent. This represents the largest one-year decline since 2015 to 2016. In 2021, 19,750 veterans were experiencing sheltered homelessness, representing eight percent of all sheltered adults experiencing homelessness in the United States. Veterans experiencing sheltered homelessness accounted for 11 out of every 10,000 veterans in the country.
Sheltered Homelessness Among People of Color
More than 4 of every 10 people experiencing sheltered homelessness were Black of African American (45% or 147,521), and 44 percent (or 144,707 people) were White. The remaining 10 percent were people identifying multiple races (5%), Native American or Indigenous Peoples (2%), Asian (1%), or Pacific Islander (1%). Between 2020 and 2021, the number of Black or African American people staying in shelters decreased by 12 percent. People who were of more than one race decreased by 10 percent. While the number was relatively small, the number of people who were Pacific Islander increased by 10 percent (or 421 people).
Unsheltered Homelessness
In the sample of 138 communities that conducted full unsheltered counts in both 2020 and 2021, nearly half of people experiencing homelessness (46%) were individuals staying in sheltered locations, 37 percent were people in families with children staying in sheltered locations, 15 percent were unsheltered individuals, and three percent were unsheltered people in families with children. Across all 138 communities, the unsheltered population remained largely unchanged, decreasing by 78 people or less than one percent. The number of people counted in unsheltered locations increased in rural and other largely urban CoCs and decreased in major cities and suburbs. The change in the number of unsheltered individuals mirrored that of all unsheltered people. However, in each geographic category the number of unsheltered people in families increased."
02/08/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-023.cfm,HUD Approves Agreement with Las Vegas Housing Providers Resolving Claims of Disability Discrimination,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has approved a Conciliation Agreement with Las Vegas landlord, Anwar Malik, and Malik's property manager, Ahmad Sharif-Yazdi, to resolve allegations of discrimination brought by a prospective tenant with a disability. The Agreement resolves allegations that Malik and the property manager discriminated against the prospective tenant by refusing to rent a property to her because she had an assistance animal. Read the Agreement.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from discriminating against persons with disabilities, including refusing to make reasonable accommodations in policies or practices when such accommodations may be necessary to provide them an equal opportunity to use or enjoy a dwelling. Housing providers may not prohibit people with disabilities from having assistance animals that perform work or tasks or that provide disability-related emotional support.
""Not only is it cruel to deny a person with disabilities access to housing because they have a service animal, but it is also against the law,"" said Demetria L. McCain, HUD's Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""This settlement demonstrates HUD's commitment to protecting the housing rights of persons with disabilities and ensuring they have the support they need to live in the housing of their choice.""
The case came to HUD's attention when a prospective tenant filed a fair housing complaint alleging that she was denied the opportunity to rent a house because she had a dog who served as her assistance animal. The complainant alleged that after the lease was signed, the owner and manager learned that she had an assistance animal and refused to rent the house to her because of the dog.
Under the Agreement, the owner will pay $6,500 to the prospective tenant, and both the owner and property manager will attend fair housing training and comply with fair housing requirements for reasonable accommodations.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 877-8339 (Relay). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to hud.gov/fairhousing. For more information about assistance animals under the Fair Housing Act, please click here."
02/09/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-024.cfm,HUD Applauds Actions to Ensure that the Maintenance and Marketing of Real Estate Owned Portfolio Aligns with Fair Housing and Civil Rights Requirements,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) on Wednesday applauded the recent settlements between Fannie Mae, the National Fair Housing Alliance, and local fair housing organizations. Grants from HUD supported the investigation into potential disparities in the maintenance and marketing of Real Estate Owned (REO) properties.
""It is our hope that settlement of these cases will bring about much needed positive outcomes for these undeserved communities,"" said Demetria L. McCain, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (FHEO). ""We also hope mortgage lenders across the country will take steps to avoid fair housing violations in their own REO portfolios.""
HUD strongly supports work to eliminate housing discrimination, promote economic opportunity, and achieve diverse, inclusive communities by leading the nation in the enforcement, administration, development, and public understanding of federal fair housing policies and laws. FHEO's administration of grants to local fair organizations, which conduct investigations and fair housing education and outreach, assists in fulfilling this mission.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in the sale, rental, and financing of dwellings, and in other housing-related transactions, based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex (including gender identity and sexual orientation), familial status, and disability. FHEO is available to assist people who believe they have experienced housing discrimination. If you think your rights have been violated, you should file a fair housing complaint with HUD. You can file a complaint by calling HUD at 1-800-669-9777 or visiting How to File a Complaint on HUD's website. Materials and assistance are available for persons with limited English proficiency. Individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing may contact the Department using the Federal Relay Service at 1-800-877-8339. You should file a complaint with HUD as soon as possible. HUD may not be able to help you if your complaint is filed more than one year after the last discriminatory act. You may also be able to file a complaint with a state or local fair housing agency. A list of the state and local fair housing agencies funded by HUD is available on HUD's website here."
02/14/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-025.cfm,Federal Housing Administration Removes Temporary COVID-19 Underwriting Mitigants for Multifamily Transactions,"WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) announced on Monday at the Mortgage Bankers Association Commercial/Multifamily Finance Convention & Expo that it is removing temporary COVID-19 underwriting mitigants for multifamily transactions insured under Section 223(f) of the National Housing Act, effective immediately for all insured transactions that have yet to reach endorsement. The temporary requirements for nine months of debt service reserves, 250 percent repair escrows, and limits on cash-out refinance transactions were originally put in place in April 2020 to counter-balance potential financial effects resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. In the almost two years following implementation of the policies, the FHA Multifamily portfolio has proven to be consistently resilient to significant COVID-19 impacts, remaining at a less than one-percent default rate.
""Through actions taken under the Biden-Harris Administration to help the nation recover from the pandemic, including the historic American Rescue Plan, mortgages in FHA's Multifamily insurance portfolio experienced fewer challenges than expected,"" said Lopa Kolluri, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Office of Housing and FHA. ""Because of this, we are in a position to unleash multifamily development capital by lifting these underwriting safeguards.""
This change allows lenders to return to using standard Multifamily Accelerated Processing (MAP) Guide policies going forward, which require fewer capital reserves to be held for debt service, a lower percentage of capital to be held in repair escrows, and more flexible requirements for the treatment of cash-out refinance transactions.
""FHA multifamily mortgage insurance helps to create much-needed rental homes in communities nationwide,"" said Ethan Handelman, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Multifamily Housing. ""Returning to our normal underwriting safeguards will put more capital to work for affordable housing.""
About the Multifamily Accelerated Processing Guide The Multifamily Accelerated Processing (MAP) Guide contains comprehensive instruction and requirements for the origination, underwriting and endorsement of FHA-insured mortgages for multifamily properties. Access the MAP Guide online.
About the FHA Multifamily Mortgage Insurance Program FHA's Office of Multifamily Housing plays an important role in the construction, substantial rehabilitation and refinance of market rate and affordable housing through the issuance of FHA mortgage insurance. These insurance programs provide stability, liquidity, and affordability to the multifamily housing market by providing credit during countercyclical times and in small markets. In fiscal year 2021, the Office of Multifamily Housing achieved record-breaking volume of $29.5 billion in endorsements for mortgage insurance for more than 1,500 multifamily mortgages.

02/23/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-028.cfm,"HUD Closes Rental Assistance Demonstration Transaction with the Housing Authority of the City of Wilson, North Carolina, to Build 32 New Construction Affordable Rental Homes to Relocate People Impacted by Hurricane Matthew","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Office of Multifamily Housing on February 16 closed on a Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) transaction, Eatmon Townhomes in the Whitfield Homes Community, with the Housing Authority of the City of Wilson in Wilson, North Carolina. This transaction will enable the Housing Authority to ensure that 32 assisted housing units in an area that has flooded multiple times in the last four years are relocated out of a flood zone.
The State of North Carolina identified moving public housing out of the 100-year flood hazard area as a key component of its Rebuild North Carolina plan developed in the aftermath of Hurricane Matthew. The State of North Carolina awarded the Wilson Housing Authority a Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) grant and a CDBG Neighborhood Revitalization grant to assist in the development of these relocated homes.
In addition to reducing the risk of future hazards on residents of these homes, the site where the 32 new two-bedroom affordable housing units will be built, 500 Walnut Street, is also centrally located near the Wilson Downtown Redevelopment District, ensuring they have improved access to community amenities in downtown Wilson. The original site of the public housing units, Hominy Swamp Creek, will be redeveloped as a greenway and flood retention zone.
All of the newly constructed units will be energy-efficient, including Energy Star appliances and features, and four of these units will be constructed to ensure that they comply with the Federal Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards, in order to be safe, accessible and usable by people of all ages and abilities.
The RAD transaction includes a construction budget of $5.1 million ($162,000 per unit) fully financed through several sources:
Community Development Block Grants (CDBG- Disaster Recovery Grant and a CDBG-Neighborhood Revitalization Grant) Public Housing Operating Reserves and Capital Funds Public Housing Demolition/Disposition Transitional Funding
• Community Development Block Grants (CDBG- Disaster Recovery Grant and a CDBG-Neighborhood Revitalization Grant)
• Public Housing Operating Reserves and Capital Funds
• Public Housing Demolition/Disposition Transitional Funding
About RAD
RAD was designed to help address the multi-billion-dollar nationwide backlog of deferred maintenance in the public housing portfolio and to stem the loss of affordable housing that could no longer be kept to decent standards. From the program's inception through February 1, 2022, the Rental Assistance Demonstration has facilitated more than $13.5 billion in capital investment to improve or replace nearly 175,000 deeply rent-assisted homes, most of which house extremely low-income families, seniors, and persons with disabilities.
Under RAD, converted homes are moved to the Section 8 platform with a long-term contract that, by law, must be renewed in perpetuity. Under Section 8, residents continue to pay 30% of their income towards rent and the housing must continue to serve those with very low and extremely low incomes, as was the case when the property was assisted through the public housing program. Residents must be notified and consulted prior to conversion, are given a right to return to assisted housing post-construction so that the same tenants can enjoy these newly preserved and improved apartments and maintain the same fundamental rights they had as public housing residents.

02/24/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-029.cfm,Statement from Secretary Marcia L. Fudge on Black Homeownership Remaining Lower Than a Decade Ago Despite the U.S. Homeownership Rate Experiencing Largest Annual Increase on Record,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia L. Fudge on Thursday released the following statement on the National Association of Realtors®' (NAR) 2022 Snapshot of Race and Home Buying in America (www.nar.realtor/research-and-statistics/research-reports/a-snapshot-of-race-and-home-buying-in-america) report, which examines current racial disparities in the housing market.
""Today, homeownership is the principal source of wealth creation for most American households. Unfortunately, NAR's report confirms that Black Americans are being locked out of homeownership opportunities at an even higher rate than a decade ago. It is critical that we bridge the racial homeownership gap with intentional solutions that recognize both the persistent history of discrimination and inequity, and the current crisis of housing affordability. We must recognize that Black Americans are more likely to carry student loan debt and have higher balances. Black Americans are also more likely to experience discrimination in the housing market.
""At HUD, we are meeting this challenge in a number of ways including taking steps to make homeownership more accessible to those with student loan debt; tackling bias in the homebuying process; and making it clear that certain Special Purpose Credit Programs are lawful and are an important tool to help expand access to credit and homeownership for those who have experienced systemic and generational exclusion. The Biden-Harris Administration and HUD will continue to prioritize opening the door to homeownership for families—especially those who have been systemically kept out over generations.""
According to NAR's report, the U.S. homeownership rate climbed to 65.5% in 2020, up 1.3% from 2019 and the largest annual increase on record. More Americans own homes now than during any year following the Great Recession (65.4% homeownership rate in 2010). However, Black Americans continue to face significant obstacles along the path to homeownership. The homeownership rate for Black Americans – 43.4% – trails behind that of a decade ago (44.2% in 2010). Conversely, White Americans (72.1%), Asian Americans (61.7%) and Hispanic Americans (51.1%) all achieved decade long highs in homeownership in 2020, with the rate for Hispanic Americans setting a record and reaching above 50% for the first time.
Under Secretary Fudge, HUD has taken a number of proactive steps to redress the impact of past discriminatory practices and implement new policies to help more families—particularly African Americans—realize the dream of homeownership:
Removed Barriers to Homeownership for Those with Student Loan Debt. The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) updated its policy on student loan monthly payment calculations to remove barriers and provide more access to affordable single-family FHA-insured mortgage financing for creditworthy individuals with student loan debt, which has disproportionate impact on communities of color. The updates removed the previous requirement that lenders calculate a borrower's student loan monthly payment of one percent of the outstanding student loan balance for student loans that are not fully amortizing. The new policy bases the monthly payment on the actual student loan payment, more closely aligning FHA policies with industry standards.
Advanced Fair Housing. More than 50 years since the Fair Housing Act's passage, access to wealth through homeownership remains persistently unequal. In his first week in office, President Biden issued a memorandum directing HUD to address discrimination in the housing market. Secretary Fudge is taking critical steps towards realizing the President's directive. HUD has published both its proposed rule on countering housing practices with discriminatory effects and its interim final rule on the legal duty to Affirmatively Further Fair Housing in the Federal Register. These rules will align federal enforcement practice with the Fair Housing Act's broad remedial purpose to end discrimination in housing. Together, they will provide the legal framework for HUD to require private and public entities alike to rethink established practices that contribute to or perpetuate systemic inequality in housing and recognize and address longstanding fair housing issues in our communities.
Improved Homebuyer Assistance Programs. The President's FY2022 HUD budget proposal makes clear that housing is foundational to building a strong, more secure America. The FY2022 HUD budget includes a $100 million set-aside for Secretary Fudge's new initiative, the FirstHOME Homebuyer Assistance initiative, which provides funding to States and insular areas – unincorporated territories of the United States – to support sustainable homeownership.
Took Action to Address Racial Bias in the Housing Market. On June 1st, 2021 in Tulsa, President Biden announced that Secretary Fudge would lead a first-of-its-kind interagency initiative to address inequity in home appraisals. Along with Domestic Policy Advisor Ambassador Susan Rice, Secretary Fudge launched the first interagency task force on Property Appraisal and Valuation Equity (PAVE). The effort is utilizing, quickly, the many levers at the federal government's disposal to root out discrimination in the appraisal and homebuying process. A 2018 Brookings study (www.brookings.edu/research/devaluation-of-assets-in-black-neighborhoods/) found that homes in majority-Black neighborhoods are often valued at tens of thousands of dollars less than comparable homes in similar-but majority-White-communities. And the crisis is worsening: a recent study (www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-21/race-gap-in-home-appraisals-has-doubled-since-1980?sref=A1Z2GUXp) found that the gap between the appraised value of homes in predominantly White neighborhoods compared to comparable homes in predominantly Black and Latino neighborhoods nearly doubled between 1980 and 2015.
Called for Tools to Expand Access to Credit and Homeownership. As Congress recognized in specifically authorizing Special Purpose Credit Programs (SPCPs) in an amendment to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) in 1976, SPCPs can be an important tool to help expand access to credit and homeownership for those who have experienced systemic and generational exclusion. Despite SPCPs' being specifically authorized under ECOA, for too long banks have expressed reticence to establish these programs, some citing concerns that the Fair Housing Act somehow bars what ECOA explicitly permits. HUD issued a legal opinion making it clear that certain SPCPs that are lawful under ECOA generally are not barred by the Fair Housing Act. Secretary Fudge has also convened partner agencies to discuss the furtherance of homeownership and credit availability for communities who have long been denied such opportunities.
Awarded Grants to Support Free and Low-Cost Housing Counseling. In January, HUD awarded $51.4 million in housing counseling grants to 177 HUD-approved housing counseling agencies and intermediary organizations. This included funding to HUD-approved housing counseling agencies that are partnering with Historically Black College and Universities (HBCUs), Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs), or other Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs). The funding will support housing counseling agencies in their work to help families make more informed housing choices. The awards also include funding to further training and education to attract and retain more diverse housing counseling professionals.
Awarded Grants to Support Asset Building Among HUD-Assisted Families. Recently, HUD awarded $101 million to 677 public housing authorities (PHAs) to support efforts to help residents living in public housing and those participating in the Department's Housing Choice Voucher Program to meet their financial goals through HUD's Family Self-Sufficiency (FSS) Program. Participants in the program have an interest-bearing escrow account established for them. Upon successful graduation, the household receives the escrow funds to advance their personal financial goals, including improving their credit score or making a down payment on a home."

The mortgage will be used to refinance this age-restricted project that includes 203 rental apartments restricted to households for low-income seniors (55+ years) earning between 30% and 60% of area median income (AMI). There is an existing Rental Covenant and Agreement with the City of Los Angeles. The agreement provided a bonus density resulting in 203 apartment units, a parking reduction variance, and 41 units restricted to low-income seniors (ages 55 and older) earning 60% of the AMI.
The mortgage was originated by ORIX Real Estate Capital LLC, Pavilion Park Plaza, L.P. The Sponsor is 21 Alpha Group.

02/24/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-035.cfm,HUD and Census Bureau Report New Residential Sales in January 2022,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Census Bureau jointly announced the following new residential sales statistics for January 2022:

New Home Sales Sales of new single-family houses in January 2022 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 801,000, according to estimates released jointly today by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. This is 4.5 2percent (±16.2 percent)* above the revised December rate of 839,000 and is 19.3 percent (±15. percent)* below the January 2021 estimate of 993,000.
Sales Price The median sales price of new houses sold in January 2022 was $423,300. The average sales price was $496,000.
For Sale Inventory and Months' Supply The seasonally-adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of January was 406,000. This represents a supply of 6.1 months at the current sales rate.

EXPLANATORY NOTES
These statistics are estimated from sample surveys. They are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated average relative standard errors of the preliminary data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. Changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show irregular movement. It takes 4 months to establish a trend for new houses sold. Preliminary new home sales figures are subject to revision due to the survey methodology and definitions used. The survey is primarily based on a sample of houses selected from building permits. Since a ""sale"" is defined as a deposit taken or sales agreement signed, this can occur prior to a permit being issued. An estimate of these prior sales is included in the sales figure. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimate of total sales is revised about 4.6 percent. Changes in sales price data reflect changes in the distribution of houses by region, size, etc., as well as changes in the prices of houses with identical characteristics. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau's website (www.census.gov/construction/nrs/how_the_data_are_collected/index.html).
* The 90 percent confidence interval includes zero. In such cases, there is insufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero."
02/28/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-033.cfm,HUD Secretary Fudge Joins DOE Secretary Granholm to Announce Better Climate Challenge,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Marcia L. Fudge joined Department of Energy (DOE) Secretary Jennifer M. Granholm and White House National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy to announce the inaugural Better Climate Challenge, a private-public partnership led by DOE with over 80 American businesses and organizations that have signed on to ambitious carbon reduction goals. The Better Climate Challenge also encourages partners to share pathways to decarbonization among each other to multiply the impact of their innovative strategies to decarbonize.
HUD supports the multifamily component of the Better Climate Challenge, one of several building sectors participating in the Challenge.
""The Challenge is not just about cutting carbon pollution but about supporting communities that all too often bear the brunt of climate change while seeing too few of the benefits from the energy transition,"" said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""We have a tremendous opportunity to deliver climate justice to disadvantaged communities, lower energy expenses in affordable housing, and accelerate mitigation efforts to protect at-risk communities from natural disasters and the impacts of climate change. That is why I'm pleased that of the organizations stepping up to this challenge, seven are public housing and multifamily partners, representing a bright future for more than 40,000 families. We are delighted to partner with DOE on this initiative and look forward to our continued work together.""
""Companies across America are joining arms to lead the zero-carbon transition through smart, strategic climate solutions that slash building and factory emissions and significantly cut costs,"" said Energy Secretary Jennifer M. Granholm. ""With the help of DOE, the meaningful and measurable emissions reductions of the Better Climate Challenge will save American businesses billions of dollars, create good-paying jobs, and drive innovation that strengthens the entire U.S. economy.""
""The bold climate goals of the Better Climate Challenge will foster cutting-edge innovation and help American businesses decarbonize a crucial sector while they reap the benefits of investing in cleaner, cheaper, and more sustainable energy,"" said White House Climate Advisory Gina McCarthy. ""These commitments harness the collective power of American businesses to carve new pathways to emissions reductions and accelerate progress towards deploying climate solutions across the country and reaching our zero-emissions goals.""
The Better Climate Challenge (https://betterbuildingssolutioncenter.energy.gov/better-climate-challenge) is a voluntary, market-based platform for organizations to come together and put in place ambitious, portfolio-wide, operational greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction goals and showcase how they are taking necessary, measurable steps to address the impacts of climate change.
Of the more than 80 inaugural partners who have committed to the Challenge, seven are public housing or multifamily partners serving 40,000 low-and moderate-income households across the country: Community Housing Partners, Foundation Communities, Homeowner's Rehab, King County Housing Authority, Seattle Housing Authority, Standard Communities, and the Tenderloin Neighborhood Development Corporation.
This challenge builds on the existing Better Building Challenge (www.hudexchange.info/programs/better-buildings-multifamily-initiative/), which HUD supports with Community Compass technical assistance (TA). Unlike the Better Building Challenge's requirement for a commitment to a 20 percent improvement in energy efficiency, the Climate Challenge will request commitments of a 50 percent portfolio-wide reduction in carbon emissions over 10 years.
Any organization with a portfolio of a minimum of two multifamily buildings and 250 units in the nation is welcome to join the multifamily Better Climate Challenge. Through this Challenge, DOE and HUD are striving to work with organizations across the U.S. economy to ensure broad participation and highlight leadership from a diverse array of public and private organizations across geographies.
The program builds upon the success of the Better Buildings, Better Plants Challenge and provides value to partnering organizations in the following ways:
Engage in Market Transformation with Industry Leaders Access a network of more than 950 organizations in DOE's Better Buildings Initiative across every building sector to develop innovative cost-effective GHG reduction solutions.

Union Square is located in the Union Miles neighborhood of Cleveland, approximately 4.5 miles from downtown. Developed in 1972 on 1.32 acres of land, it consists of one nine-story building that has a preference for elderly tenants 55 years of age and older. The common amenities include elevators, a recreation/meeting room, laundry facility, a billiards room and parking.
The initial construction work will consist of renovations to the kitchens and bathrooms, installing safer electrical outlets as well as improving ADA accessibility on-site. Additionally, CMHA will be replacing sliding doors and making certain repairs to units that have had water damage and giving the property a complete facade repair.
Post-conversion, the property will be transferred to a single asset Limited Liability Company that will be a wholly owned entity of CMHA. The newly formed ownership will lease the land and the buildings from CMHA through a 75-year ground lease. Post-conversion, CMHA will continue to manage the property.
The RAD transaction includes a construction budget of $1.3 million ($7,500 per unit) and a $1.1 million initial deposit to replacement reserve contribution, which will be fully financed through a FHA 223(f) first mortgage loan.
About RAD
RAD was designed to help address the multi-billion-dollar nationwide backlog of deferred maintenance in the public housing portfolio and to stem the loss of affordable housing that could no longer be kept to decent standards. From the program's inception through February 1, 2022, the Rental Assistance Demonstration has facilitated more than $13.5 billion in capital investment to improve or replace nearly 175,000 deeply rent-assisted homes, most of which house extremely low-income families, seniors, and persons with disabilities.
Under RAD, converted homes are moved to the Section 8 platform with a long-term contract that, by law, must be renewed in perpetuity. Under Section 8, residents continue to pay 30% of their income towards rent and the housing must continue to serve those with very low and extremely low incomes, as was the case when the property was assisted through the public housing program. Residents must be notified and consulted prior to conversion, are given a right to return to assisted housing post-construction so that the same tenants can enjoy these newly preserved and improved apartments and maintain the same fundamental rights they had as public housing residents.

This fourth round of ICDBG-ARP awards underscores HUD and the Biden-Harris Administration's commitment to delivering equitable relief to Tribal communities.
A breakdown of the awards by recipients is available here.
""With these new grants, HUD continues to deliver equitable relief to Tribal communities,"" said HUD Deputy Secretary Adrianne Todman. ""Tribes have experienced years of underinvestment and face significant backlogs of unmet needs, and these funds show what is possible when Tribes are provided with additional resources. HUD and the Biden-Harris Administration remain committed to strengthening relations with Tribal nations to ensure that all communities are securing the opportunity of a healthy home and community.""
These ICDBG-ARP funds will help Tribes protect the health and safety of their communities. These funds especially benefit low- and moderate-income individuals and families and aim to prevent, prepare for, and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic through funding eligible activities such as housing construction and rehabilitation, and water infrastructure.
HUD staff announced the ICDBG-ARP round 4 awards during a press briefing on the one-year anniversary of the American Rescue Plan.
With today's awards, HUD has now awarded nearly $280 million in ICDBG-ARP grants across 240 Tribes. Today's announcement follows HUD's previous awards of $83 million in ICDBG-ARP grants to 74 Tribal communities in January 2022, $52 million in ICDBG-ARP grants to 49 Tribal communities in December 2021, and $74 million in ICDBG-ARP grants to 68 Tribal communities in November 2021. The American Rescue Plan included a total of $280 million for the Indian Community Block Grant program.
HUD and the Biden-Harris Administration have prioritized delivering equitable COVID-19 relief to Tribal communities. The American Rescue Plan Act equipped $750 million in HUD resources to Indian County to support the continuing relief towards the impacts of COVID-19. In 2021, HUD made a historic $450 million investment in Indian Housing Block Grants (IHBG-ARP) to Indian tribes across the country to respond to the pandemic. The Department also invested $5 million in COVID-19 relief for Native Hawaiians.

03/18/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-048.cfm,HUD Charges St. Louis Area Landlord with Sexually Harassing Female Tenant,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) on Friday, March 18, 2022, charged Nedzad Ukejnovic, the owner of multiple single-family residences in the St. Louis Metropolitan area of Missouri, with discrimination for allegedly subjecting a female tenant to sexual harassment, including requests for sexual favors in exchange for reduced rent, and discriminatory statements based on sex. Read HUD charge.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits sexual harassment of tenants and other forms of housing discrimination based on race, sex, color, national origin, disability, religion and familial status.
""No one should have to submit to unwelcome sexual advances or tolerate sexual harassment to keep their home, a place where a person should feel safest,"" said Demetria L. McCain, HUD's Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Today's charge sends a clear message to all landlords that HUD is committed to taking action against landlords whose behavior violates the Fair Housing Act.""
""The intolerable and deplorable conduct alleged in this case constitutes sexual harassment that violates the Fair Housing Act,"" said Damon Smith, HUD's General Counsel. ""HUD is steadfastly committed to protecting the rights of tenants to be free from such harassment by their landlords.""
HUD's charge, issued on behalf of the tenant, her children and the Metropolitan St. Louis Equal Housing Opportunity Council, a HUD Fair Housing Initiative partner, alleges that Ukejnovic made repeated unwelcome sexual advances toward the tenant and pressured her to provide sexual favors and explicit photos of herself when she fell behind on rent payments. The charge further alleges Ukejnovic's actions included grabbing the tenant's body without permission, pressing his body against hers, offering to accept sexual favors in lieu of rent, making unwanted sexual comments, and sending lewd and inappropriate texts to her. The tenant and her children moved out after enduring months of sexual harassment from Ukejnovic.
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to the complainant for harm caused by discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose fines to vindicate the public interest. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages.
Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY)."
03/22/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-049.cfm,"HUD Announces $3 Billion to Advance Equitable Disaster Recovery, Build Climate Resilience","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced the allocation of nearly $3 billion in Community Development Block Grant-Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) funds to help communities recover from disasters and build inclusive resilience to climate change. These allocations underscore HUD and the Biden-Harris Administration's commitment to equitably improving the nation's disaster recovery and building long-term, inclusive resilience to the impacts of climate change, particularly for historically marginalized communities.
""These disaster recovery funds will strengthen recovery efforts and improve long-term, inclusive resilience to future disasters and climate impacts,"" said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""Communities will have greater resources and focus to ensure equitable outcomes for underserved households that too often bear the brunt of climate-related disasters. With these funds, we are sending a strong message that equity and forward-looking mitigation are priorities of HUD and this administration's disaster recovery work.""
HUD is allocating $2.214 billion to 10 local governments and 13 state governments for 16 major disasters in 2021. HUD is also allocating an additional $722.7 million to five of the previously announced 2020 disaster recovery grants to reflect the higher level of need than previously calculated for disasters in those states.
""I contacted Sec. Fudge to personally thank her for this significant allocation that should provide Louisiana with an opportunity to implement a more effective, albeit late, recovery from Hurricanes Laura and Delta,"" Gov. Edwards said. ""I'm grateful to the Biden-Harris administration for their commitment to helping our communities and those around the nation recover from the impacts of these devastating storms. In addition, Louisiana will receive $1.27 billion for recovery from Hurricane Ida and other 2021 disasters. However, the need is much greater, which everyone we have spoken with in Washington acknowledges. We will continue working to secure that additional funding.""
""Thank you to Secretary Fudge and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development on the allocation of $74,953,000 additional dollars in Community Development Block Grant-Disaster Recovery funds to help Kentucky communities recover from disasters,"" said Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear. ""After two years of devastating tornadoes, flooding and ice storms, we are looking forward to seeing how this funding can help make an impact in our long-term recovery efforts.""
These funds will go to recover from and build resilience to natural disasters, including climate disasters, with a specific focus on low- and moderate-income populations. The funds are specified to be used for: ""disaster relief, long-term recovery, restoration of infrastructure and housing, economic revitalization, and mitigation, in the most impacted and distressed areas.""
With today's allocations, HUD has now allocated the remaining funds of the $5 billion appropriated in Public Law No. 117-43 on 9/30/2021 (Extending Government Funding and Delivering Emergency Assistance Act) for CDBG-DR funds. In November 2021, HUD allocated more than $2 billion in CDBG-DR for 2020 disasters. In January 2022, HUD opened access to those more than $2 billion, issuing a notice requiring all grantees to incorporate disaster mitigation measures into all recovery activities involving construction and to advance equitable distribution of the disaster recovery assistance. HUD's notice underscored the agency's commitment to ensuring that equity and forward-looking mitigation are prioritized in recovery activities.
Equitable disaster recovery and resilience is a priority of HUD's Climate Action Plan. HUD's Climate Action Plan notes that the Department is committed to advancing the goals of Executive Order 13985, which requires HUD to allocate resources in a manner that equitably invests in underserved communities, especially communities of color. HUD is committed to taking actions to invest in climate resiliency to reinforce its mission of creating strong, sustainable, and inclusive communities with affordable homes for all.

03/23/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-050.cfm,Biden-Harris Administration Unveils Action Plan of Wide-Ranging Set of Reforms to Advance Equity in Appraisals,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced the delivery of the Interagency Task Force on Property Appraisal and Valuation Equity (PAVE) Action Plan to President Biden. The PAVE Action Plan is aimed squarely at dismantling racial bias in the home lending and appraisal process and promoting generational wealth creation through homeownership. This Action Plan, when enacted, represents the most wide-ranging set of reforms ever put forward to advance equity in the home appraisal process. The PAVE Task Force, co-chaired by HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge and White House Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice, is the first-of-its-kind interagency initiative to address racial bias in home appraisals and includes senior leaders from thirteen Cabinet and independent agencies and components of the Executive Office of the President.
President Biden first announced the creation of the Task Force on the June 1, 2021 centennial of the Tulsa Race Massacre, where he charged federal agencies with evaluating the causes, extent, and consequences of appraisal bias and establishing a transformative set of actions to root out inequity. Homeownership remains the biggest driver of the wealth gap, with wide racial and ethnic disparities in homeownership rates and the financial return associated with owning a home. Today, the median white family holds eight times the wealth of the average Black family and five times the wealth of the average Latino family.
The PAVE Task Force engaged more than 150 stakeholder groups including appraisers, appraisal management companies, lenders, civil rights and advocacy groups, academic institutions, philanthropy organizations, and individuals who have experienced instances of appraisal bias to listen and learn diverse perspectives on what is working and how the Federal government can work to embed equity in the home valuation process.
The Plan outlines actions that will substantially reduce racial bias in home appraisals, including steps federal agencies will take using their existing authorities to enhance oversight and accountability of the appraisal industry and empower homeowners and homebuyers to take action when they receive a valuation that is lower than expected.
""For generations, millions of Black and brown Americans have had their homes valued for less than their white counterparts simply because of the color of their skin or the racial makeup of the neighborhood. Black and brown homeowners in communities just like mine have not felt that they have had a voice or that the Federal government was doing enough to redress the issue of racial bias in the appraisal process. With the PAVE Task Force, the Biden-Harris Administration is taking a whole-of-government approach to fixing this problem,"" said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""We are proud of the work of this task force and we are looking forward to continuing to work within the Administration and with partners to do all we can to root out discrimination in the appraisal and homebuying process.""
""Since his very first day in office, President Biden has made advancing equity and racial justice a top priority across the entire federal government,"" said Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice. ""This PAVE Task Force took that responsibility seriously. We have a long way to go, but the steps laid out in this Action Plan will help our country reduce bias in home valuations, narrow the racial wealth gap, and deliver a stronger and more equitable future for all Americans.""
The PAVE Action Plan is available at PAVE.hud.gov.
The Task Force membership is comprised of the following officials:
Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (co-chair) White House Domestic Policy Advisor (co-chair) Attorney General of the United States Secretary of Agriculture Secretary of Labor Secretary of Veterans Affairs Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve (FRB) Chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Chairman of the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) Executive Director of the Appraisal Subcommittee (ASC)

New Home Sales Sales of new single-family houses in February 2022 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 772,000, according to estimates released jointly today by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. This is 2.0 percent (±11.9 percent)* below the revised January rate of 788,000 and is 6.2 percent (±13. 7percent)* below the February 2021 estimate of 823,000.
Sales Price The median sales price of new houses sold in February 2022 was $400,600. The average sales price was $511,000.
For Sale Inventory and Months' Supply The seasonally-adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of February was 407,000. This represents a supply of 6.3 months at the current sales rate.

EXPLANATORY NOTES
These statistics are estimated from sample surveys. They are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated average relative standard errors of the preliminary data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (‐0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90‐percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. Changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show irregular movement. It takes 4 months to establish a trend for new houses sold. Preliminary new home sales figures are subject to revision due to the survey methodology and definitions used. The survey is primarily based on a sample of houses selected from building permits. Since a ""sale"" is defined as a deposit taken or sales agreement signed, this can occur prior to a permit being issued. An estimate of these prior sales is included in the sales figure. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimate of total sales is revised about 4.6 percent. Changes in sales price data reflect changes in the distribution of houses by region, size, etc., as well as changes in the prices of houses with identical characteristics. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau's website (www.census.gov/construction/nrs/how_the_data_are_collected/index.html).
* The 90 percent confidence interval includes zero. In such cases, there is insufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero."
03/24/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-052.cfm,HUD Announces $72 Million Funding Opportunity to Help Youth Experiencing Homelessness,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is making $72 million in Youth Homelessness Demonstration Program (YHDP) funding available to up to 25 communities nationwide. Funding will be utilized for developing and implementing coordinated community approaches to preventing and ending youth homelessness and sharing that experience and communities around the country to mobilize them toward the same end. Read HUD's Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) here (www.grants.gov/web/grants/search-grants.html?keywords=FY%202021%20Youth%20Homelessness%20Demonstration%20Program%20(YHDP)%20).
""HUD has a responsibility to communities in this nation, especially youth. Housing greatly impacts our education, our employment, and our opportunities to thrive,"" said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""These grants underscore HUD's commitment to eradicating homelessness, especially among young people, who all need and deserve a safe place to call home.""
YHDP is unique because the program is informed by youth that have experienced homelessness. It is one of the first dedicated federal initiatives that funds permanent housing programs for youth, and focuses on building local coordinated systems for responding to youth homelessness. HUD continues to work closely with youth to develop and improve YHDP, relying upon the recommendations provided directly from young people who have experienced homelessness.
Eventual YHDP recipients will be able to use this funding to address youth homelessness in ways that are specifically tailored to their needs, including funding for housing units, wrap-around services, and housing support. YHDP will also support youth-focused performance measurements and coordinated entry systems. Once selected, communities will work with their youth action boards, child welfare agencies, and other community partners to create a comprehensive community plan to end youth homelessness. Communities will serve as leaders in the nation on the work to end homelessness among young people.
The NOFO reflects the Biden-Harris Administration's commitment to preventing and ending youth homelessness through a coordinated community approach. Specifically, the demonstration has seven primary objectives:
Build national momentum. Motivate state and local homelessness stakeholders and youth services providers, including Runaway and Homeless Youth providers across the country to prevent and end youth homelessness by forming new partnerships, addressing system barriers, conducting needs assessments, testing promising strategies, and evaluating their outcomes. Promote equity in the delivery and outcomes of homeless assistance. Executive Order 13985 calls on agencies to advance equity through identifying and addressing barriers to equal opportunity that communities may face due to government policies and programs. Similarly, HUD expects YHDP recipients to promote equity throughout the community's youth homeless response system for youth who are disproportionally more likely to experience homelessness, such as Black, Indigenous, Hispanic (non-white), and LGBTQ youth who are disproportionally more likely to experience homelessness. Awarded communities will promote equity throughout their youth homeless response system and all YHDP projects will measure and demonstrate equitable delivery and outcomes. This includes identifying barriers that led to any disparities in subpopulations being served and taking steps to eliminate these barriers in the community's youth homeless response system. Highlight the importance of youth leadership: Demonstrate effective models of strong leadership and agency by youth with lived experience in the community. Create replicable best practices of youth leadership for other communities. Evaluate the coordinated community approach. Evaluate coordinated community approaches to preventing and ending youth homelessness, including local and state partnerships across sectors and other planning operations. Expand capacity. Expand community capacity to serve youth experiencing homelessness (particularly by using a Housing First approach), pilot new models of assistance, and determine what array of interventions is necessary to serve the target population in their community. Evaluate performance measures. Evaluate the use of performance measurement strategies designed to better measure youth outcomes and the connection between youth program outcomes and youth performance measures on overall system performance for the Continuum of Care (CoC). Establish a framework for Federal program and TA collaboration. Determine the most effective way for Federal resources to interact within a state or local system to support a coordinated community approach to preventing and ending youth homelessness.

03/24/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-053.cfm,HUD Charges Property Manager and Owners of a Milwaukee Rooming House with Sexual Harassment and Disability Discrimination,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is charging Leaf Property Investment, LLC, Sam Leaf and Dennis Parker, owner and managers of a 19-unit rooming house in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, with discriminating against a former male tenant because of his sexual orientation and disability. Read the charge here.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits harassment of tenants and other housing discrimination because of race, sex, color, national origin, disability, religion, and familial status. As HUD stated in memoranda published last year following the Supreme Court's decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, sex discrimination under the Fair Housing Act includes discrimination because of sexual orientation or gender identity.
HUD's Charge of Discrimination alleges that Parker, the property manager, harassed the tenant because of his sexual orientation and disabilities. The Charge alleges that Parker's harassing conduct included making unwelcome, sexually aggressive verbal comments; demanding sexual favors; sending unwanted, threatening, and degrading text messages; and using slurs and other demeaning language about the tenant's sexual orientation and disability. HUD's Charge also alleges that after the tenant reported the harassment to the local police, Parker retaliated against him by threatening to terminate his tenancy and later punching him in the groin. The Charge further alleges that, as a result of Parker's illegal actions, the tenant was forced to vacate his unit.
""No one should feel unwelcome or unsafe in the sanctity of their own homes because of their sexual orientation or disability,"" said Demetria L. McCain, HUD's Principal Deputy Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Violating these rights is not only unacceptable, it is illegal.""
""This is an egregious case of harassment because of a tenant's sexual orientation and disability,"" said Damon Smith, HUD General Counsel. ""The Department has made clear that the Fair Housing Act protects people from such discrimination, and we will take strong enforcement action to stop housing providers from subjecting their tenants to such unlawful conduct.""
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he or she may award damages to the complainant for his loss as a result of the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, to deter further discrimination, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties in order to vindicate the public interest. If the case is heard in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages to the complainant.
People who believe they are the victims of housing discrimination should contact HUD at (800) 669-9777 (voice) 800-927-9275 (TTY) or the Department of Justice at (800) 896-7743 or 202-514-4713. Additional information is available at www.hud.gov/fairhousing and www.usdoj.gov."

Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies: @Harvard_JCHS (https://twitter.com/Harvard_JCHS/status/1506702462769680384): A home appraisal is a critical part of the homebuying and lending process but bias in home valuations limits the ability of Black and brown families to enjoy the financial returns associated with homeownership and contributes to the racial wealth gap. https://t.co/9U471ZzHEU
Housing Policy Council (HPC): ""HPC congratulates the PAVE task force on the release of a detailed Action Plan, following a six-month intensive and inclusive process to examine disparities in the valuation of residential properties. As the report highlights, the steps that federal agencies take to address these disparities will advance the Administration's critical work to shrink the homeownership and wealth gaps affecting households and communities of color. HPC and our member companies support these efforts and PAVE's goal to root out discrimination in the appraisal and homebuying process and are pleased to see that the Plan embraces several of the actions recommended by HPC.
The PAVE task force has set forth a series of initiatives that should have a meaningful impact on the quality and accuracy of appraisals, identifying ways to address regulatory challenges, improve consumer understanding, expand and enhance data and research, and update the professional qualifications to become an appraiser. We look forward to continued close engagement with the PAVE task force as it embarks on the critical work to pursue the actions identified in the Plan.""
MBA President and CEO Bob Broeksmit: ""MBA welcomes the release of the report of the Interagency Task Force on Property Appraisal and Valuation Equity (PAVE), which provides a detailed and comprehensive action plan to combat appraisal bias. While the role of mortgage lenders in the appraisal process is limited by design, MBA and its members are committed to working with policymakers and other stakeholders, including appraisers, to develop solutions that ensure borrowers receive a fair and accurate estimate of the value of their homes.
""MBA and its members have made improving the appraisal process a top policy issue, and have prioritized it both as part of our CONVERGENCE initiative to promote more sustainable, affordable housing for minority and low- to moderate-income families and communities, and as part of our Building Generational Wealth Through Homeownership campaign.
""We appreciate the work that the PAVE task force has undertaken to document the historical foundations of inequitable property valuations and to identify ways to address problems in modern appraisal processes. Many of the initiatives announced today can be an important step in the fight toward eliminating biases, improving appraisal accuracy, and opening access to more affordable, sustainable homeownership opportunities for minority borrowers.
""While the report notes that many of the reforms can be put in place under existing authorities, it will be important for Task Force agencies to provide ample notice and comment opportunities for stakeholders during the implementation process.""
NAACP Legal Defense Fund Director of Policy, Lisa Cylar Barrett: ""We commend the Biden-Harris Administration for taking this important step to change the long-standing practice of undervaluing the homes owned by people of color, especially those in Black and Brown communities. This practice has had a profound, multi-generational impact on the ability of Black and Brown Americans to build wealth. ""Homeownership is touted as part of 'the American Dream' and is a sound wealth-building practice, but ongoing discrimination in appraisals has led to immense losses. By some accounts, in majority-Black neighborhoods, those loses are well over $150 billion. ""LDF looks forward to continuing to work with the administration and other stakeholders on this effort and others to ensure that Black and Brown Americans have the rights and protections needed to work, live, and thrive without barriers to equality.""

A few findings from the report: https://pave.hud.gov/actionplan
The report found an evident market value gap between majority-Black and majority-White neighborhoods spanning decades, noting that undervaluation often results in a negative impact on both the seller and buyer, sometimes causing the sale to fall through. Home undervaluation can also result in a downward price renegotiations, leading to a reduction of the seller's financial gains. PAVE included several actions targeted at reducing appraisal bias such as expanding the use of alternative traditional appraisals as well as modernizing the appraisal process, something NAFCU has been supportive of. PAVE is also looking to build a well-trained, diverse appraiser workforce, and wants to empower consumers to take actions regarding appraisal bias. .@FHFA Director Sandra Thompson, who spoke about appraisal modernization at NAFCU's #2021Caucus, applauded PAVE co-chairs @SecFudge & @AmbRice46 ""for their leadership of the PAVE Task Force and the development of this final report.""

Addressing those wrongs is key to providing financial stability to not only homeowners, but entire communities, and benefits the nation as a whole.""
National Community Reinvestment Coalition (NCRC) General Counsel Brad Blower and Senior Director of Policy Megan Haberle: Today the Interagency Task Force on Property Appraisal and Valuation Equity (PAVE) issued its action plan to root out racial and ethnic bias in home valuations, a widespread problem that helps drive the racial wealth gap. The action plan is a bold leap forward in documenting the impact of such bias and setting out specific solutions. It identifies the historical role of racism in the valuation of rental property, examines various forms of bias in property valuation, and lays out a roadmap of concrete action steps under a whole-of-government approach (https://ncrc.org/pave-task-force-action-plan-to-address-appraisal-bias-is-a-bold-leap-forward/).
The action plan is a significant step forward in addressing appraisal bias. NCRC commits to working with the federal government and the appraisal industry to bring the Plan's commitments into being – and to get us all to a better place, where discrimination does not stand in the way of financial security and fair treatment.
National Fair Housing Alliance (NFHA) President and CEO Lisa Rice: ""The appraisal industry is crucial in setting home values and shaping the financial well-being of millions of American families for whom a home is their main financial asset. NFHA applauds the bold leadership of Secretary Marcia Fudge and Director Susan Rice in issuing this comprehensive, well-researched Action Plan to address the systemic devaluation of homes of Black, Latino, Native, and AAPI consumers. Although the Fair Housing Act was passed in 1968, recent news stories and studies have shown that appraisal discrimination continues to restrict homeownership and lending opportunities for borrowers of color. In fact, the Black/White homeownership gap is larger than it was when redlining was legal, and it remains high for other communities of color. Because homeownership is the key to building wealth in the United States, it is not surprising that the racial and ethnic wealth gap also remains large and persistent. The PAVE Task Force's Action Plan is a major step forward in identifying concrete measures that can ensure a fair, transparent, and reliable appraisal process, as well as the means of expanding inclusive homeownership opportunities, particularly for borrowers of color.
""As the NFHA Consortium found in its recent report, the appraisal industry has operated with little scrutiny or oversight. By comparison, other sectors of the mortgage market have evolved to engage substantive reforms and adopt less discriminatory practices. Without honest conversations about appraisal bias, coupled with meaningful reforms, the homeownership and wealth gaps will remain stubbornly entrenched. We hope that the findings in the PAVE Action Plan and the NFHA Consortium report will promote steps among key stakeholders in the appraisal and housing industry to seek workable, sustainable solutions that benefit the whole of the housing market, including communities of color. We call on Congress, federal regulators, the industry, and fellow advocates to work together to enact the meaningful changes necessary for real reform. Any entity with a role in the appraisal process has a responsibility to help address these inequities.""
Senator Sherrod Brown, Chair of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs: ""Black and brown families face greater barriers to homeownership at every turn – including in the appraisal process. The PAVE Task Force's Action Plan lays out a clear path to identify and address systemic bias in appraisals, strengthen fair housing oversight, expand and diversify the appraiser workforce, and empower consumers to call out bias. I look forward to working with Secretary Fudge and the Biden-Harris Administration to ensure all homeowners can access the same benefits from homeownership.""

03/28/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-055.cfm,Statement by HUD Secretary Fudge on the President's Fiscal Year 2023 Budget,"The Biden-Harris Administration today submitted to Congress the President's Budget for fiscal year 2023. The President's Budget details his vision to expand on the historic progress our country has made over the last year and deliver the agenda he laid out in his State of the Union address-to build a better America, reduce the deficit, reduce costs for families, and grow the economy from the bottom up and middle out.
""HUD's mission is critical to achieving the President's vision to build a better America-one where we are ensuring that every person has a shot to get ahead and addressing longstanding systemic challenges, including racial injustice, rising inequality, and the climate crisis,"" said U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""This Budget tells the American people that the President, and our agency, view housing as a foundational platform to help address the most urgent challenges facing our nation. This Budget will help us meet our mission to provide security and stability for those who live on the outskirts of hope, advance opportunity and equity on behalf of marginalized communities, and meet the existential threats posed by natural disasters and climate change.""
The 2023 President's Budget requests $71.9 billion for HUD, approximately $11.6 billion more than the 2022 annualized continuing resolution (CR) level. The Budget outlines an ambitious agenda to address challenges our nation faces, ranging from climate change to housing discrimination to racial equity in homeownership and rental housing, to ending homelessness.
The Budget makes critical investments in the American people that will help lay a stronger foundation for shared growth and prosperity for generations to come. For HUD and those it serves, the Budget would:
Support Underserved Communities and Equitable Community Development. The Budget fortifies support for underserved communities and supports equitable community development for all people. To quickly house more people experiencing housing insecurity, the Budget provides $32.1 billion for the Housing Choice Voucher Program, which accommodates 200,000 new vouchers - the largest one-year increase in vouchers since the program was authorized in 1974 - prioritizing survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, stalking, and human trafficking, and households experiencing homelessness. The Budget also provides $8.8 billion for the Public Housing Fund, which provides grants to Public Housing Authorities to operate, maintain, and make capital improvements to the approximately 1.7 million residents of public housing. The Budget also addresses the nation's homelessness, crisis, providing $3.576 billion, an increase of $576 million, for Homeless Assistance Grants, to help communities reduce homelessness among families, individuals, and youth, including survivors of domestic and dating violence, sexual assault, stalking, and human trafficking. Additionally, the Budget provides $3.8 billion for the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program, including $195 million in targeted resources to remove barriers and revitalize 100 of the most historically underserved neighborhoods in the United States, and $86 million for fair housing programs for targeted and coordinated enforcement, education, and outreach. Increases Supply of and Access to Affordable Housing. The Budget works to ensure that housing demand will be matched by adequate production of new homes and equitable access to housing opportunities for all people. It requests $35 billion for the Housing Supply Fund, a new mandatory program providing grants to State and local housing finance agencies and their partners to invest in strategies to increase the supply of affordable housing. Additionally, the Budget provides $2 billion for the HOME Investment Partnerships (HOME) Program, which has long served as an anchor of the nation's affordable housing system. The Budget proposes $15 billion to fully fund renewals and amendments in the Project-Based Rental Assistance, Housing for Persons with Disabilities, and Housing for the Elderly Programs, along with $180 million for new development in Section 202 Housing for the Elderly and Section 811 Housing for People with Disabilities. The Budget also proposes Ginnie Mae authority to securitize affordable multifamily housing loans made by Housing Finance Agencies (HFAs) and insured under the Federal Housing Administration's (FHA) Section 542(c) Risk-Sharing program. Promote Homeownership and Wealth-Building. The Budget promotes homeownership opportunities, equitable access to credit for home purchases and improvements, and wealth-building in underserved communities. It provides $15 million of credit subsidy through FHA for a Home Equity Accelerator Loan (HEAL) Pilot that would test new loan products designed to lower barriers to homeownership for first-generation and/or low-wealth first-time homebuyers. Additionally, the Budget provides a new $100 million set-aside under the HOME Program for the FirstHOME Downpayment Assistance initiative that would provide funding to States and insular areas to better support sustainable homeownership for first-generation and/or low-wealth first-time homebuyers. Advance Sustainable Communities, Climate Resilience, and Environmental Justice. The Budget advances sustainable communities by strengthening climate resilience and energy efficiency, promoting environmental justice, and recognizing housing's role as essential to health. It provides $1.1 billion in targeted climate resilience and energy efficiency improvements in public housing, Tribal housing, multifamily-assisted housing, and other assisted housing. In addition, it provides $400 million to remove dangerous health hazards from homes, including mitigating threats from fire, lead, carbon monoxide, and radon. It provides $250 million to help communities develop and implement locally driven comprehensive neighborhood plans to transform underserved neighborhoods. The Budget also supports authorizing the Community Development Block Grant-Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) program and Ginnie Mae's continuing Environmental, Social, and Governance disclosure efforts, which are intended to drive new liquidity to more environmentally sustainable products by meeting growing investor demand. Strengthen HUD's Internal Capacity to Carry Out Its Mission. The Budget provides HUD with robust resources to strengthen its internal capacity and efficiency to better ensure delivery of the Department's mission. The 2023 Budget requests $1.8 billion toward salaries and expenses (S&E), $306 million more than the annualized CR level for 2022, which, in combination with carryover of 2022 funding, will support 8,326 full-time equivalent (FTE) employees. The 2023 Budget will support the gains made in 2021 and projected for 2022 and provide for continued increases in staffing, which will enable the Department to more effectively and efficiently serve households and communities across the country. The Budget also proposes $382 million for the IT Fund, to continue to invest in much needed modernization of HUD's IT systems, infrastructure, and cybersecurity.

03/28/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-056.cfm,"HUD Closes Rental Assistance Demonstration Conversion Transaction with the Housing Authority of Duluth, Minnesota, to Preserve 387 Homes for Low-Income Iron Range Families","WASHINGTON, D.C. - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Office of Multifamily Housing on March 24 closed a Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) transaction with the Housing and Redevelopment Authority (HRA) of Duluth, Minnesota, to preserve 387 affordable homes at the public housing authority's King Manor and Tri-Towers properties. These two adjacent buildings are connected by a skywalk and consist of 371 one-bedroom homes and 16 two-bedroom homes. These homes are located in an area of high opportunity, within one half mile of the downtown Duluth business district, with access to a significant regional job center, medical resources and other amenities.
The RAD transaction includes $218,000 in the initial construction budget and $4.2 million in funding for the property's reserve funds to be held for future repairs (total of $11,300 per unit). The transaction is funded via:
A commercial FHA-insured 223(f) loan from Bellwether Enterprise Public Housing Capital Funds
• A commercial FHA-insured 223(f) loan from Bellwether Enterprise
• Public Housing Capital Funds
The initial rehabilitation plan for this transaction includes numerous repairs for accessibility compliance so that these units are safe, accessible and usable by people of all ages and abilities. Additionally, upgrades will be made to the electrical systems in the two buildings. A significant amount of funding will also be placed in a reserve fund so that the property can make ongoing repairs over the next 20 years.
The project will be owned by North Pointe Apartments, LLC with HRA of Duluth serving as the sole member. HRA will continue to manage the property post-conversion.
About RAD
RAD was designed to help address the multi-billion-dollar nationwide backlog of deferred maintenance in the public housing portfolio and to stem the loss of affordable housing that could no longer be kept to decent standards. From the program's inception through March 1, 2022, the Rental Assistance Demonstration has facilitated more than $14 billion in capital investment to improve or replace nearly 175,000 deeply rent-assisted homes, most of which house extremely low-income families, seniors, and persons with disabilities.
Under RAD, projects funded under the public housing program convert their public housing assistance to project-based Section 8 rental assistance. Under Section 8, residents continue to pay 30% of their income towards rent and the housing must continue to serve those with very low and extremely low incomes, as was the case when the property was assisted through the public housing program. Residents must be notified and consulted prior to conversion, are given a right to return to assisted housing post-construction so that the same tenants can enjoy these newly preserved and improved apartments and maintain the same fundamental rights they had as public housing residents.

More programmatic information is available at the RAD website. Data on RAD is available at the RAD Resource Desk (www.radresource.net/pha_data2020.cfm).

04/01/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-058.cfm,HUD Commemorates National Fair Housing Month 2022,"WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) kicked off Fair Housing Month 2022. This year's Fair Housing Month theme, Fair Housing: More Than Just Words, underscores the Biden-Harris Administration's commitment and progress toward advancing equity in housing and securing equal access to housing opportunities for all.
""The Fair Housing Act recognized what generations have known - that where we live impacts nearly every part of our lives,"" said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""Fair Housing Month is a time to recommit to our mission to promote fairness, inclusion, and justice in housing. This month and every month, we are doing everything in our power to ensure every person has a fair shot at the American dream.""
""Although the Fair Housing Act was passed 54 years ago, we are still fighting against discrimination in housing today,"" said Demetria L. McCain, Principal Deputy Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""This April, HUD is renewing its commitment to end housing discrimination and to ensure every person has equal access to safe, affordable housing.""
Each April, HUD, local communities, fair housing advocates, and fair housing organizations across the country celebrate Fair Housing Month by hosting an array of fair housing activities that highlight fair housing enforcement efforts, enhance public awareness of fair housing rights, and emphasize the importance of creating diverse and inclusive communities.
Secretary Fudge will commemorate Fair Housing Month with a virtual celebration on April 5th at 2:00 P.M. (EDT) that will also feature the U.S. Department of Justice Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Kristen Clarke; HUD's Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity Demetria McCain; HUD General Counsel Damon Smith; and Executive Director of the Interagency Task Force on Property Appraisal and Valuation Equity (PAVE) and FHEO Regional III Director Melody Taylor. The event will showcase HUD's efforts to advance and protect fair housing rights to ensure that all people have the right to obtain the housing of their choice, free from discrimination.

Participants highlighted the capacity constraints throughout the reconstruction and relocation process after the extreme weather events that have impacted the island over the past decade. Secretary Fudge and participants discussed strategies to measure performance, analyze reconstruction and disaster recovery funds, and partner with local leaders to benefit marginalized communities in Puerto Rico.
At the end of the listening session, Secretary Fudge emphasized HUD's mission of providing the equitable opportunity to safe, stable, resilient, and affordable housing for all communities in the nation. Following the listening session, the Secretary visited a home rehabilitated with Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) funding and welcomed a resident to it for the first time.

During the policy expert roundtable, Secretary Fudge participated in discussions with participants on reconstruction strategies. Experts discussed the history of public housing and housing security in Puerto Rico, and the need to resolve the supply and demand needs for residents.
Participants also shed light on how the storm damages and reconstruction rates have perpetuated income segregation, poverty concentration, and opportunity and affordability disparities. Secretary Fudge and participants also discussed the billions of dollars in disaster relief that HUD, under this Administration, has made available to the island for reconstruction and resilience. While closing the conversation, Secretary Fudge assured consistent meetings between the Department and stakeholders on the ground to move forward with evidence-based solutions and build capacity.
Following the roundtable, the Secretary met with anti-gender based violence advocates. At the top of the meeting, the Secretary highlighted the programs at HUD that address gender-based violence.
Advocates - with lived experience - from various anti-gender-based violence organizations highlighted housing insecurity as a high-risk factor among victims. Advocates noted that the hurricanes, earthquakes, and pandemic have negatively affected victims via housing insecurity, unemployment, malnourishment, and compromised security. Participants also noted the racial and gender bias within the reconstruction process.
Secretary Fudge thanked the advocates for their time and for their candor, reiterating HUD's commitment to preventing gender-based violence by ensuring that everyone has equitable access to safe, affordable housing. The Secretary suggested the opportunity to create a pool of resources and ensured that HUD will facilitate meetings between the government and advocates. She also assured continued collaboration with experts, including at HUD, to meet the urgency of the situation so that survivors can safely reach self-sufficiency.
Finalizing the Loiza trip, Secretary Fudge and the HUD team met with local private sector leaders to discuss HUD programs, affordable housing, reconstruction, and economic recovery. The Secretary noted the various concerns from local mayors, nonprofits, direct service providers, policy experts, and advocates to facilitate partnerships and build capacity towards permanent solutions. Secretary Fudge also stressed the importance of ensuring that federal housing investments are spent efficiently and effectively.
On April 1, Secretary Fudge visited St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands to tour Estate Donoe, a Tutu Phase I Redevelopment Project, visit Celestino A. White Senior Homes Development, and participated in a roundtable with USVI nonprofit community organizations.

Throughout the site visits, Secretary Fudge was joined by Robert Graham, Executive Director of the Virgin Islands Housing Authority; Dayna Clendinen, Interim Executive Director of the Virgin Islands Housing Finance Authority; and site residents. The Secretary analyzed the disaster recovery efforts and discussed the importance of ongoing collaboration toward an equitable recovery.
During the roundtable, the Secretary listened to nonprofit community organizations that have participated in the recovery efforts from previous extreme weather events. The Secretary assured HUD's commitment to strengthen existing relationships and meet the urgency of strengthening resilience to mitigate the effects of climate change.
The Secretary's visit to Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands emphasizes HUD and the Biden-Harris administration's commitment to strengthening resilience and housing security for all communities in the nation."
04/05/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-060.cfm,HUD Makes Additional $3.3 Million in American Rescue Plan Funds Available to Fight Housing Discrimination Related to the Coronavirus Pandemic,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced on Tuesday that it is making an additional $3,285,353 in American Rescue Plan (ARP) funding available to help HUD's Fair Housing Initiatives Program (FHIP) agencies combat housing discrimination related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Organizations that qualify for the funding, which is being awarded through FHIP's Private Enforcement Initiative (PEI) component, will be able to use the money to conduct a range of fair housing enforcement and education and outreach activities, including addressing discriminatory practices in underserved communities.
The funds constitute the third round of ARP funding that targets COVID-19 related discrimination.

""The COVID-19 pandemic continues to reveal inequities in housing opportunities for many communities,"" said Demetria L. McCain, HUD's Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Our fair housing partners will utilize these additional funds to oppose discriminatory practices and safeguard housing rights for American families.""
In addition to enforcement and education and outreach activities, the funding can be used to respond to housing inquiries, conduct fair housing testing, provide legal assistance, and cover costs associated with providing services related to the pandemic.

People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 877-8339 (Relay). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to www.hud.gov/fairhousing."
04/06/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-061.cfm,Secretary Fudge Delivers Remarks at Fair Housing Month Virtual Ceremony,"WASHINGTON - Secretary Marcia L. Fudge on Tuesday delivered virtual remarks at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity annual Fair Housing Month Ceremony.
View the recording of Tuesday's Fair Housing Month Ceremony here (www.youtube.com/watch?v=8req4u8Lw8A).
Remarks as delivered by Secretary Fudge:
I am thrilled to join you to commemorate the 54th anniversary of a law that guarantees one of our most basic rights—the right to be free from housing discrimination.
On April 11, 1968, 54 years ago, at the height of the Civil Rights Movement, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Fair Housing Act into law.
The Fair Housing Act recognized what generations have known—that where we live impacts nearly every part of our lives from the schools our children attend; to access to jobs; to the health care we receive; and the air we breathe.
As you may know, the Fair Housing Act was born out of the Civil Rights Movement. In fact, just the day before the bill passed the Senate, Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. had been assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee.
Dr. King fought for fair housing for so, so many years.
Black and brown members of the armed forces were returning home from the Vietnam war, unable to reap the same benefits of the GI bill, unable to rent or purchase the same homes at the same prices in the same neighborhoods as their white counterparts.
The Fair Housing Act is very much a piece of Dr. King's legacy.
54 years after the passage of the Fair Housing Act, access to the security and wealth a stable home can provide remains persistently unequal.
But it is a new day.
Under this Administration, HUD is working to make real the promises of the Fair Housing Act. I am proud to say that over the last year, we have taken action to tackle the root causes of discrimination in housing.
In his first week in office, President Biden issued a directive that HUD take actions that undo historic patterns of segregation and other types of discrimination in a manner that affirmatively furthers fair housing. Last year, HUD published an interim final rule that requires every local government that accepts federal housing dollars to certify compliance on affirmatively furthering fair housing. HUD is also in the process of designing a rule, in consultation with stakeholders, to more comprehensively implement the ""affirmatively furthering fair housing"" requirement. We look forward to sharing more on this in the coming months.
We know the COVID-19 pandemic worsened our nation's already severe housing crisis. However, I am pleased to share that thanks to the American Rescue Plan, HUD has made available more than $67 million in grants and annual appropriations to our partners committed to fighting fair housing discrimination, including pandemic-related housing discrimination.
Next, we know that every person should be treated with respect and dignity and should be able to live without fear, no matter who they are or whom they love. In February 2021, HUD clarified—for the first time—that the Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation.
This past year, we have seen more people than ever seek protection under the Fair Housing Act for discrimination they have faced due to their gender identity or sexual orientation.
HUD is committed to combatting this unfair and unlawful discrimination.
On his first day in office, President Biden signed an executive order that directed every federal agency to explore solutions for advancing racial equity.
HUD takes that mandate seriously.
In a step to address discrimination in the housing market, HUD made clear that the use of certain Special Purpose Credit Programs to help address inequities in barriers to credit and, or homeownership are lawful under the Fair Housing Act
In July, HUD, along with the Domestic Policy Council, launched the Task Force on Property Appraisal and Valuation Equity, or PAVE, a first-of-its kind interagency task force to combat bias in the housing market. The PAVE Task Force is taking bold, concerted action to close America's racial wealth gap by rooting out systemic racism from our housing appraisal market.
In a bit, you will hear Melody Taylor, the Executive Director of PAVE. Melody has been a force within HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity for more than 20 years and I look forward to her sharing the accomplishments and vision of this initiative.
I want to thank Demetria, Melody, and the rest of the team at the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, for their important work.
I also want to recognize the stakeholders who are critical partners in continuing to promote fairness, inclusion, and justice in housing.
We can and will do everything in our power to ensure everyone has a fair shot at the American dream.
Together, we can make major strides toward forging a more equitable America."
04/11/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-062.cfm,"FACT SHEET: On the 54th Anniversary of the Fair Housing Act, HUD Underscores its Commitment and Progress Toward Advancing Fairness and Equity in Housing","
April 11, 2022, marks the 54th anniversary of the enactment of the federal Fair Housing Act. On April 11, 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, also known as the Fair Housing Act. The Fair Housing Act protects people from discrimination when they are renting or buying a home, getting a mortgage, seeking housing assistance, or engaging in other housing-related activities. The statute also directs all executive departments and agencies to administer their programs and activities relating to housing and urban development, including any Federal agency having regulatory or supervisory authority over financial institutions, in a manner affirmatively to further the purposes of the Act.
Initially, the Fair Housing Act prohibited discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion and national origin. Later, the Act's protections were expanded to include discrimination on the basis of sex, disability, and familial status. In February 2021, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) clarified that the Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation.
Today, under the leadership of Secretary Marcia L. Fudge, HUD continues to prioritize its commitment to strengthening fair housing protections and enforcement. In the first year of the Biden-Harris Administration, HUD's actions included:
Fighting Housing Discrimination Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated our nation's already severe housing crisis. HUD's Fair Housing Initiatives Program (FHIP) has been an essential part of the federal government response. To date, HUD has made available $19.4 million in American Rescue Plan (ARP) funding to FHIP agencies working to address the unequal impact the pandemic has had on communities of color, low-income communities, and other vulnerable populations. The funding provides resources and support to victims of housing discrimination who have been most impacted by the pandemic. FHIP agencies use the funding to conduct housing education and outreach activities, as well as address fair housing inquiries, complaints, and investigations.
Protecting the LGBTQ+ Community Against Housing Discrimination. Every person should be treated with respect and dignity and should be able to live without fear, regardless of who they are or whom they love. The Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (FHEO) continues to prioritize the implementation of fair housing protections for the LGBTQ+ community. This includes training, stakeholder engagement, updated website materials, and other activities. This past year, following HUD's clarification that the Fair Housing Act includes protection against discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation, FHEO has seen more people than ever seek protection under the Fair Housing Act for discrimination they have faced because of their gender identity or sexual orientation. Alongside its Fair Housing Initiatives Program (FHIP) and Fair Housing Assistance Program (FHAP) partners, HUD processed 235 cases alleging sex discrimination due to gender identity and sexual orientation in 2021, nearly twice as many cases than 2020.
In April 2021, HUD withdrew a previously proposed rule that would have weakened the Equal Access Rule, which ensures that all individuals - regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity - have equal access to Department programs, buildings, facilities, and other accommodations, including shelters. Ensuring people experiencing homelessness or at risk of experiencing homelessness have equal access to HUD programs is essential in addressing the challenges faced by transgender and gender non-conforming persons because transgender and gender non-conforming persons face enormous safety risks in shelters.
Restoring the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing Requirement. In his first week in office, President Biden issued a directive specifically calling on HUD to take actions to undo historic patterns of segregation and other types of discrimination in a manner that affirmatively furthers fair housing. In response, the Department published an interim final rule (IFR) that went into effect on July 31st to restore the implementation of the Fair Housing Act's Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing (AFFH) requirement. Under the restored AFFH regulatory definition in the IFR, HUD funding recipients must regularly certify compliance with the Fair Housing Act's AFFH requirement and commit to taking steps to remedy their fair housing issues in making such certifications. The IFR helps HUD, 3,747 public housing authorities, and 1,200 state and local government grantees in the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), HOME Investments Partnerships (HOME), and Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) programs fulfill their AFFH obligations under the Fair Housing Act.
HUD is consulting extensively with stakeholders during its process of designing a final rule, to more comprehensively implement the AFFH requirement.
Restoring the Discriminatory Effects Rule. In June, Secretary Fudge announced publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) entitled Reinstatement of HUD's Discriminatory Effects Standard (www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/06/25/2021-13240/reinstatement-of-huds-discriminatory-effects-standard), which would rescind the Department's 2020 disparate impact rule and restore the disparate impact doctrine citing that HUD believes the 2013 rule is more consistent with decades of caselaw and better effectuates the Act's broad remedial purpose of eradicating unnecessary discriminatory practices from the housing. A final rule is forthcoming. HUD's action was a direct response to President Biden's executive action (www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/26/memorandum-on-redressing-our-nations-and-the-federal-governments-history-of-discriminatory-housing-practices-and-policies/) directing the Department to examine rules regarding disparate impact.
Withdrew the ""Mixed-Status"" Rule. In April 2021, HUD published a rule withdrawal that removed the previously proposed ""mixed-status"" rule. That rule would have led to thousands of mixed-status immigrant families that have family members who are undocumented or otherwise be deemed ineligible for public and other subsidized housing. The old proposal would have caused families throughout the country to split up or be evicted.
Fighting Disability Discrimination. The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from discriminating against persons with disabilities, including refusing to make reasonable accommodations in policies or practices when such accommodations may be necessary to provide them an equal opportunity to use or enjoy a dwelling.
HUD also enforces other laws prohibiting disability discrimination to enable fair housing, including Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the Architectural Barriers Act. Later this year, HUD plans to publish an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to solicit comments to update its requirements for federally subsidized housing, such as public housing, project-based assistance, HOME, and other programs.
Housing providers may not prohibit people with disabilities from having assistance animals that perform work or tasks, provide assistance, and/or provide therapeutic emotional support for individuals with disabilities.
Launched a Whole-of-Government Plan for Wide-Ranging Reforms to Advance Equity in Home Appraisals. In March, HUD delivered the Interagency Task Force on Property Appraisal and Valuation Equity (PAVE) Action Plan to President Biden. The PAVE Action Plan is aimed squarely at dismantling racial bias in the home lending and appraisal process and promoting generational wealth creation through homeownership. This Action Plan, when enacted, represents the most wide-ranging set of reforms ever put forward to advance equity in the home appraisal process. The PAVE Task Force, co-chaired by Secretary Fudge and White House Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice, is the first-of-its-kind interagency initiative to address racial bias in home appraisals and includes senior leaders from thirteen Cabinet and independent agencies and components of the Executive Office of the President.
Affirmed the Use of Special Purpose Credit Programs. More than 50 years after the passage of the Fair Housing Act, access to security and wealth provided by homeownership remains persistently unequal. Part of the solution to that problem has to be for banks and others to find creative ways to extend credit to communities that desperately need it to start building equity. In December, HUD made clear that the use of certain Special Purpose Credit Programs (SPCPs) to help address inequities in barriers to credit and homeownership is lawful under the Fair Housing Act. The Special Purpose Credit Program is a tool that allows banks to meet the specific needs of these historically disadvantaged groups. On January 26, Secretary Fudge convened a virtual meeting with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Federal Reserve, Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), and National Credit Union Association to discuss HUD and partner agencies' roles in expanding homeownership opportunities for those who have been and continue to be systemically excluded from the housing and credit markets. The group discussed future steps to encourage use of SPCPs as a means of addressing persistent disparities in access to homeownership.
Set the Stage for Increased Fair Housing and Lending Enforcement and Access. Last summer, HUD entered into a first-of-its-kind memorandum of understanding (www.fhfa.gov/Media/PublicAffairs/PublicAffairsDocuments/FHFA-HUD-MOU_8122021.pdf) (MOU) with FHFA, marking a historic collaboration on fair housing and fair lending enforcement and oversight engagement with the FHFA-regulated entities including Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Banks. This comprehensive effort will ensure deeper collaboration on fair housing investigations and enable data sharing to help strengthen and affirmatively further fair housing for the mortgage industry.
In September 2021, HUD and FHFA jointly announced clarifications to Freddie Mac's policies making it clear that it will purchase mortgages secured by a property owned by an individual and rented to a group home for persons with disabilities. The clarifications follow a FHEO investigation of a mortgage lender who had refused to lend to a homeowner that was renting their property to a company that was operating a group home."
04/11/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-063.cfm,FACT SHEET: National Community Development Week,"
The week of April 11 through April 15 is National Community Development Week, a time to highlight the importance of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and HOME Investment Partnerships (HOME) programs to building strong, resilient, and vibrant communities across America.
CDBG and HOME provide grants to states and local governments to strengthen communities by delivering equitable access to decent housing and living environments and expanding economic opportunities. These programs are unique in that they focus primarily on people with low and moderate incomes. CDBG and HOME also play a critical role in empowering residents by giving them a voice in the future of their neighborhoods.
HUD and the Biden-Harris Administration remain committed to building stronger and more resilient communities across America through CDBG and HOME.
CDBG and HOME Have a Record of Success in Lifting Up Underserved Communities
CDBG and HOME increase the availability of safe, high quality, and affordable homes and communities, ensuring equitable access to opportunities and benefiting families and communities.
CDBG and HOME have:
Provided grants to state and local governments. In 2021, the CDBG program provided grants to 1,235 state and local governments.
Rehabilitated housing and strengthened access to public services. Since 2005, the CDBG program has rehabilitated 1,300,027 units of housing, funded public infrastructure projects that have assisted over 16 million people, and assisted over 161 million people with public services.
Expanded affordable housing. Since 1992, the HOME program has created over 1.3 million affordable homes and provided direct rental assistance to more than 363 thousand low-income families.
Provided Sources of Low-Cost, Long-Term Financing for Economic and Community Development Projects. In 2021, HUD marked over 2 thousand commitments through the CDBG Section 108 Loan Guarantee program. The program allows local governments to leverage five times their current CDBG grant into federally-guaranteed loans large enough to pursue physical and economic revitalization projects capable of redeveloping entire neighborhoods. The Section 108 program primarily benefits low- and moderate-income communities.
Advanced equitable disaster recovery to build resilience to climate change. In March 2022, HUD announced $3 billion in CDBG-Disaster Recovery funds, which include mitigation, to help communities recover from and build resilience to natural disasters, including climate disasters, with a specific focus on low-and moderate-income populations. In November 2021, HUD allocated $2 billion in CDBG-Disaster Recovery funds. The first such awards of the Biden-Harris Administration, reflecting an increased focus on building resilience in the most underserved communities.
Additional investments in CDBG and HOME are critical to building on these successes and enabling even more stronger and resilient communities.
President's FY23 HUD Budget Bolsters CDBG and HOME
The President's FY23 Budget request for HUD reflects the Administration's commitment to fortifying support for underserved communities and equitable community development for all people, with robust investments in CDBG and HOME.
If passed, the Budget would provide $3.8 billion for CDBG, including $195 million in targeted resources to remove barriers and revitalize 100 of the most historically underserved neighborhoods in the United States.
The Budget would also provide $2 billion for HOME - $450 million more than the FY22 enacted level.
Additionally, the Budget supports authorizing the Community Development Block Grant—Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) program. For more than twenty years, Congress has appropriated emergency supplemental funds to HUD in response to major disasters to address the unmet long term disaster recovery needs of States, territories, local governments, and Tribes. Authorization would improve the transparency and predictability of CDBG-DR funds for impacted communities.

HUD will continue to expand access to these critical programs, providing resources to support communities and ensure that they are equipped with the necessary services to thrive."

04/12/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-065.cfm,HUD Announces First-Ever HUD-Held Single Family Note Sale (HVLS 2022-2) Exclusively for Mission-Driven Non-Profits and Units of State and Local Government,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Office of Asset Sales announced on Tuesday that it will conduct a competitive bid HUD-held vacant note sale (HVLS 2022-2) on June 8, 2022 (www.falconassetsales.com/asset-sales/upcoming-sales). The sale will include approximately 1,450 reverse mortgage notes secured by properties where the borrower is deceased and not survived by a non-borrowing spouse. Consistent with the Biden-Harris Administration's September 1, 2021, announcement (www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/09/01/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-immediate-steps-to-increase-affordable-housing-supply/) that more HUD-owned properties should be returned to future owner-occupancy, participation in this sale will be limited to eligible, mission-driven non-profit organizations and units of state and local government - the first competitive bid sale exclusively for these entities.
""This sale reinforces our dedication to expanding the opportunities for non-profits and units of state and local government to purchase HUD-held assets that can be revitalized and returned to the housing market at a time when inventory is extremely low,"" said Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Housing Lopa P. Kolluri. ""We have structured this sale for exclusive participation by those organizations who share our mission of expanding affordable rental and homeownership opportunities for underserved communities.""
The sale further expands on HUD's previous work through its December 2021 vacant property note sale (HVLS 2022-1) where 50 percent of the mortgage notes in multi-loan pools were reserved for priority bidding by non-profit organizations and units of state and local government. 23 mission-driven non-profit organizations and joint ventures successfully participated in, and 11 were awarded pools in, that sale. Collectively, these entities successfully won bids on 814 mortgage notes - the entire volume of notes eligible for priority bidding.
As with the December 2021 sale, the June 8, 2022, sale seeks to increase affordable housing supply, expand opportunities for homeownership and rental housing, and revitalize communities through encouraging the disposition of these notes in a manner that achieves mission outcomes, including:
Selling properties to low- to moderate-income homebuyers at a price affordable to households earning less than 120 percent of the Area Median Family Income; and Leasing properties at rents affordable to households earning less than or equal to 80 percent of the Area Median Family Income.
• Selling properties to low- to moderate-income homebuyers at a price affordable to households earning less than 120 percent of the Area Median Family Income; and

04/13/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-066.cfm,HUD Announces Racial Equity Agreement with Affordable Rental Housing Provider,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced on Wednesday that it has entered into a Voluntary Compliance Agreement with JCL Management, LLC and Pilot Cove Manor Housing Development Fund Company, Inc., resolving a compliance review concerning non-discrimination in marketing and tenanting procedures. Pilot Cove Development is a 130-unit building on City Island in Bronx, New York, that provides affordable subsidized units though the Section 8 Housing Assistance Payment Program and the Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly Program. Read the Agreement.
This Agreement arises from a compliance review that was conducted by HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (FHEO) under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. FHEO opened the review based on information indicating disproportionately low participation rates of Black, Hispanic, and Asian residents relative to the housing market area. The review sought to ensure eligible persons were not discriminated against in opportunities to learn about, apply for, and reside in HUD-subsidized housing on the basis of race, color or national origin.
""HUD funded rental programs must be available to prospective residents of all racial and national origin groups,"" said Demetria L. McCain, HUD's Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""This agreement demonstrates HUD's commitment to ensure that marketing and admission policies are designed to avoid excluding residents because of their race, color, and national origin.""
HUD enforces the Fair Housing Act, which prohibits discrimination because of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, disability and familial status. HUD also enforces other federal civil rights laws, including Title VI of the Civil Rights Act which prohibits discrimination based on race, color, and national origin in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance.
The Agreement mandates the creation of a new waitlist after robust marketing to those least likely to apply. In addition, the Agreement requires recipients to commit to expending a minimum of $50,000 to advance fair housing choice in the region, including a minimum of $10,000 towards advertising and outreach (including website development); making applications available and accepting applications by mail, email, in person, and online; revising any policies that include an evaluation of credit or rental history consistent with civil rights laws and HUD's guidance; and, developing a revised language access plan; and temporarily waiving fees ordinarily charged to newly admitted residents. This Agreement does not constitute admissions by the housing providers or evidence of a final determination by HUD of violations of Title VI or any other laws.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 877-8339 (Relay). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to www.hud.gov/fairhousing."

The Loan Pool will be available to prospective borrowers citywide and will provide a ready source of long-term, fixed-rate, and reasonably priced financing that is not available conventionally. The Loan Pool will bridge financing gaps and enable borrowers to proceed with their respective transaction, create and retain jobs, increase affordable housing, advance equity and equitable development opportunities, and expand the existing tax base. Equitable development projects will include projects that support investments in communities and neighborhoods of color or provide financing to black, indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) led developers, businesses, or organizations.
""Often times, due to credit or other financial factors, many people lack access to loans,"" said Arthur Jemison, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary, Office of Community Planning and Development at HUD. ""This loan guarantee will facilitate access to borrowing for many people, bridging financing gaps that too many low-income communities are familiar with.""
The loan guarantee assistance was awarded through the Section 108 Loan Guarantee Program (Section 108), which provides Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) recipients with the ability to leverage their annual grant allocation to access low-cost, flexible financing for economic development, housing, public facility, and infrastructure projects.
This project will meet the Community Development Block Grant national objective of benefit to low- and moderate-income persons on an area basis.
The Section 108 Loan Guarantee Program allows local governments to leverage 5 times their current CDBG award into federally guaranteed loans large enough to pursue physical and economic revitalization projects capable of redeveloping entire neighborhoods. Public investment, such as Section 108 loans, can spur private economic activity, providing the resources or the confidence that private firms and individuals may need to invest in distressed areas.

As the need for economic recovery and community development continues, HUD's Section 108 program serves as a critical source of federal financing that helps to move projects forward and build strong, sustainable, inclusive communities."
04/14/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-068.cfm,HUD Releases First Ever Equity Action Plan,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) on Thursday released its first ever Equity Action Plan in coordination with the Biden-Harris Administration's whole-of-government equity agenda.
""Equity is central to HUD's founding principles and the daily work we do as a Department,"" said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""We are excited to take this opportunity to join the rest of the federal government in emphasizing our commitment to making equity a leading compass within this Administration.""
On his first day in office, President Biden signed Executive Order 13985 on ""Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government,"" directing the federal government to pursue a comprehensive approach to advancing equity for all. In response to the President's directive, HUD commenced a Department-wide plan, which included actions to reduce the racial homeownership gap and center equity in the delivery of services to people experiencing homelessness.
The decision to focus on homeownership reflected several priorities, such as the need to address a history of racial discrimination in federal programs - as reflected in the President's Memorandum on Redressing Our Nation's and the Federal Government's History of Discriminatory Housing Practices and Policies -; the Federal Housing Administration's role in supporting homeownership for first-time buyers; and the importance of homeownership for wealth building amongst all communities.
The Department is also focusing on advancing equity in its delivery of homelessness assistance programs. The Plan emphasizes how homelessness is experienced in cities, suburbs, rural areas, and tribal lands; across races and ethnicities; by individuals and families; young and old; male, female, transgender, and gender non-conforming. Even within homeless populations, some groups are less likely to have safe access to homeless shelters, and some are likely to experience homelessness for more extended periods.
HUD's Equity Action Plan is one of many steps HUD has taken to reiterate its commitment to advancing equity for all communities across the nation. The Equity Action plan, completed in collaboration with the White House, provided an opportunity to dive into a handful of areas that contributed to the agency's work on the strategic plan, which has equity as an underlining principle.

04/18/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-069.cfm,"HUD Closes Rental Assistance Demonstration Conversion Transaction with the Housing Authority of the City of Tampa, Florida, to Build 196 Deeply Affordable Rental Homes","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Office of Multifamily Housing on April 14closed a Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) transaction with the Housing Authority of the City of Tampa (THA) in Tampa, Florida, to replace 97 public housing units and create an additional 99 affordable homes for a total of 196 homes at the Canopy at West River community. This will double the amount of assisted housing that existed prior to the RAD transaction.
Canopy at West River Phase I is a new construction family project to be located in one seven-story high-rise building and one five-story midrise building on approximately 3.2 acres located in Tampa's West River neighborhood. Residents of the new development will have on-site amenities including garage parking, elevators, a laundry room, a fitness center, a game room and a community room. Additionally, this building will be outfitted with high-speed broadband access and will incorporate green and energy-efficient features.
Through its non-profit affiliate, THA has been in the process of transforming the West River neighborhood into an area with mixed-income housing, retail and office space, community services, as well as open space and parks. As part of this multiphase plan on the 44-acre site, THA has already completed several other conversions through RAD, totaling 506 permanently affordable RAD Section 8 homes and 110 other affordable homes. Upon completion of all the Housing Authority's North Boulevard transactions, this site will feature 670 RAD units in total. This transformation is expected to bring a new vitality to the West River neighborhood.
The RAD transaction includes a construction budget of $46.9 million ($239,000 per unit) fully financed through:
4% Low-Income Housing Tax Credits Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Funding Commercial First Mortgage Loan
• 4% Low-Income Housing Tax Credits
• Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Funding
• Commercial First Mortgage Loan
About RAD RAD was designed to help address the multi-billion-dollar nationwide backlog of deferred maintenance in the public housing portfolio and to stem the loss of affordable housing that could no longer be kept to decent standards. From the program's inception through February 1, 2022, the Rental Assistance Demonstration has facilitated more than $13.5 billion in capital investment to improve or replace nearly 175,000 deeply rent-assisted homes, most of which house extremely low-income families, seniors, and persons with disabilities.
Under RAD, converted homes are moved to the Section 8 platform with a long-term contract that, by law, must be renewed in perpetuity. Under Section 8, residents continue to pay 30% of their income towards rent and the housing must continue to serve those with very low and extremely low incomes, as was the case when the property was assisted through the public housing program. Residents must be notified and consulted prior to conversion, are given a right to return to assisted housing post-construction so that the same tenants can enjoy these newly preserved and improved apartments, and maintain the same fundamental rights they had as public housing residents.

04/18/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-070.cfm,Federal Housing Administration Adds 40-Year Mortgage Modification with Partial Claim to Home Retention Options for Struggling Borrowers,"WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) announced on Monday that it is adding a new, 40-year mortgage modification option for mortgage servicers to use in conjunction with its partial claim option to assist additional borrowers who are behind on their mortgage payments for FHA Title II forward mortgages. This new loss mitigation home retention option is designed to help those borrowers who cannot achieve a minimum targeted 25 percent reduction in the Principal and Interest portion of their mortgage payment through FHA's existing 30-year mortgage modification with a partial claim.
""Over the last year we have made substantive changes to our COVID-19 recovery options that are showing strong results in helping homeowners with FHA-insured mortgages recover from the devastating financial effects of the pandemic. Adding a 40-year modification with partial claim to our toolkit for servicers today reaffirms our long-term commitment to continue helping as many struggling homeowners as we can to keep their homes,"" said Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Housing and the Federal Housing Administration Lopa P. Kolluri.
The 40-year modification with partial claim is now included as a component of FHA's COVID-19 Recovery Modification and is consistent with 40-year modification options provided by other mortgage industry participants. The 40-year modification with partial claim is to be used by mortgage servicers for borrowers where FHA's other Recovery options are unable to achieve the minimum targeted 25 percent reduction.
Mortgage servicers may begin implementing the new 40-year modification with partial claim option immediately but must begin offering this solution to eligible borrowers with FHA-insured Title II forward mortgages, except those funded through Mortgage Revenue Bonds under certain circumstances, within 90 calendar days.
40-year Mortgage Modification Proposed Rule
On April 1, 2022, FHA published a proposed rule (www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/04/01/2022-06875/increased-forty-year-term-for-loan-modifications) in the Federal Register to solicit public comments on a proposal to allow servicers to provide a standalone 40-year loan modification option. The public comment period closes on May 31, 2022. When finalized, the rule will give FHA the ability to add a permanent 40 year term to its loss mitigation options.
FHA Single Family Loss Mitigation Home Retention Fact Sheet

Since January 2021 alone, more than 1.1 million borrowers have exited forbearance. From January 2021 through February 2022, FHA servicers have completed more than one million COVID-19 loss mitigation or other FHA loss mitigation home retention actions.

FHA COVID-19 Recovery Loss Mitigation Home Retention Options
FHA's COVID-19 Recovery options for use by mortgage servicers include the COVID-19 Advance Loan Modification (ALM). Available to owner-occupant and non-occupant borrowers, the COVID-19 ALM is a permanent change in one or more terms of a borrower's mortgage that achieves a minimum 25 percent reduction to the borrower's monthly Principal and Interest (P&I) payment and does not require borrower contact. Mortgage servicers will proactively mail the modified mortgage documents to borrowers who can achieve the required payment reduction. If the borrower chooses to accept the COVID-19 ALM they only need to sign and return the mortgage modification documents sent to them by their mortgage servicer.
FHA's current COVID-19 Loss Mitigation Home Retention ""waterfall"" of options for servicers to use with eligible owner-occupant borrowers with FHA-insured Title II forward mortgages contains the following:
COVID-19 Recovery Standalone Partial Claim: For borrowers who can resume making their current mortgage payments, the COVID-19 Recovery Standalone Partial Claim allows mortgage payment arrearages to be placed in a zero interest subordinate lien against the property. The Partial Claim amount does not require payment until the first of the following events occurs: the maturity of the FHA-insured mortgage, the sale of the property, the payoff of the FHA-insured mortgage, or if provided for under the Partial Claim note, the termination of FHA insurance, except that HUD will agree to subordinate the Partial Claim note to an FHA-Streamline Refinance. COVID-19 Recovery Modification: For borrowers who cannot resume making their current monthly mortgage payments, the COVID-19 Recovery Modification resolves the outstanding mortgage payment arrearages by adding it to the principal loan balance of the first mortgage. The mortgage servicer then extends the term for 30 years (360 months) at an interest rate that is no greater than the current fixed market interest rate identified in FHA policy as of the date the borrower is offered a COVID-19 Recovery Modification, or extends the term for 40-years (480 months) at an interest rate that is no more than 50 basis points greater than the current fixed market interest rate identified in FHA policy as of the date the borrower is offered a COVID-19 Recovery Modification. The COVID-19 Recovery Modification targets reducing the borrower's monthly principal and interest portion of their monthly mortgage payment. The COVID-19 Recovery Modification must include a Partial Claim, so the borrower must have Partial Claim funds available.

04/19/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-071.cfm,HUD Approves Agreement with Bank of America Resolving Claims of Familial Status and Sex Discrimination,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced on Tuesday that it has signed a Conciliation Agreement with Bank of America, N.A., and one of its loan officers to resolve allegations of familial status and sex discrimination under the Fair Housing Act. Bank of America and the loan officer allegedly refused to approve a residential mortgage for a couple until after one of the applicants returned to work from maternity leave. Read the agreement.
Under the Fair Housing Act, it is unlawful to discriminate in making loans for the purchase or refinance of residential real estate because of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, disability, or familial status. This includes refusing to provide a mortgage to a person on parental leave.
""Buying a new home for your expanding family should be a joyous occasion,"" said Demetria L. McCain, HUD's Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""The nation's fair housing laws prohibit lenders from denying home loans to families with children because a parent is on parental leave. We're glad this matter has been conciliated in a way that hopefully addresses at least some of the family's concerns. HUD remains committed to ensuring mortgage providers meet their fair lending obligations.""
The case came to HUD's attention when a married couple with a newborn child filed a complaint alleging that Bank of America, N.A., would not approve the couple's home loan application until the wife returned to work from maternity leave, even though her employer was paying her 80% of her salary during her maternity leave.
Under the Agreement, Bank of America will pay $15,000 to the couple; adhere to a policy wherein applicants on temporary leave, including parental leave, can be approved for a mortgage prior to returning to active work status; and provide fair lending training to employees in lending-related roles. This conciliation agreement does not constitute an admission by Bank of America or the loan officer or evidence of a finding by HUD of a violation of the Fair Housing Act.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 877-8339 (Relay). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to hud.gov/fairhousing.

04/20/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-073.cfm,HUD Announces $10.3 Million Loan Guarantee for Los Angeles County for Vermont Manchester Commercial Project,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announces a $10.3 million loan guarantee for the County of Los Angeles, California for the Vermont Manchester Commercial Project.
The loan guarantee will be used to finance the development of a new 64 thousand square foot community-serving retail space within the Vermont Manchester Transit Priority Project, a mixed-use development. The Vermont Manchester development will transform a 4.2-acre site that has been vacant since 1992. In addition to the retail development, the site will accommodate a charter boarding school focused on at-risk youth and financed separately from the other uses on the site. Considering the location of the site as one of the busiest transit stops in Los Angeles County, it will also include a transit plaza, as well as an improved pedestrian and cycling connection to the Silver Line bus rapid-transit station.
""The purpose of the Section 108 loan guarantee is to facilitate community development,"" said Arthur Jemison, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary, Office of Community Planning and Development at HUD. ""This opportunity highlights exactly how a community can benefit from HUD programs. This loan guarantee will provide the County of Los Angeles the necessary services to thrive.""
The loan guarantee assistance was awarded through the Section 108 Loan Guarantee Program (Section 108), which provides Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) recipients with the ability to leverage their annual grant allocation to access low-cost, flexible financing for economic development, housing, public facility, and infrastructure projects.
This project will meet the Community Development Block Grant national objective of benefit to low- and moderate-income persons on an area basis.
The Section 108 Loan Guarantee Program allows local governments to leverage 5 times their current CDBG award into federally guaranteed loans large enough to pursue physical and economic revitalization projects capable of redeveloping entire neighborhoods. Public investment, such as Section 108 loans, can spur private economic activity, providing the resources or the confidence that private firms and individuals may need to invest in distressed areas. Read more about HUD's Section 108 Loan Guarantee Program (www.hudexchange.info/programs/section-108/).
As the need for economic recovery and community development continues, HUD's Section 108 program serves as a critical source of federal financing that helps to move projects forward and build strong, sustainable, inclusive communities."

The two new guidance pieces, titled ""Guidance on Compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act in Marketing and Application Processing at Subsidized Multifamily Properties"" and ""Implementation Sheet for HUD's Title VI Guidance"" clarify how certain marketing, rental application processing, and waitlist management practices can perpetuate segregation or otherwise discriminate in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. The guidance is designed to assist property owners in understanding and implementing more inclusive practices less likely to produce discriminatory results.
""Housing receiving HUD subsidies must not be segregated on the basis of race, color, or national origin,"" said Demetria McCain, HUD Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""As we conclude Fair Housing Month, we are pleased to further help our partners construct processes that are inclusive of all.""
""Today's publication provides practical guidance to help property owners and managers to reach all members of their community,"" said Ethan Handelman, HUD Deputy Assistant Secretary for Multifamily Housing Programs. ""This is the latest step in the Department's work to support our program participants in their efforts to make affordable housing available without barriers.""
This guidance applies to the more than 1.5 million HUD-subsidized multifamily units nationwide, including Project-Based Rental Assistance, Section 202, and Section 811 subsidized units. Read the new Title VI marketing guidance here and the Implementation Sheet here.
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits intentional discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin in programs or activities receiving federal financial assistance, and practices that have an unjustified discriminatory effect.
The new guidance discusses marketing, rental application processing, and waitlist management practices that prevent eligible housing-seekers from accessing HUD-assisted housing opportunities. These practices may result in segregation or disparate outcomes based on race and national origin. The guidance informs housing providers about exclusionary practices to avoid and informs housing providers about inclusionary practices to employ to ensure meaningful opportunities for persons of all racial and national origin groups to learn about and participate in HUD-subsidized housing programs.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 877-8339 (Relay). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to hud.gov/fair housing."

The insured loan will help finance the construction of an $84 million transit-oriented development adjacent to the Metra commuter rail station situated a half mile east of Roselle's Main Street commercial district.
The mortgage was originated by Merchants Capital Corporation, and the development team is led by Avgeris and Associates. The developer utilized HUD's green/energy efficient housing incentive, the Green Mortgage Insurance Premium. It encourages applicants for FHA-insured mortgages to upgrade and maintain a property's energy performance in exchange for reduced FHA mortgage insurance premiums.
The five-story building is designed around a central courtyard, and amenities include a business office, fitness center, golf simulator, dog spa, outdoor pool, and enclosed rooftop lounge. Construction is scheduled to begin this year with leasing underway by 2024.
A redevelopment agreement formed public-private partnerships between HUD, the developer, the Village of Roselle, and Metra, the Regional Transportation Authority. This will allow the developer to construct a connected parking garage with 541 spaces for apartment residents and Metra commuters.

FHA's Office of Multifamily Housing plays an important role in the construction, substantial rehabilitation and refinance of market rate and affordable housing through the issuance of FHA mortgage insurance. These insurance programs provide stability, liquidity, and affordability to the multifamily housing market by providing credit during countercyclical times and in small markets. Fiscal year-to-date, the Office has insured 11,225 mortgages for 1.4 million homes with a total unpaid principal balance of $114 billion.
In fiscal year 2021, the Office of Multifamily Housing achieved record-breaking volume of $29.5 billion in initial endorsements for mortgage insurance. View quarterly and historical data on FHA Multifamily volume here."
04/22/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-076.cfm,"Fact Sheet - HUD Honors Earth Day with Announcement and Event, Reiterates Commitment to Tackling Climate Crisis","
Under the Biden-Harris Administration and the leadership of Secretary Marcia L. Fudge, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has taken significant action on a robust, cohesive, and agency-wide strategy to reduce the agency's energy and carbon footprint and put all our nation's communities on the path to building more equitable, efficient, and sustainable housing infrastructure. In November of 2021, HUD released its Climate Action Plan in response to President Biden's Executive Order on Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad (www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/27/executive-order-on-tackling-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad/).
In keeping with the executive order, as well as the President's Justice40 Initiative (www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/01/27/fact-sheet-president-biden-takes-executive-actions-to-tackle-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad-create-jobs-and-restore-scientific-integrity-across-federal-government/) to advance environmental justice and racial equity, HUD will continue to implement a broad approach to the climate crisis that reduces climate pollution; increases resilience to the impacts of climate change; protects public health; delivers environmental justice; and spurs well-paying union jobs and economic growth. In addition, HUD will work to allocate resources in a manner that addresses the historic failure of the Federal government (www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-advancing-racial-equity-and-support-for-underserved-communities-through-the-federal-government/) to invest equitably in underserved communities, particularly communities of color.
HUD Leadership Participates in Event in D.C.
HUD Deputy Secretary Adrianne Todman is commemorating the 52nd anniversary of Earth Day with a visit to Community Solar at Oxon Run, which will be the largest clean energy project in Washington, D.C. focused on serving neighborhood residents. Deputy Secretary Todman will underscore the Department's commitment to tackling the climate crisis and helping communities across the nation build more resilient infrastructure, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, create well-paid jobs, and pursue environmental justice. Deputy Secretary Todman will be joined by the District of Columbia's Department of Energy & Environment and will announce action HUD is taking in support of D.C.'s ""Solar for All"" initiative to ensure that D.C. residents of HUD-assisted Multifamily housing benefit from solar energy without experiencing increased housing costs.
HUD Action on Earth Day
D.C.'s ""Solar for All"" (https://doee.dc.gov/solarforall) initiative aims to bring the benefits of solar energy to 100,000 families with low to moderate incomes in the District of Columbia. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has determined that D.C. Solar for All's community-net-metering (CNM) credits will be excluded from household income and utility allowance calculations and therefore will not increase housing costs for residents in properties participating in HUD Multifamily rental assistance programs.
In a growing number of states, community solar helps ensure that low- to moderate-income renters and residents of multifamily buildings directly benefit from the transition to clean energy. HUD is well-positioned to advance the Biden-Harris Administration's Justice40 Initiative objectives, address climate concerns, and create benefits for residents of HUD assisted housing through the equitable deployment of community solar. As part of HUD's commitment to furthering more efficient, sustainable, and equitable housing, the Department will work with states to ensure that the benefits of such programs, like CA's Solar on Multifamily Affordable Housing program and DC's Solar for All program, flow to HUD residents. Localities considering similar solar energy programs can reach out to HUD to discuss how to best coordinate with the Department.
HUD's actions this week build on ongoing work at the Department to promote climate resilience, environmental justice, energy efficiency, and health across the housing sector.
Better Climate Challenge
In February, HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge joined Department of Energy Secretary Jennifer M. Granholm and White House National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy to announce the inaugural Better Climate Challenge, a private-public partnership led by DOE with over 80 American businesses and organizations that have signed on to ambitious carbon reduction goals. The Better Climate Challenge also encourages partners to share pathways to decarbonization among each other to multiply the impact of their innovative strategies to decarbonize. HUD supports the multifamily component of the Better Climate Challenge, one of several building sectors participating in the Challenge. Of the more than 80 inaugural partners who committed to the Challenge, seven were public housing or multifamily partners serving 40,000 low-and moderate-income households across the country. Through the Better Climate Challenge, HUD and DOE provide a national platform for organizations to make public commitments, share replicable solutions, including through the use of solar energy solutions, leverage technical expertise, and gain recognition.
Climate Action Plan
HUD's Climate Action Plan, released at the beginning of this fiscal year focuses on climate adaptation and resilience, greenhouse gas emissions reductions, and environmental justice. Highlights of the plan include the following:
• HUD Climate Communities Initiative: Cities and localities are on the front lines of the climate emergency, and low-income residents and people of color often bear more of the impact when climate-related disasters strike. HUD, in partnership with local leaders, launched a suite of resources, support, and tools to help cities respond to equitably the climate crisis. This includes a climate resilience toolkit (https://files.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/HUD-Community-Resilient-Toolkit.pdf), implementation models, peer-to-peer learning opportunities, stakeholder engagement with underserved communities, and direct support to a cohort of climate cities. You can find a lot of these resources and more on HUD Community Planning and Development's new site – Supporting Local Climate Action (www.hudexchange.info/programs/supporting-local-climate-action/). Along with the flexible block grant funding that local governments already receive, this concerted effort will help cities focus climate action on the needs of the most vulnerable and further climate justice.
• Mapping a Path Forward: We can't manage what we can't measure. HUD will undertake efforts to increase data availability related to building performance and energy usage, as well as data related to climate risk, both financial and physical, in HUD's portfolio. HUD is also announcing a commitment to the creation of an Equitable Decarbonization Roadmap. The roadmap will help establish a path for HUD's portfolio to meet the United States' climate commitment of reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, in a way that does not unduly burden low- and moderate-income households.
• Strengthening Resilience: HUD will continue to update CDBG-Disaster Recovery grant requirements to include a greater emphasis on climate mitigation, equity, and green building. Most recently, HUD published a Consolidated Notice for its 2020 and 2021 DR grantees. The Consolidated Notice seeks to advance equitable distribution of assistance, including planning for targeted assistance to residents of underserved communities, who have been historically marginalized and can be adversely affected by disasters that often exacerbate existing inequities. HUD is also updating its floodplain requirements, in alignment with the Federal Flood Risk Management Standard. It is also focused on sustainable disaster recovery efforts in communities across the country, including Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, and earlier this year, HUD joined with the Departments of Energy, Health and Human Services, and the Government of Puerto Rico to commit to sustainable rebuilding of the electric grid. Jurisdictions will be supported in these updated requirements with technical assistance from the Department.
• Green Building and Electrification: Too often, low-income households and communities of color are treated as an afterthought when it comes to advancing technology and green building. HUD will align building and substantial rehabilitation incentives and requirements, with energy efficiency and equitable decarbonization goals, including the requirement of new construction with new funds to achieve green building standards. HUD will also finalize rulemaking requiring strengthened minimum energy standards as required by statute. This will ensure that HUD-assisted households are not left behind as we shift to a low-carbon future.
• Good Green Jobs: HUD will strengthen partnerships with the Department of Labor, Department of Energy, Americorps and unions to ensure robust Green Jobs programs in the communities HUD serves, and will devote additional resources related to green workforce development training. In addition, HUD has recently launched the Building Futures pilot at two Public Housing sites. This pilot is designed to identify pathways to meaningful long-term employment in green jobs and construction industries for Public Housing residents.
• Healthy Housing: HUD will revise environmental review policies to ensure consideration of climate- and environmental justice-related hazards and health risks in all proposed site selection and placement of new assistance activities. HUD will also continue to collaborate with Local agencies and nongovernmental organizations to help the impacted community identify available resources and appropriate solutions to eliminate hazards and improve residents' overall health.
HUD will play a critical role in implementing the Biden Administration's climate agenda as it has significant influence over how the nation's households and communities will respond to the climate crisis.
HUD invests billions of dollars every year in housing, infrastructure, and services in neighborhoods across the US through its ever-increasing role in disaster relief and recovery. HUD's FHA-insured portfolio consists of over 7 million single family insured loans and approximately 11,000 multifamily insured loans in addition to residential healthcare facilities and hospitals. In its Multifamily program, FHA offers a ""green"" mortgage insurance premium which encourages applicants for FHA-insured mortgages to upgrade and maintain a property's energy performance in exchange for reduced FHA mortgage insurance premiums. HUD plays an essential role in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions due to its portfolio of approximately 4.5 million public and assisted housing units and its role in the development and preservation of affordable housing. According to an internal HUD analysis, yearly spending on utilities in public and assisted housing consumes as much as 14 percent of the agency's total budget and produces an estimated 13.6 million metric tons of carbon emissions. HUD is committed to improving the efficiency of public and assisted housing to lower carbon emissions and allow more funds to be spent on the provision of housing instead of on utilities.

04/26/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-078.cfm,HUD Charges Management and Owners of a Minnesota Apartment Building with Disability Discrimination,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that the agency charged Mark Frisch, Jennifer Costello, Major Management Company, and Larpenteur Estate Apartments, LLC, operators of a 220-unit apartment building in St. Paul, Minnesota, with discriminating against a prospective tenant based on disability by refusing to allow her assistance animal in the unit. Read the charge here.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination based on disability. This form of discrimination includes refusing to allow reasonable accommodations that would otherwise allow a tenant with a disability an equal opportunity to use and enjoy their housing. A reasonable accommodation includes a waiver of a ""no pet"" rule for assistance animals. The Act also prohibits statements that indicate a preference or limitation based on disability.
HUD's Charge of Discrimination alleges that the complainant attempted to rent a unit at the subject property for herself and her husband. However, after she notified Costello, the property manager, that she had an assistance animal, he said that she could not have an animal in the unit. He then suggested that she apply for an apartment somewhere else. The complainant further alleges that when she elevated the matter to Frisch, an owner of both the property and Major Management, he allegedly admonished her, saying that she should think of her neighbors who live at the property because it is ""animal-free"" and asked her why she did not ""go and find somewhere else to live."" She exclaimed, ""you are welcome, your animal is not!""
""Assistance animals provide people with disabilities the support they need to live comfortably in their home,"" said Demetria L. McCain, HUD Principal Assistant Deputy Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Today's action demonstrates HUD's ongoing commitment to take appropriate action when housing providers fail to comply with the Fair Housing Act.""
""The Fair Housing Act requires housing providers to provide accommodations that are reasonable and necessary, and that includes permitting the use of assistance animals,"" said HUD General Counsel Damon Smith. ""HUD is committed to vigorously enforcing the Act to protect the rights of individuals with disabilities.""
United States Administrative Law Judge will hear HUD's charge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds, after a hearing, that discrimination has occurred, they may award damages to the family for their losses as a result of the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, to deter further discrimination, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties to vindicate the public interest. If the federal court hears the case, the judge may also award punitive damages to the complainant.
People who believe they are the victims of housing discrimination should contact HUD at (800) 669-9777 (voice) 800-927-9275 (TTY) or the Department of Justice at (800) 896-7743 or 202-514-4713. Additional information is available at www.hud.gov/fairhousing and www.justice.gov."
04/26/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-079.cfm,HUD and Census Bureau Report New Residential Sales in March 2022,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Census Bureau jointly announced the following new residential sales statistics for March 2022:

New Home Sales
Sales of new single-family houses in March 2022 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 763,000, according to estimates released jointly today by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. This is 8.6 percent (±12.9 percent)* below the revised February rate of 835,000 and is 12.6 percent (±11. 3 percent)* below the March 2021 estimate of 873,000.
Sales Price
The median sales price of new houses sold in March 2022 was $436,700. The average sales price was $523,900.
For Sale Inventory and Months' Supply
The seasonally-adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of March was 407,000. This represents a supply of 6.4 months at the current sales rate.
Read more about new residential sales activity (www.census.gov/construction/nrs/index.html).
EXPLANATORY NOTES
These statistics are estimated from sample surveys. They are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated average relative standard errors of the preliminary data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. Changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show irregular movement. It takes 4 months to establish a trend for new houses sold. Preliminary new home sales figures are subject to revision due to the survey methodology and definitions used. The survey is primarily based on a sample of houses selected from building permits. Since a ""sale"" is defined as a deposit taken or sales agreement signed, this can occur prior to a permit being issued. An estimate of these prior sales is included in the sales figure. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimate of total sales is revised about 5.8 percent. Changes in sales price data reflect changes in the distribution of houses by region, size, etc., as well as changes in the prices of houses with identical characteristics. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau's website (www.census.gov/construction/nrs/how_the_data_are_collected/index.html).
* The 90 percent confidence interval includes zero. In such cases, there is insufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero."
04/27/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-080.cfm,HUD Approves Agreements with Hawaii Housing Providers Resolving Claims of Disability Discrimination,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has approved two Voluntary Compliance/Conciliation Agreements (Agreements) with EAH Inc. and other Artspace Lofts entities, to resolve complaints of disability discrimination.
The complaints alleged that the builders failed to design and construct, Ola Ka 'llima Artspace Lofts, an 84-unit building located in Honolulu, Hawaii, in accordance with the Fair Housing Act's requirements for accessible housing. The complaints also alleged that the building failed to comply with the accessibility requirements of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act. In addition, the complaints alleged that the respondents failed to provide reasonable accommodations and modifications for persons with disabilities. The housing providers are recipients of federal financial assistance. Read the Agreements (agreement one, agreement two).
The Fair Housing Act requires certain features of accessible design in all residential buildings with four or more units built after March 13, 1991, including, for example, accessible routes, wider doorways, and accessible and usable kitchens and bathrooms for persons who use wheelchairs. Section 504 requires recipients of federal financial assistance to provide at least the minimum number of designated accessible units that comply with the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards. In addition, Title II of the ADA requires public entities to ensure facilities are readily accessible and usable by individuals with disabilities, including through the removal of physical barriers. These federal laws also require the provision of reasonable accommodations and modifications for individuals with disabilities.
""It is imperative that housing is constructed in compliance with all applicable federal accessibility requirements,"" said Demetria L. McCain, HUD's Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""These Agreements are crafted to address both the complainants' concerns as well as other individuals with disabilities.""
Both complaints were filed by residents of Ola Ka 'llima Artspace Lofts, who are represented by the Legal Aid Society of Hawaii, a HUD Fair Housing Initiative Program organization. Both residents, one who uses a wheelchair and another who used a walker, alleged that the building was inaccessible to persons with disabilities. Specifically, they alleged that the building failed to have accessible building entrances and exits, accessible parking and garage entrances, accessible doors in common and public use areas, accessible bathrooms and kitchens, and accessible light switches, among other things. The residents asked the housing providers to address the inaccessibility, but the resident manager allegedly declined to do so, telling one that she would have to pay for any retrofits herself.
The housing providers have agreed to pay the two residents who filed complaints $25,000 collectively and to create a ""Fair Housing Aloha Accessibility Fund"" by depositing $30,000 into an interest-bearing escrow account for the purpose of paying damages to other persons who may have been injured by inaccessibility at the property. The housing providers also agreed to hire third-party independent accessibility consultants to conduct accessibility surveys, complete a needs assessment, self-evaluation, and transition plan to ensure that the entire property is in full compliance will all applicable federal accessibility requirements. Based upon the outcomes of the surveys and assessments, the housing providers will make retrofits to the property that will include modifications to individual units to make them fully accessible and useable by residents with disabilities. The Agreements do not constitute admissions by the housing providers or evidence of a final determination by HUD of violations of the Fair Housing Act or any other laws.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 877-8339 (Relay). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to hud.gov/fairhousing."

Fudge, Schumer, Bowman & Hochul Announce Fed Closing of Co-Op City's HUD Loan Refinance; State and Local Government Backing Supports Re-Fi to Provide Immediate Injection of Over $100 Million Dollars to Make Repairs & Critical Investments in World's Largest Housing Cooperative","WASHINGTON - United States Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia L. Fudge, U.S. Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer, Congressman Jamaal Bowman, and Governor Kathy Hochul announced today that Riverbay Corporation, the management company for Co-op City, HUD, Wells Fargo, the Mortgage Insurance Fund of the State of New York Mortgage Agency, and NYC Housing Development Corporation closed on the refinancing of Co-op City's HUD loan, which will maintain long-term housing quality and affordability for the over 45,000 residents. Refinancing provides the housing company with $124 million in proceeds that will be used for capital improvements, including upgrades to the HVAC, façade maintenance, and electrical systems.
""We applaud the successful completion of the refinance for the Bronx's Co-op City Complex,"" said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""The Biden-Harris Administration and HUD are committed to stabilizing the housing market nationwide using every tool at our disposal, including utilizing Federal Housing Administration multifamily mortgage insurance as a key financing source. From supporting larger loans in major metropolitan areas to smaller loans in rural communities and suburbs, HUD is proud to be a partner in creating and preserving affordable housing across the country.""
""One of HUD's top priorities is the preservation of affordable housing, and this refinancing ensures Co-op City remains affordable for thousands of families,"" said Alicka Ampry-Samuel, HUD Regional Administrator for New York and New Jersey. ""It is also crucial that this development remain safe and residents continue to live in updated, quality units, made possible by HUD FHA's influx of funds. Co-op City families will benefit from these improvements and will be able to enjoy their community for many years to come.""
""The Bronx's Co-op City provides an affordable home to more than 45,000 New Yorkers in an increasingly expensive housing market,"" said U.S. Senator Charles Schumer. ""That's why I worked to secure a timely refinance agreement for Co-op City, which will help maintain the quality, viability and long-term affordability of this one-of-a-kind community. The deal will also improve the lives of the residents by allowing repairs and other improvements to be made, all while providing affordable housing for generations to come. We haven't stopped pushing and working with HUD to lock in the refinance and we are proud to announce its closure.""
""Co-op City is truly a one-of-a-kind community, home to the largest affordable housing cooperative in America and more than 45,000 constituents that I am honored to serve,"" said Congressman Jamaal Bowman Ed.D (NY-16). ""It is imperative that the Co-op City community has the funds needed to maintain their affordable housing and commercial space, which supports all who live there. I am proud to have worked alongside the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development under Secretary Fudge's leadership, Majority Leader Schumer, and Governor Hochul to advance a timely refinance agreement for Riverbay Corp, which will unlock significant capital funds for urgent repairs. Co-op City is a prime example of what cooperative housing can look like across this nation and I look forward to seeing how this loan refinance will continue to support making this community even more sustainable, livable and affordable.""
""My administration is committed to maintaining access to safe, quality affordable housing that enables New Yorkers to live with the dignity they deserve,"" Governor Kathy Hochul said. ""This transformative injection of capital funding will allow us to modernize Co-op City, the largest housing cooperative in the world, and ensure long-term affordability for its 45,000 residents.""
""This loan will assist us to maintain our buildings and infrastructure while reducing the need for our residents to pay huge fee increases,"" said Co-op City Board President Bernard Cylich. ""On behalf of the Board of Directors and residents, I want to thank all of the government agencies and elected officials who have supported us and worked together to get this loan closed.
""Wells Fargo is pleased to have again structured the long term financing for Co-op City,"" said Alan Wiener, Head of Multi Family Capital for Wells Fargo. ""Our commitment to providing long term financing for affordable and moderate income housing is unparalleled in the industry. We would like to congratulate our elected partners Senator Schumer, Representative Bowman and Governor Hochul, as well as our agency partners at HUD, New York State, and New York City who worked with us to make this possible.""
""I am enormously proud of this partnership that will protect affordable homeownership at Co-op City for another 35 years,"" said Homes and Community Renewal Commissioner RuthAnne Visnauskas. ""In addition to keeping maintenance fees stable for residents, the $621.5 million loan will finance much-needed capital repair projects to ensure that all 15,372 homes remain safe and secure for the long term. Generations of New Yorkers have benefitted from the ability to live affordably in this bustling and diverse community while building equity to pass down to their children. Thanks to our private and public partners, Co-op City will continue to deliver economic opportunities for the Bronx's hard-working families for decades to come.""
""The refinancing of Co-op City represents a critical investment in our existing affordable housing stock at a time of urgent need,"" said HDC President Eric Enderlin. ""Thanks to the collaboration of our partners and elected officials, this preservation effort will ensure lasting affordability and extensive capital repairs that will provide housing stability and improved quality of life to the thousands of New Yorkers that reside in this dynamic community.""
The 2012 Wells Fargo mortgage loan to Riverbay Corporation, which owns Co-op City, was the largest ever insured under the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Sec. 223(f) program, which protects lenders against loss on mortgage defaults at multifamily properties.
The restructured $621.5 million mortgage loan from Wells Fargo extends the term of affordability for an additional ten years and provides $124 million for the cooperative to undertake necessary capital repairs. With 15,372 homes, Co-op City is the largest cooperative housing development in the world. The Mortgage Insurance Fund of the State of New York Mortgage Agency, which is part of New York State Homes and Community Renewal, and the New York City's Housing Development Corporation, will provide credit support with $55 million and $15 million coverage of the loan, respectively. The loan includes $15 million for immediate capital repairs, including approximately $10 million for balcony and façade repair, $2.5 million for the replacement of residential water pumps and $2.5 million for the replacement of garage elevators. The loan also includes $109 million to replenish a reserve account for future repairs, all without raising maintenance charges for residents.
Co-op City is home to over 45,000 residents on 320 acres - the single largest co-op development in the country. The site has multiple schools, three commercial malls, and its own power plant. It has provided tens of thousands of families the opportunity to grow up in a stable middle-class community. This refinancing arrangement will help ensure tens of thousands more have that same opportunity and provide proceeds to make capital investments that will benefit residents for years to come.
The New York City Housing Development Corporation (HDC) is the nation's largest municipal Housing Finance Agency and is charged with helping to finance the creation or preservation of affordable housing for New Yorkers. HDC also serves as a key financing partner in the rehabilitation of our city's public housing stock under the NYCHA Permanent Affordability Commitment Together (PACT) initiative. Since 2003, HDC has financed more than 201,000 housing units using over $28 billion in bonds and other debt obligations and provided in excess of $3 billion in subsidy from corporate reserves and other available funds held by the corporation.

The transaction, which closed on April 7, 2022, provides FHA insurance on a $79.7 refinance transaction through Armadale Capital Health Care Mortgage Corporation under FHA's Section 223(f) program and facilitates continued access to quality healthcare for South Carolinians in Providence and Camden, SC. Doing business as Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) Health, the organization is the second largest hospital system in South Carolina with 2,226 licensed beds throughout its 14 facilities.
The transaction is a refinance of MUSC Health short-term debt which will reduce costs for MUSC Health related to Providence Hospital Downtown and Providence Hospital Northeast in Providence, SC, and Kershaw Health in Camden, SC, which MUSC Health acquired in 2021. Combined, the three hospitals are projected to serve over 12,000 patients in 2022.
Providence Health Downtown is a 258-bed acute care hospital and Providence Hospital Northeast is a 74-bed acute care hospital with a free-standing emergency room. Kershaw Health includes a 119-bed acute care hospital, with 20 licensed beds specifically for geriatric psychiatry.
MUSC Health hospital facilities have been in the FHA Section 242 Mortgage Insurance for Hospital Facilities portfolio since 2004 with a $401 million FHA-insured mortgage used for the construction of the seven-story Ashley River Tower diagnostic center in Charleston, SC. In subsequent years, FHA has insured three additional mortgages for MUSC Health, including a $316 million FHA-insured mortgage in 2016 for the Shawn Jenkins Children's Hospital in Charleston, SC.
About FHA's Section 242/223(f) Mortgage Insurance for Hospital Facilities Program
FHA's Office of Hospital Facilities (OHF) manages the Section 242 program, which provides mortgage insurance for acute care hospital facilities ranging from large teaching institutions to small rural critical access hospitals. FHA's Section 242/223(f) program provides options for hospitals wishing to refinance existing loans without new construction or major rehabilitation. As of February 2022, FHA has active insurance on 88 mortgages for hospital facilities across the country with a total unpaid principal balance of $6.5 billion."
04/29/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-084.cfm,HUD Charges Developers of St. Louis Apartment Complex with Disability Discrimination for Failure to Design and Construct Accessible Dwellings,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is charging LJLD, LLC, d/b/a Debrecht Properties or Debrecht Property (LJLD), and Westminster Properties, LLC (Westminster), the developers and original owners of the Bridgewater Residences, an 84-unit apartment complex in St. Louis, Missouri, with failure to design and construct the complex's covered dwellings and public and common use areas so that they are accessible to people with disabilities, in violation of the Fair Housing Act. HUD's charge also names the current owner, Bridgewater Apartments V, LLC, as a necessary party to permit and facilitate the property's retrofitting for accessibility. Read the charge here.
The Fair Housing Act requires multifamily housing built after March 1991 to have seven basic accessibility features for persons with disabilities, including persons using wheelchairs. These features include accessible building entrances on accessible routes, accessible public and common use areas, usable doors, accessible routes into and through covered dwellings, accessible environmental controls, reinforced walls in bathrooms to allow installation of grab bars, and usable kitchens and bathrooms. Failure to include these features is unlawful and makes housing difficult or impossible to use by people with disabilities.
""When developers fail to include accessibility features in housing, they deny people with disabilities equal housing opportunities,"" said Demetria L. McCain, HUD's Principal Deputy Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Such a denial not only harms an entire class of people, it is illegal.""
""There is no excuse, three decades after the Fair Housing Act required newly constructed multifamily housing to contain basic accessibility features, for builders and designers not to include them,"" said Damon Smith, HUD's General Counsel. ""The Department will vigorously enforce the Fair Housing Act to ensure builders and designers meet their accessibility obligations.""
The case came to HUD's attention when Metropolitan St. Louis Equal Housing and Opportunity Council (EHOC), a partner in HUD's Fair Housing Initiatives Program, filed a complaint with HUD after conducting testing at Bridgewater Residences shortly after the complex was completed in 2016. This testing indicated that the apartment complex failed to meet the Act's design and construction requirements. HUD then conducted two inspections of its own. HUD's Charge of Discrimination alleges that LJLD and Westminster failed to design and construct the 28 ground-floor apartments at Bridgewater Residences, as well as its public and common use areas, in accordance with the Act's requirements. According to the Charge, the inaccessible features at the complex include doors too narrow to allow passage by a person using a wheelchair, routes with steep slopes and inaccessible curbs, bathrooms and kitchens that lack sufficient space for a wheelchair, inaccessible public and common use areas, and building entrances that can only be accessed via stairs.
A United States Administrative Law Judge will hear HUD's charge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he or she may award damages to the complainant for its loss as a result of the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, to deter further discrimination, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties in order to vindicate the public interest. If the case is heard in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages to the complainant.
People who believe they are the victims of housing discrimination should contact HUD at (800) 669-9777 (voice) (800) 927-9275 (TTY) or the Department of Justice at (800) 896-7743 or (202) 514-4713. Additional information is available at www.hud.gov/fairhousing and www.justice.gov."
05/03/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-085.cfm,"On One-Year Anniversary of Innovative ""Faircloth-to-RAD"" Initiative, HUD on Track to Create Nearly 1,850 New Affordable Housing Units","WASHINGTON - This week, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) commemorated the first anniversary of the creation of the ""Faircloth-to-RAD"" initiative, a new pathway that allows Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) to leverage their ""Faircloth Authority"" to create new deeply affordable rent-assisted housing through the Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD).
""This Administration is using every tool available to address the shortage of affordable housing across the country, especially for the lowest-income families,"" said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""As we mark the one-year anniversary of this initiative, I applaud what our Department has accomplished to secure new, deeply affordable housing options for hundreds of families, and I look forward to serving more communities in the months to come.""
""Faircloth-to-RAD"" conversions result in new housing units that are affordable to the lowest-income families, elderly persons, and persons with disabilities. The initiative supports the Biden-Harris Administration's objectives to increase the availability of affordable rental housing specifically for these populations. In one year, HUD has 34 projects in the Faircloth-to-RAD pipeline, which will eventually create 1,847 deeply affordable rental homes. Five of these projects are currently under construction. Two projects, in Miami, FL and Baltimore, MD, have completed construction and have begun to welcome new residents.
""From supporting new, affordable multifamily construction in Miami, FL, to helping to rebuild hurricane-damaged public housing units in Galveston, TX, Faircloth-to-RAD has been a critical and innovative tool to create brand new, deeply affordable housing for the nation's vulnerable populations in America,"" said Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Housing Lopa P. Kolluri.
The impact of the Faircloth-to-RAD initiative is becoming visible across the nation. With Faircloth-to-RAD, the Housing Authority of Miami-Dade County, FL was able to integrate 27 deeply affordable homes into a new 161 unit mixed-income community called Brisas Del Rio. In Washington, DC, Faircloth-to-RAD enabled the D.C. Housing Authority to commit 101 affordable ""Faircloth-to-RAD"" homes for low-income seniors at Kenilworth 166. In Galveston, TX, the Housing Authority of the City of Galveston is using Faircloth-to-RAD for the rebuilding of Oleander at Broadway, a 419-unit community that is returning 174 rent-assisted ""Faircloth-to-RAD"" homes that were severely damaged from Hurricane Ike in 2008.
About Faircloth-to-RAD
The Faircloth limit is a cap that Congress established in 1998 on the number of public housing units the Federal government supports. However, many PHAs operate fewer rent-assisted units than they are authorized under their ""Faircloth"" limit. Nationwide, HUD estimates that public housing inventory could be expanded by nearly 235,000 units if PHAs had access to capital to acquire or construct this new housing. A Faircloth-to-RAD strategy allows PHAs to tap into this opportunity to create more affordable housing by using RAD to establish a long-term, reliable rental subsidy contract for new housing units, helping PHAs and their partners more readily finance the development of affordable rental homes.
The Faircloth-to-RAD pathway represents an innovative solution to activate this existing Federal authority to create affordable housing and is one of many ways that RAD helps provide important new tools that PHAs can use to improve their communities.
About RAD
RAD was designed to help address the multi-billion-dollar nationwide backlog of deferred maintenance in the public housing portfolio and to stem the loss of affordable housing that could no longer be kept to decent standards. From the program's inception through April 1, 2022, the Rental Assistance Demonstration has facilitated more than $14.5 billion in capital investment to improve or replace nearly 175,000 deeply rent-assisted homes, most of which house extremely low-income families, seniors, and persons with disabilities.
Under RAD, projects funded under the public housing program convert their public housing assistance to project-based Section 8 rental assistance. Under Section 8, as with public housing, residents pay 30% of their income towards rent and the housing must continue to serve those with very low and extremely low incomes. Residents must be notified and consulted prior to conversion and are given a right to return to assisted housing post-construction so that the same tenants can enjoy these newly preserved and improved apartments and maintain the same fundamental rights they had as public housing residents.

05/05/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-086.cfm,Federal Housing Administration Takes Additional Steps to Expand Affordable Housing Supply Through FHA's Claims Without Conveyance of Title,"WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) announced on Thursday that it published Mortgagee Letter (ML) 2022-08, Expanding Affordable Housing Supply Through FHA's Claims Without Conveyance of Title. The ML adds an initial 30-day exclusive sales period for Claims Without Conveyance of Title (CWCOT) post-foreclosure sales for owner-occupants, HUD-approved nonprofits, and governmental entities. The 30-day exclusive period gives these specified buyers an opportunity to bid on foreclosed properties before investors are allowed to bid during the CWCOT post-foreclosure sales period. The ML also extends the mortgagee's conveyance timeframe to provide these buyers additional time to obtain financing and complete the sale.
On September 1, 2021, President Biden announced (www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/09/01/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-immediate-steps-to-increase-affordable-housing-supply/) steps HUD would take to make more single family homes available to individuals, families, and nonprofits rather than large investors by prioritizing homeownership and creating exclusive listing or bidding periods for targeted buyers. This change to FHA's CWCOT program directly supports that goal.
""This policy change is critical as the nation continues to address the challenges of a real estate market in which home prices are high and the availability of affordable housing supply is low, making it difficult for individuals and families to achieve the dream of homeownership,"" said Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Housing and the Federal Housing Administration Lopa P. Kolluri.
Mortgagees will be required to report the Delinquency/Default Status (DDS) Codes that apply to the CWCOT or CWCOT Post-Foreclosure Sale at the end of each reporting cycle in the Single Family Default Monitoring System (SFDMS). The updated SFDMS Reporting Codes and Reporting Data Elements document will be available on the Single Family Housing Policy Handbook 4000.1 Supplemental Documents web page.
The provisions of the ML may be used immediately, but must be used for all post- foreclosure sales associated with defaulted FHA-insured Mortgages scheduled to occur on or after 90 days from the publication date of the ML.
About FHA's Claims Without Conveyance of Title Program
CWCOT is an FHA claim option through which insurance benefits are paid to a mortgagee after the sale of the property to a third-party purchaser at foreclosure of the FHA-insured mortgage or through post-foreclosure sales efforts. This means there is no conveyance of the property to the HUD in exchange for payment of the mortgage insurance benefit."
05/05/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-087.cfm,HUD Charges Puerto Rico Property Owners and Real Estate Agent with Discriminating Against Person with Disabilities,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is charging Josefina Amparo De La Fuente-Mundo, Alicia De La Fuente-Mundo, and Rosalia De La Fuente-Mundo, owners and manager of an apartment building in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Maria Trini Menendez, the real estate agent hired to rent a unit in the building, with housing discrimination for allegedly refusing to rent to a person with disabilities because she uses a service animal. Read HUD's Charge.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination based on disability. This includes refusing to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services, when necessary to allow a person with disabilities to use and enjoy their housing. Reasonable accommodations include a waiver of a ""no pet"" policy for service animals.
""Service animals allow people with disabilities to perform life's daily activities and maintain their independence,"" said Demetria L. McCain, HUD Principal Assistant Deputy Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Today's action demonstrates HUD's ongoing commitment to take appropriate action when housing providers fail to comply with the Fair Housing Act.""
""Housing providers are required to allow people with disabilities the use of service animals that they need to fully enjoy their housing,"" said Damon Smith, HUD General Counsel. ""HUD is committed to vigorously enforcing the Fair Housing Act to protect the rights of individuals with disabilities.""
HUD's Charge of Discrimination alleges that the complainant, who is legally blind, attempted to rent a unit at the subject property for herself and her partner. During the tour of the property, the complainant told Ms. Menendez of her disability and of her need for a guide dog as a service animal. In response, Ms. Menendez told the complainant that she could not have a pet in the unit because the owners have a no pet policy at the subject property. According to the Charge, the complainant explained that refusing to permit a service animal could be grounds for a lawsuit and suggested that Ms. Menendez speak to the owner of the property. When Ms. Menendez raised the issue with Josefina De La Fuente-Mundo, Ms. De La Fuente-Mundo reiterated that pets are not permitted in the building. Ms. Menendez relayed this to the complainant and suggested other potential rentals.
A United States Administrative Law Judge will hear HUD's Charge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds, after a hearing, that discrimination has occurred, the judge may award damages to the complainant for the harm caused by the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, to deter further discrimination, as well as payment of attorney's fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties to vindicate the public interest. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages to the complainant.

05/06/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-089.cfm,"Statement from Secretaries Fudge, McDonough, Vilsack and Yellen on continued efforts to connect homeowners to pandemic relief","WASHINGTON - The Secretaries of Housing and Urban Development Marcia L. Fudge, Veterans Affairs Denis McDonough, Agriculture Tom Vilsack and Treasury Janet L. Yellen are calling on servicers of federally backed mortgages to make every effort to ensure no individual or family unduly experiences unnecessary hardship or foreclosure while assistance is available under the Homeowner Assistance Fund (https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/coronavirus/assistance-for-state-local-and-tribal-governments/homeowner-assistance-fund).
The pandemic's economic and public health impacts put millions of homeowners at risk of losing their homes. For this reason, President Biden's American Rescue Plan (www.whitehouse.gov/american-rescue-plan/) established HAF to provide close to $10 billion in financial support to help families weather these challenges and remain in their homes.
We are strongly urging all servicers of federally backed mortgages to pause foreclosure proceedings when they are notified by a HAF program administrator of a pending HAF application to avoid unnecessary harm to vulnerable homeowners. Pausing any pending proceedings is a vital step towards keeping families in their homes as they receive assistance through the HAF program and is consistent with Congress's intent in putting in place the HAF program to protect vulnerable homeowners.
During any such pause, we encourage homeowners and servicers to continue working together on loss mitigation options to ensure vulnerable homeowners eligible for assistance are able to choose the best path to staying in their homes and fully utilize available resources. We also strongly encourage servicers to offer these loss mitigation options to borrowers who are struggling to make their mortgage payments, including those who are eligible for HAF funding.
Treasury urges HAF program administrators to take steps to ensure their programs expedite handling of applications from homeowners with pending foreclosure proceedings, including determining the homeowner's eligibility for HAF and in all communications with the servicer regarding the homeowner's application. Treasury also encourages HAF programs to develop expedited procedures for handling homeowners with immediate threats to housing stability and to support homeowners who may benefit from the agencies' loss mitigation options. This support can include providing homeowners with access to housing counseling agencies approved by HUD or a Tribal government as well as legal services. Additionally, Treasury has encouraged collaboration between HAF programs and its servicers to develop infrastructure to support timely and accurate communication about programs and between servicers.
In addition to urging servicers to make HAF funding available to homeowners, our Departments have taken a number of actions to ensure homeowners have the support needed to recover. We will continue to explore updates to our loss mitigation home retention options for servicers to utilize as part of an administration-wide approach to help families who are behind on housing payments due to the economic impacts of the pandemic.

HUD, VA and USDA have published updates to their HAF Frequently Asked Questions for FHA-insured mortgages and VA and USDA home loans to include guidance that servicers should pause foreclosure actions while HAF applications are pending.

HUD's announcement comes as part of the Biden-Harris Administration's announcement of a ""whole-of-government outreach effort"" to drive enrollment in the ACP (www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/09/fact-sheet-president-biden-and-vice-president-harris-reduce-high-speed-internet-costs-for-millions-of-americans/), which will help lower the cost of broadband for eligible households and expand access to reliable services for rural, urban, and suburb and Tribal communities across the country. Households receiving HUD rental assistance qualify for ACP subsidies, but families need to enroll in the program in order to receive the benefit.
""The pandemic has further highlighted a known divide in access to broadband and its importance in daily life,"" said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""We are deeply committed to ensuring that communities have the necessary resources to thrive, especially when it comes to accessing reliable and affordable broadband coverage. With today's action, we are making it clear that eligible HUD households can get the financial help they need to equitably access broadband without losing access to critical HUD programs.""
HUD is supporting the Administration's effort through outreach to HUD partners designed to increase resident participation in the ACP by informing HUD households that ACP does not count as income for determining family rent or impact eligibility for HUD households. Specifically, HUD is:
Providing more than 3,000 Public Housing Authorities with information about the Affordable Connectivity Program to share with their more than 3 million families; Providing over 547 Tribes and Tribally Designated Housing Entities; and Providing information about the Affordable Connectivity Program to Project-Based Rental Assistance owners who house more than 1 million families.

• Providing over 547 Tribes and Tribally Designated Housing Entities; and

As part of its announcement, the Biden-Harris Administration has secured commitments from a set of large and small internet providers to offer high-speed broadband prices at $30 a month or less, enabling tens of millions of low-income households eligible for the ACP to get high-speed internet access at no charge. The Administration has also created a new website—GetInternet.gov—with details on how Americans can sign up for ACP and find participating internet providers in their area. This effort reflects the Administration's commitment to expanding equitable access to reliable, high-speed, and affordable broadband coverage to all Americans.
The $14 billion Affordable Connectivity Program discounts up to $30 per month toward broadband service for eligible households and up to $75 per month for qualifying households on qualifying Tribal lands. The benefit also provides up to a $100 per household discount toward a one-time purchase of a computer, laptop, or tablet if the household contributes more than $10 and less than $50 toward the purchase through a participating broadband provider. Click here (www.fcc.gov/acp) for information on program eligibility.
Affordable Connectivity Program enrollment opened on December 31, 2021. Eligible households can enroll through a participating broadband provider (www.fcc.gov/affordable-connectivity-program-providers) or by (1) going to ACPBenefit.org to submit an online application or print a mail-in application and (2) contacting their preferred participating broadband provider and selecting a plan. Additional information about the Affordable Connectivity Program is available at www.fcc.gov/ACP (www.fcc.gov/acp) or by calling 877-384-2575 between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. ET."
05/09/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-091.cfm,HUD Expands Eviction Protection and Diversion Program With Additional $20 Million,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) on Monday announced $20 million in new grants for its Eviction Protection Grant Program, doubling the amount originally allocated for the launch of the Program in November 2021.
HUD has offered grants to 11 organizations, in addition to the 10 organizations selected in November, to help non-profits and governmental entities provide legal assistance to low-income tenants at risk of or subject to eviction. Legal services are integral in helping individuals and families, especially people of color who are disproportionately represented among those evicted, people with limited English proficiency and people with disabilities, avoid eviction or minimize the disruption and damage caused by the eviction process.
""The American people have been resilient in the face of historic challenges as we continue to confront the impacts of COVID-19,"" said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""We need to keep doing all that we can to help people maintain quality housing. We know that access to legal services and eviction diversion programs works. It helps people avoid evictions and protects tenants' rights. Legal services also help landlords access available resources to address rent arrears. We are proud to expand the Eviction Protection Grant Program so that more families have access to eviction protection services.""
Through HUD's Office of Policy Development and Research, these competitive grants were made available to legal service providers serving or expanding services in areas with high rates of eviction or prospective evictions, including rural areas. The first cohort of grantees funded by the program are implementing a total of seven statewide programs (Connecticut, Florida, Idaho, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana, and Utah) as well as two regional (Northwestern Ohio and Western New York) and three local (Albany, Atlanta, and Las Vegas) programs. This expansion will support additional statewide, regional, and local programs across the Northeast, Southern, and Western United States.
HUD plans to award grants to the following non-profit and governmental legal services providers:
The Eviction Protection Grant Program is part of HUD's continued work, as part of a whole of government approach, to support families recovering from the public health and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. State and local Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) grantees have made over 5.2 million payments to households and spent or committed well over $30 billion in rental and utility assistance, along with other support through the program. Additionally, state and local governments have already used Fiscal Recovery Funds provided by the American Rescue Plan to provide additional rent, mortgage, or utility assistance to over 700,000 households and have provided eviction prevention services to more than 100,000 households in 2021. And due to the Administration's continual promotion of eviction diversion programs, including through multiple eviction prevention summits in 2021, there are now approximately 100 eviction diversion programs in existence nationwide. As a result of these efforts, the Eviction Lab estimated that millions of renters avoided the threat of eviction in 2021.
Background
One of the leading interventions to prevent evictions is providing legal assistance to at-risk tenants. Research shows that legal representation helps tenants remain housed while also delivering financial savings to the jurisdictions. For example, a study in Baltimore found that an annual investment of $5.7 million in a right to counsel program would yield $35.6 million in benefits or costs avoided to the city and state. (Stout Risius Ross, LLC. May 8, 2020. The Economic Impact of an Eviction Right to Counsel in Baltimore City).
A right to counsel in eviction proceedings has consistently been found to significantly reduce evictions (Eviction Right to Counsel Resource Center (www.stout.com/en/services/transformative-change-consulting/eviction-right-to-counsel-resources)). A study in Minnesota found fully represented tenants win or settle their cases 96 percent of the time and clients receiving limited representation win or settle their cases 83 percent of the time. These figures compare with just 62 percent of tenants without any representation. Tenants with full representation were twice as likely to stay in their homes or got twice as much time to move, left court without an eviction record, and were four times less likely to use homeless shelters (Grundman & Kruger, 2018, Legal Representation in Evictions - Comparative Study (www.minnpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/2018-Eviction-Representation-Results-Study-with-logos.pdf)). An analysis of California's Shriver Housing Pilot Projects found clients with full representation were significantly less likely to end their cases by default (8 percent) than were self-represented defendants (26 percent) and on average had more days to move, were ordered less often to pay holdover damages, landlord attorney fees, and other costs (NPC Research, 2017).

May marks National Foster Care Month, a time to renew the commitment to ensuring all young people who are or have been in foster care have the support and resources they need to thrive.
""The Foster Youth to Independence initiative fills a longstanding gap in support for young people who are transitioning out of foster care,"" said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""I am proud of the award-winning Foster Youth to Independence program, which provides stability and hope to young people aging out of foster care. During National Foster Care Month, we recognize the challenges young people face in the foster care system and recommit to improving housing outcomes for our nation's foster youth.""
In October 2021, HUD's Foster Youth to Independence team was awarded the prestigious 2021 Samuel J. Heyman Service to America Medal (""Sammies"") for the creation and management of the innovative FYI program, which has achieved significant accomplishments in efficient, effective, and results-oriented government.
Over the past year, the Foster Youth to Independence Initiative has awarded $12.7 million in 45 states to provide 18- to 24-year-olds who are aging out or have aged out of foster care with rental assistance and other supportive services so they can work toward their educational and employment goals and reach self-sufficiency.
In January, HUD published a notice in the Federal Register implementing and providing guidance on Fostering Stable Housing Opportunities (FSHO). Under FSHO, foster youth will be able to receive up to an additional 24 months of voucher assistance, for a maximum of 60 months. The program also provides supportive services.
The funding awarded today will provide up housing vouchers and assist youth in accessing housing stability. To be eligible for FYI funding, public housing authorities must:
Administer a Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) Program; Enter into a partnership agreement with a Public Child Welfare Agency (PCWA); Accept young people referred by their partnering PCWA; and Determine that the referred youth are eligible for HCV assistance.

05/16/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-095.cfm,Secretary Fudge Highlights Biden-Harris Administration Actions to Increase Affordable Housing Supply and Lower Housing Costs,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Marcia L. Fudge on Monday traveled to Columbus, Ohio to announce actions in the Biden-Harris Administration Action Plan to Ease the Burden of Housing Costs (www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/16/president-biden-announces-new-actions-to-ease-the-burden-of-housing-costs/). The Plan is a set of legislative and administrative steps to close the housing supply gap within the next five years.
Secretary Fudge highlighted the Plan at an affordable housing development that is under construction in Columbus, Ohio. She was joined by U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown, U.S. Congresswoman Joyce Beatty, and Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther.
""The Housing Supply Action Plan is the latest step HUD, and the Biden-Harris Administration are taking to expand our nation's supply of affordable housing,"" said Secretary Fudge. ""This plan will ease costs for families across the country and give communities the tools they need to make more affordable housing available to residents.""
Under the Plan - which builds on the steps the Administration announced (www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/09/01/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-immediate-steps-to-increase-affordable-housing-supply/) last September to build and rehabilitate 100,000 homes over the next three years - the Administration will reward jurisdictions that have reformed zoning and land-use policies; deploy new financing mechanisms to build and preserve more housing where financing gaps currently exist; expand and improve existing forms of federal financing; ensure that more government-owned supply of homes and other housing goes to owners who will live in them; work with private sector to address supply chain challenges and finish construction in 2022 on the most new homes in any years since 2006.
HUD will play a central role in carrying out these actions, including through the following immediate next steps:
Supporting production and availability of manufactured housing. HUD is making it easier to finance new units and helping manufacturers update their designs to meet changing consumer demands. This includes working to increase the usability of FHA's Title I loan program for Manufactured Housing, supporting greater securitization of Title I loans through Ginnie Mae's platform, updating the HUD Code to allow manufacturers to modernize and expand their production lines, and helping manufacturers respond to supply chain issues. Advancing HOME as a key tool for the production and preservation of affordable rental and homeownership housing. HUD will update guidance to strengthen the HOME Investment Partnerships Program. Through the reauthorization of HOME, updated guidance, and robust technical assistance, HUD will advance and streamline this critical resource for the creation of affordable rental housing and promotion of homeownership. Continuing to drive housing production through the Federal Financing Bank's Risk Sharing Program. Last September, the Administration announced that Treasury and HUD had finalized an agreement to restart the Federal Financing Bank's Risk Sharing program. The program provides loans at reduced interest rates to state and local housing finance agencies to create and preserve high-quality, affordable homes. Twenty-two state agencies have been approved to use FFB, and HUD has committed to guarantee more than $1.3 billion in loans representing more than 7,100 affordable units. HUD will work in the months ahead to accelerate this work by encouraging more state and local HFAs to participate and explore the development of a permanent financing mechanism for these loans through Ginnie Mae's securitization platform. Improving the alignment of federal funds to reduce transaction costs and duplications and accelerate development. To reduce transaction costs and duplication, and to speed development, the Administration will make changes to harmonize federal requirements across programs as much as possible - including through programs like HUD's LIHTC Pilot Program, which streamlines FHA processing of mortgage insurance applications for projects with LIHTC equity. To encourage alignment of affordable housing subsidies, the White House, HUD, Treasury, and USDA will convene state housing agencies to discuss best practices on the alignment of applications, reviews, and funding. Supporting new and existing affordable housing in Indian Country. HUD will award Indian Housing Block Grant (IHBG) funding to Tribes and Tribally Designated Housing Entities to finance the construction of new affordable housing in Indian Country, and also make historic levels of annual IHBG formula funding available to them. Directing supply to owner-occupants and mission-driven entities instead of large investors. Earlier this month, FHA announced it is expanding its Claims Without Conveyance of Title Process (CWCOT) to include the establishment of an initial exclusive Post-Foreclosure Sales Period for owner-occupant buyers, HUD approved non-profit, and governmental entities. FHA, FHFA, and agencies across government will accelerate efforts to direct available supply to targeted buyers by continuing to target the sale of at least 50 percent of mortgage notes to owner-occupants and mission-driven entities. Encouraging use of CDBG for local acquisition and local sales to owner-occupants and mission-driven entities. HUD also will provide technical assistance and update guidance on the ""Use of CDBG Program Funds in Support of Housing"" to promote acquisition, homeownership assistance, conversion of existing structures into rental housing and ""starter"" homes, housing counseling, and rehabilitation and reconstruction. Promoting modular, panelized, and manufactured housing - and construction R&D. Innovations in homebuilding, including manufactured, modular, panelized, precut, and additive construction, hold promise for increasing housing productivity and thus housing supply. HUD will highlight these and other technologies that can benefit affordable housing construction during the Innovative Housing Showcase on the National Mall in June 2022. HUD is also working to assess hurdles to modular and panelized housing posed by inconsistent state and local inspection requirements and standards, which limit economies of scale and potential cost savings.

05/16/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-096.cfm,HUD Expands Asset-Building Support for HUD-Assisted Families,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) on Monday announced it will publish a rule to implement changes to the Family Self-Sufficiency (FSS) Program. The changes include permanently expanding the definition of an eligible family to include tenants of privately owned multifamily properties subsidized with Project-Based Rental Assistance (PBRA).
""As we mark the 30th anniversary of the Family Self-Sufficiency Program, we are excited to build upon the success of the program to positively impact families for years to come,"" said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""The updates we are announcing today are critical to the Department's work to ensure that the families we serve are connected to the support and opportunities needed to meet their financial goals and build assets.""
In addition to permanently expanding the Program to multifamily owners and allowing them to compete directly for services funding, the rule also expands eligibility for Program enrollment to include any adult member of the household—rather than only the Head of Household—to be more inclusive of households where the Head of Household is unable to work or increase work activity due to issues such as health conditions, disabilities, or family care taking responsibilities. The rule also expands the definition of ""good cause"" for a FSS client contract extension to include participants who are in active pursuit of a long-term goal that will help them get ahead, such as a college degree, as opposed to only reasons outside of the family's control. Additionally, among other positive statutory and regulatory changes, the rule removes administratively burdensome requirements for enrollment and revises graduation requirements.
The Family Self-Sufficiency Program is the largest asset building program for families with low-incomes in the country. Earlier this year, HUD announced $101 million in awards to nearly 700 Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) to support efforts to help residents living in public housing and those participating in the Department's Housing Choice Voucher Program to meet their financial goals. The Department expects to announce additional funding opportunities later this year for renewal programs and new applications, which—for the first time—will be open to owners of HUD-assisted multifamily properties.
This expansion is a key element in the Department's strategy on asset and credit building for HUD-assisted families. In February, Secretary Fudge convened a meeting with current and former public housing and voucher residents to discuss their experiences participating in asset building programs. The residents spoke directly with Secretary Fudge about concerns and barriers faced around financial growth and navigating the economic system. The residents, each of whom have utilized services provided through either FSS or HUD's Resident Opportunities and Self Sufficiency - Service Coordinators Program, shared what has been most helpful in moving forward in their financial goals and what strategies they would like to see implemented to support more residents in their savings, debt reduction, homeownership, and asset building goals.
The goal of the FSS Program continues to be to enable participating low-income families to increase their earned income and meet their financial goals. Local FSS program coordinators create plans with participating families to achieve goals and connect them with services that will assist in making progress toward economic security. Families that meet program requirements and successfully complete the FSS program receive their accrued FSS escrow funds, plus interest. While no formal restrictions exist on the use of the escrowed funds, many families use the funds to help with the purchase of a home, debt reduction, post-secondary education, or to start a new business."

This action today brings together two forms of resilience: long-term care and energy efficiency,"" said Deputy Secretary Adrianne Todman. ""With today's action, we are lowering costs for achieving modern, energy-efficient facilities that will combat climate change while enhancing the safety and well-being of Americans requiring ongoing care.""
As published in the Federal Register (www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection/2022-10539/changes-in-certain-office-of-healthcare-programs-insurance-premiums) today, FHA's new ""Section 232 Green MIP"" will reduce capitalized upfront MIP by 75 basis points, from an existing 100 basis points to a new 25 basis points, for most Section 232 mortgage insurance categories for mortgages on properties that meet Section 232 Green MIP requirements. In addition, FHA will reduce annual MIP rates, which are generally between 45 and 77 basis points, to a new 25 basis points for properties that meet Section 232 Green MIP requirements. On an average FHA Section 232 transaction for an insured loan of $12.5 million, FHA estimates that a borrower will save $93,000 in upfront mortgage insurance premiums on many loan types, and tens of thousands of dollars in annual mortgage insurance premiums depending on the loan type. This significant reduction in mortgage insurance premiums will ultimately lower both upfront and ongoing mortgage debt service costs so that owners committed to maintaining energy efficient facilities can invest capital in their operations.
Section 232 ""Green MIP"" reductions will apply for new Section 232 mortgage insurance applications where the owner of the facility evidences at application submission to FHA that the property will achieve a specified industry-recognized standard for green building certification and will achieve meaningful, measurable energy and water efficiency improvements. Other requirements include:
For properties that have already achieved a specified green building standard certification and that are refinancing with the lower MIP, proceeds must be used to complete further efficiency upgrades and thereby achieve the next-level green certification standards. The property owner must certify that it has achieved, or will pursue, achieve, and maintain a score of 75 or better on the 1-100 ENERGY STAR score, using EPA's Portfolio Manager for the Senior Care Community building type. MIP rates will not be modified on FHA-insured Section 232 loans initially or finally endorsed, in conjunction with Interest Rate Reductions, or in conjunction with Loan Modifications.
• For properties that have already achieved a specified green building standard certification and that are refinancing with the lower MIP, proceeds must be used to complete further efficiency upgrades and thereby achieve the next-level green certification standards.

• MIP rates will not be modified on FHA-insured Section 232 loans initially or finally endorsed, in conjunction with Interest Rate Reductions, or in conjunction with Loan Modifications.
FHA plans to finalize and publish its implementation requirements for lenders to begin using the program with their borrowers in the future, with the intent to begin receiving applications that may be eligible for the Section 232 Green MIP reduction later this year.

05/23/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-100.cfm,"HUD Announces $500,000 Loan Guarantee for Downey, California to Advance Energy Efficiency Upgrades","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced a $500,000 loan guarantee for the City of Downey, California for the Solar Photovoltaic and Battery Energy Storage Systems Project.
The loan guarantee, offered through the Section 108 Loan Guarantee Program, will be used to help finance the installation of energy efficiency upgrades, such as solar photovoltaic (PV) panels, carport canopies, and battery energy storage systems (BESS) at city-owned buildings and facilities. The loan funds will be used for the Solar PV and BESS at the Barbara J. Riley Community and Senior Center.
""Sustainability is a critical piece of our mission at HUD,"" said Jemine A. Bryon, Acting General Deputy Assistant Secretary, Office of Community Planning and Development at HUD. ""This loan guarantee emphasizes our path towards ensuring that all communities have equitable access to clean energy.""
The loan guarantee assistance was awarded through the Section 108 Loan Guarantee Program (Section 108), which provides Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) recipients with the ability to leverage their annual grant allocation to access low-cost, flexible financing for economic development, housing, public facility, and infrastructure projects.
This project will meet the Community Development Block Grant national objective of benefit to people with low and moderate incomes on an area basis by enabling lowering utility coasts for seniors.
The Section 108 Loan Guarantee Program allows local governments to leverage five times their current CDBG award into federally guaranteed loans large enough to pursue physical and economic revitalization projects capable of redeveloping entire neighborhoods. Public investment, such as Section 108 loans, can spur private economic activity, providing the resources or the confidence that private firms and individuals may need to invest in distressed areas.

05/24/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-099.cfm,HUD and Census Bureau Report New Residential Sales in April 2022,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Census Bureau jointly announced the following new residential sales statistics for April 2022:

New Home Sales
Sales of new single-family houses in April 2022 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 591,000, according to estimates released jointly today by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. This is 16.6 percent (±10.4 percent)* below the revised March rate of 709,000 and is 26.9 percent (±13. 7 percent)* below the April 2021 estimate of 809,000.
Sales Price
The median sales price of new houses sold in April 2022 was $450,700. The average sales price was $570,300.
For Sale Inventory and Months' Supply
The seasonally-adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of April was 440,000. This represents a supply of 9.0 months at the current sales rate.

EXPLANATORY NOTES
These statistics are estimated from sample surveys. They are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated average relative standard errors of the preliminary data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. Changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show irregular movement. It takes 4 months to establish a trend for new houses sold. Preliminary new home sales figures are subject to revision due to the survey methodology and definitions used. The survey is primarily based on a sample of houses selected from building permits. Since a ""sale"" is defined as a deposit taken or sales agreement signed, this can occur prior to a permit being issued. An estimate of these prior sales is included in the sales figure. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimate of total sales is revised about 5.8 percent. Changes in sales price data reflect changes in the distribution of houses by region, size, etc., as well as changes in the prices of houses with identical characteristics. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau's website (www.census.gov/construction/nrs/how_the_data_are_collected/index.html).
* The 90 percent confidence interval includes zero. In such cases, there is insufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero.
Notice of Revision: With this release, seasonally adjusted estimates of housing units sold, housing units for sale, and the months' supply of new housing have been revised back to January 2017. All revised estimates are available on our website."

05/31/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-104.cfm,HUD Commemorates the 20th Anniversary of National Homeownership Month,"
WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) mark June as National Homeownership Month following President Biden's proclamation issued on Tuesday (www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/05/31/a-proclamation-on-national-homeownership-month-2022/). This year's Homeownership Month celebrates the 20th year of this opportunity to amplify the benefits of homeownership and the work that remains to achieve fairness and equity in access to affordable homeownership for all Americans who seek it.
In alignment with the Biden-Harris Administration's deep commitment to enabling more households to enjoy the stability and wealth creation that is made possible through homeownership, throughout the month, HUD and FHA will hold a series of events and engagements to amplify the Department's efforts to support potential homeowners, increase housing supply and affordability, and ensure sustainability for existing homeowners.
""Each June, we mark National Homeownership Month, a time for HUD and FHA to renew our commitment to supporting individuals and families in achieving and sustaining homeownership,"" said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""Homeownership is a key source of wealth building and is often the foundation for one's life. Unfortunately, the lack of affordable housing supply has placed homeownership out of reach for many people with low and moderate incomes, first-time homebuyers, and communities that have been historically and systemically locked out of homeownership. The Biden-Harris Administration has put forth the most comprehensive effort to close the housing supply shortfall in history, and we will continue to take action to address the barriers families are facing in today's housing market.""
""The Federal Housing Administration and HUD's Office of Housing are an important part of the nation's housing system,"" said Federal Housing Commissioner Julia Gordon. ""And while we are proud that we serve more than 700,000 first-time homebuyers on average each year, we remain committed to enhancing and improving our programs to promote expanded access and equity in homeownership, particularly for underserved communities.""
HUD's Office of Housing and Federal Housing Administration play a vital role for the nation's homebuyers, homeowners, renters, and communities through their nationally administered programs. Today, under the leadership of Secretary Fudge and Commissioner Gordon, HUD continues to prioritize FHA's mission through:
Taking Action to Increase Housing Supply and Access to Affordable Housing. Under the leadership of President Biden and Secretary Fudge, HUD has taken action to ease the burden of housing costs over time by boosting the supply of quality housing in every community. In May, the Biden-Harris Administration announced an Action Plan to Ease the Burden of Housing Costs (www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/16/president-biden-announces-new-actions-to-ease-the-burden-of-housing-costs/). The Plan is a set of legislative and administrative steps aimed at closing the housing supply gap within the next five years. HUD is also making more single-family homes available to individuals, families, and non-profit organizations by prioritizing homeownership and sale to non-profits when disposing of HUD-held assets.
Launched a Whole-of-Government Plan for Wide-Ranging Reforms to Advance Equity in Home Appraisals. In March, HUD delivered the Interagency Task Force on Property Appraisal and Valuation Equity (PAVE) Action Plan to President Biden. The PAVE Action Plan is aimed squarely at dismantling racial bias in the home lending and appraisal process and promoting generational wealth creation through homeownership. This Action Plan, when enacted, represents the most wide-ranging set of reforms ever put forward to advance equity in the home appraisal process. The PAVE Task Force, co-chaired by Secretary Fudge and White House Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice, is the first-of-its-kind interagency initiative to address racial bias in home appraisals and includes senior leaders from thirteen Cabinet and independent agencies and components of the Executive Office of the President.
Serving More First-time Homebuyers and Communities of Color. In November, FHA announced a historically strong Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund Report showing that, in addition to its emphasis on delivering relief options to homeowners financially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, FHA continued to deliver on its mission of enabling homeownership for first-time homebuyers, people with low and moderate incomes, and households of color. The percentage of first-time homebuyers using FHA insurance reached a new high, the share of FHA-insured mortgages made to minority borrowers reached almost 42 percent of all FHA forward mortgage insurance endorsements. According to 2020 HMDA data, FHA served double the percentage of Black and Hispanic borrowers compared to the rest of the mortgage market.
Preventing Foreclosures for Borrowers Affected by the COVID-19 Pandemic. HUD and FHA continue to assist borrowers who missed mortgages payments because of COVID-19. For some time now, FHA has offered a number of mortgage options. In April, FHA added a new 40-year mortgage modification option for mortgage servicers to use in conjunction with its partial claim option to assist additional borrowers who are behind on their mortgage payments.
As a result, FHA's seriously delinquent rate has significantly decreased from a high of 11.90%, or 942,000 mortgages, at the end of November 2020 to 5.23%, or 380,000 mortgages, as of April 2022. This improvement is due in large part to the effectiveness of FHA options. Since January 2021 alone, more than one million borrowers have exited forbearance. From January 2021 through April 2022, FHA servicers have completed almost 1.3 million COVID-19 home retention actions through loss mitigation options.
Removing Barriers to Homeownership for Those with Student Loan Debt. Last summer, FHA updated its policy on student loan monthly payment calculations to remove barriers and provide more access to affordable single-family FHA-insured mortgage financing for creditworthy individuals with student loan debt, which has disproportionate impact on communities of color. The new policy bases the monthly payment on the actual student loan payment a borrower pays, rather than a percentage of the balance, more closely aligning FHA policies with industry standards.
Affirmed the Use of Special Purpose Credit Programs. More than 50 years after the passage of the Fair Housing Act, access to security and wealth provided by homeownership remains persistently unequal. Part of the solution to that problem has to be for lenders and others to find creative ways to extend credit to communities that desperately need it to start building equity. In December, HUD made clear that the use of certain Special Purpose Credit Programs (SPCPs) to help address inequities in barriers to credit and homeownership is lawful under the Fair Housing Act. A Special Purpose Credit Program is a tool that allows lenders to meet the specific needs of historically disadvantaged groups. On January 26, Secretary Fudge convened a virtual meeting with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Federal Reserve, Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), and National Credit Union Association to discuss the roles of HUD and partner agencies in expanding homeownership opportunities for those who have been and continue to be systemically excluded from the housing and credit markets. The group discussed future steps to encourage use of SPCPs as a means of addressing persistent disparities in access to homeownership.
Setting the Stage for Increased Fair Housing and Lending Enforcement and Access. Last summer, HUD entered into a first-of-its-kind memorandum of understanding(www.fhfa.gov/Media/PublicAffairs/PublicAffairsDocuments/FHFA-HUD-MOU_8122021.pdf) (MOU) with FHFA, marking a historic collaboration on fair housing and fair lending enforcement and oversight engagement with the FHFA-regulated entities including Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Banks. This comprehensive effort will ensure deeper collaboration on fair housing investigations and enable data sharing to help strengthen and affirmatively further fair housing for the mortgage industry."
06/01/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-105.cfm,"Secretary Fudge Launches ""Our Way Home"" Initiative to Increase Affordable Housing Supply in Local Communities","WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia L. Fudge on Wednesday launched the Our Way Home initiative, a new effort to boost the nation's affordable housing supply. Our Way Home builds on the Biden-Harris Administration's actions to address communities' housing supply needs in an equitable, inclusive, and sustainable fashion.
Our Way Home is a national initiative that uplifts the unique housing supply successes in local communities and connects cities, counties, Tribal communities, states, and U.S. Territories to the tools and resources needed to help preserve and produce affordable housing in their area.
""Easing the burden of housing costs for families is a top economic priority for this Administration,"" said Secretary Fudge. ""For too long and in too many communities, housing supply has not kept up with the growing demand. It's going to take government working at all levels to help close the housing supply gap. I am excited to launch Our Way Home, an initiative that will not only build on the momentum that's already begun at the federal level, but will also put into focus the unique challenges and successes in communities when it comes to making sure we all find our way home.""
On Wednesday morning, Secretary Fudge will be joined by Mayor Muriel Bowser to formally launch Our Way Home during an event at the Spring Flats affordable housing complex in Washington, DC. On Wednesday afternoon, Deputy Secretary Adrianne Todman will travel to Wilmington, Delaware for a roundtable with U.S. Senators Chris Coons and Tom Carper.
As part of the Day of Action, HUD Regional Administrators will hold events throughout the country on Wednesday and Thursday to recognize the launch and directly engage with local and state leadership:
HUD Region 1: Regional Administrator Juana Matias will hold a roundtable at Stuart Apartments, a newly constructed affordable housing development in Colchester, Vermont. She will be joined by Vermont Governor Phil Scott and others.
HUD Region 2: Regional Administrator Alicka Ampry-Samuel will host a tour and roundtable at Holland Gardens in Jersey City, New Jersey. She will be joined by U.S. Representative Donald Payne, Jr., and others.

Our Way Home builds on HUD's commitment to state, tribal, and local leaders to help them utilize federal resources and funding to meet their affordable housing supply needs, and to build new and preserve existing units of affordable housing - rental and homeownership - into their pipelines.
Last month, the Biden-Harris Administration announced its Housing Supply Action Plan (www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/16/president-biden-announces-new-actions-to-ease-the-burden-of-housing-costs/), which included over a dozen legislative and administrative steps aim to close the housing supply gap within the next five years.
""The shortage of affordable housing has been growing for decades - but this is a solvable crisis,"" said Secretary Fudge. ""Across the country, we are seeing many communities ending exclusionary zoning, building affordable housing in communities that previously did not allow it. We are seeing communities use innovative building models and materials, and design homes that are sustainable and resilient. And we're seeing communities tackle homelessness by building permanent affordable housing with services. These are the types of community wins that we want to elevate with Our Way Home and encourage others to follow.""
Through the American Rescue Plan, communities now have historic levels of housing resources, including $5 billion in HOME grants and significant investments to preserve and protect housing on tribal lands, to help more Americans obtain stable housing.
As part of the Our Way Home initiative, HUD will continue to elevate community wins and learn from communities that are building and preserving affordable homes. The Department will be engaging communities in discussions on housing supply policies and resources in the coming months.

06/02/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-106.cfm,HUD Announces Fair Lending Agreement with Mortgage Company,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced the entry of a Conciliation Agreement (Agreement) between the National Community Reinvestment Coalition (NCRC) and Movement Mortgage LLC, resolving allegations that it engaged in discriminatory lending practices based on race and national origin, in violation of the Fair Housing Act. Read the Agreement.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits mortgage lenders and others involved in housing-related lending practices from discriminating because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex (including gender identity and sexual orientation), disability, and familial status.
""This agreement reflects HUD's commitment to ensuring that everyone has equal access to credit regardless of their race or national origin,"" said Demetria L. McCain, HUD's Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""It is imperative that lenders comply with fair housing laws. HUD will continue working to ensure that all applicants are treated equally.""
This Agreement arises from a complaint filed with HUD by NCRC alleging that it had conducted testing in the Seattle-Tacoma area, which revealed different treatment of Black and Hispanic testers and White testers seeking housing loans. Movement Mortgage, LLC denies having provided less favorable treatment to the testers based on race or national origin.
Under the Agreement terms, Movement Mortgage LLC will pay $65,000 to NCRC and contribute an additional $10,000 to a Seattle-area non-profit organization specializing in providing financial literacy and housing education and counseling for persons in majority-minority census tracts in the Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue metropolitan area. Movement Mortgage, LLC will also conduct a ""Grab the Key"" event in the Seattle metro area designed to improve homeownership rates of Black homebuyers. Employees of Movement Mortgage LLC will also complete additional fair lending training. The agreement should not be construed as an admission of fault by the mortgage company or as evidence of a finding that Movement Mortgage LLC violated the Fair Housing Act.
Individuals who believe they have experienced discrimination in housing may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 877-8339 (Federal Relay Service)."

HUD-certified housing counselors can help consumers understand their options for buying their first home, obtaining rental assistance, considering a reverse mortgage, and avoiding eviction or foreclosure,"" said Assistant Secretary for Housing and Federal Housing Commissioner Julia Gordon.
The online locator is available in English and Spanish and includes improved navigation, more counseling type search choices, smart-phone capability, and integration with common map and directional technology. The locator also provides information for contacting national housing counseling intermediary organizations which can expand a consumer's options, particularly where there is no locally available agency. The new telephonic locator responds to voice prompts and allows users to request information and assistance from a customer service representative from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., ET. Users can also request assistance from translators who are available to assist in more than 200 languages.
""With the increasing role of housing counselors in assisting with urgent housing issues like disaster relief and recovery and housing instability, the importance of being able to quickly connect consumers to HUD-approved housing counseling agencies is vitally important,"" said Office of Housing Counseling Deputy Assistant Secretary David Berenbaum. ""It is thanks to a tremendous partnership between our Office of Housing Counseling and the Office of Single Family Housing that we were able to replace outdated, 25-year-old technology with a robust, comprehensive, and easy-to-use set of tools for consumers.""

06/07/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-108.cfm,HUD Awards Funding to Fight Housing Discrimination,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today awarded $125,000 to support fair housing organizations working to help end housing discrimination. These funds are provided through the Department's Fair Housing Initiatives Program (FHIP) both to help people who believe they have been victims of housing discrimination and to educate housing providers about fair housing laws.
The American Rescue Plan (ARP) Act of 2021 recognizes that fair housing enforcement and education and outreach services are an essential component of protecting persons from housing discrimination in the U.S. Fair Housing Initiatives Program funding will be used to provide emergency relief to fair housing organizations to address fair housing inquiries, complaints, investigations, education and outreach activities, and the costs of delivering or adapting services, during or relating to the coronavirus pandemic.
Through this funding opportunity, HUD awarded a grant to The Fair Housing Council of Suburban Philadelphia, Inc. The Fair Housing Council of Suburban Philadelphia will receive $125,000 to expand its capacity to respond to increased volume of complaint inquires and allegations of discrimination during the coronavirus pandemic and reduce discrimination against protected classes in Greater Philadelphia and Lehigh Valley, PA.
The grant recipient has proposed to screen 200 complaint inquiries; provide information, advice, or referrals to 100 consumers with landlord tenant complaints; process 100 allegations of housing discrimination; assist 15 people with disabilities requesting reasonable accommodation or modifications; and refer 20 complaints to HUD, the U.S. Department of Justice, Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission (PHRC) or private attorneys.

06/07/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-109.cfm,HUD Enters into Agreement with Maryland Condominium Company and Management Agent to Resolve Claims of Disability Discrimination,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has entered into a Consent Order with a Baltimore, Maryland condominium company, Scarlett Place Residential Condominium, Inc., and its management agent, Brodie Management, Inc., to resolve a Charge of Discrimination alleging disability discrimination. Read the Consent Order here.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing discrimination because of race, sex, color, national origin, religion, familial status, and disability. It requires housing providers to make reasonable accommodations when necessary for persons with disabilities.
""It is unconscionable that families caring for children with disabilities could also face housing discrimination,"" said Demetria L. McCain, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""This consent order demonstrates HUD's commitment to protecting the fair housing rights of families and persons with disabilities.""
HUD's Charge of Discrimination alleged that Scarlett Place Residential Condominium and Brodie Management violated the Fair Housing Act because of disability when they refused to waive their rule limiting occupants to two persons per bedroom to allow a family of eight - one of which was a young child having bone marrow transplant treatment at nearby Johns Hopkins Hospital - to temporarily rent a three-bedroom condominium. The family needed to live together to facilitate the young child's medical treatment and care, which included the screening of all family members for a viable bone marrow donor. The condominium's board of directors levied a monthly fine against the unit's owner because of the family's occupancy of the condominium.
The Consent Order, entered into by HUD's Chief Administrative Law Judge, requires Scarlett Place Residential Condominium and Brodie Management to pay the family and the condominium owner a total of $35,743.50 in damages, and to take other actions to ensure nondiscrimination because of disability. The Consent Order does not constitute an admission of liability by either Scarlett Place Residential Condominium or Brodie Management.
""Housing providers must allow families to provide care for their children with disabilities when a simple waiver of condominium rules can be made,"" said Damon Smith, HUD's General Counsel. ""HUD will vigorously enforce the Fair Housing Act's protections for persons with disabilities.""
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 877-8339 (Relay). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to hud.gov/fairhousing."

06/17/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-110.cfm,Secretary Fudge Announces $520 Million to Protect Low-Income Households from Lead and Other Home Health and Safety Hazards,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Marcia L. Fudge today announced that the Department is making available $520 million to state and local government agencies to protect children and families from lead-based paint and other home health hazards. This is the largest lead and healthy homes funding ever made available by HUD to jurisdictions to improve the health and safety of housing in communities around the country.
Secretary Fudge announced the funding at Community Empowerment Association in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where she was joined by Vice President Kamala Harris, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Michael Regan, impacted community members, and elected officials. The administration officials visited the city to discuss the Biden-Harris Administration's historic investments to remove and replace lead pipes and eliminate lead paint hazards.
""Improving housing quality, addressing the inequities that got us here, and advancing environmental justice are of critical importance to us,"" said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""Our Lead Based Paint Hazard Reduction grant program is a crucial part of protecting our children and building the infrastructure for making homes healthy and safe, even after the grants have ended.""
This grant opportunity, which coincides with National Healthy Homes Month, is under HUD's Lead Based Paint Hazard Reduction grant program. The program identifies and cleans up dangerous lead hazards and additional health and safety hazards in low-income families' privately-owned homes. This grant funding includes $30 million of HUD's Healthy Homes Supplements to help communities with other health and safety hazards in homes where lead-based paint hazards are being treated.
These investments will protect families and children by targeting significant lead and health hazards in over 40,000 low-income homes for which other resources are not available. These grants will prevent the developmental and other effects of lead on children, reduce injuries by children and adults, lower health care costs, increase school and work attendance and performance; and increase income and opportunity of the families whose homes state and local grantees will treat.
These grants will improve the healthfulness of the treated homes, which is part of HUD's efforts to improve the health of people across this country. Improving these homes not only improves the lives of residents but improves the neighborhoods and communities they call home.
The purpose of the grant program announced today is to maximize the number of children under the age of six protected from lead poisoning by assisting states, cities, counties/parishes, Native American Tribes, or other units of local government in undertaking comprehensive programs to identify and control lead-based paint hazards in eligible privately-owned rental or owner-occupied housing populations.
Through efforts by the federal, state, tribal, and local governments, partnering with nonprofits and supportive firms in the housing and environmental sectors, the average blood lead level in children under age six - who are most affected by lead exposure - has decreased by half in the past decade. Even so, almost half of the housing built when lead paint could be used in homes - that is, before 1978 - have hazardous conditions of lead. Much needs to be done to reduce these hazards.
These grants being made available today will contribute to about 75 communities' efforts to address the problem by mitigating unhealthy housing, preserving affordable housing, and improving the health and wellness of families and children living in these communities.
Lead is a highly toxic metal that may cause a range of health problems, especially in young children. When lead is absorbed into the body, it can cause damage to the brain and other vital organs, like the kidneys, nerves, and blood. Lead may also cause behavioral problems, learning disabilities, seizures, and in extreme cases, death. Some symptoms of lead poisoning may include headaches, stomachaches, nausea, tiredness, and irritability. Children who are lead poisoned may show no symptoms.

06/21/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-111.cfm,HUD Closes $16 Million Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) Conversion Transaction with the Columbus Metropolitan Housing Authority (CMHA) to Build and Preserve 150 Homes at Post Oak Station,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Office of Multifamily Housing on Tuesday announced that it has closed a Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) transaction with the Columbus Metropolitan Housing Authority (CMHA) in Columbus, OH. The project, Post Oak Station, located on the west side of the city, will include 142 rehabilitated affordable rental homes as well as eight newly constructed affordable rental homes and a new daycare center.
In May, Secretary Marcia L. Fudge traveled to Columbus, Ohio to announce the Biden-Harris Administration's actions (www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/16/president-biden-announces-new-actions-to-ease-the-burden-of-housing-costs/) to ease the burden of housing costs and increase the affordable housing supply in Columbus and across the country. Secretary Fudge was joined by U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown, U.S. Representative Joyce Beatty, and Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther. The transaction with the Columbus Housing Authority is a new step the federal government is taking to expand affordable housing in the area.
The current development on this site, Post Oak Station II, consists of 26 two-story apartment buildings and one single-story club house constructed in 1971. RAD will allow for the CMHA to raise $16 million for its construction budget ($106,000 per unit), which will be fully financed through:
$7.3 million FHA-insured mortgage under the 221(d)(4) program Public Housing Capital Funds 4% Low Income Housing Tax Credits
• $7.3 million FHA-insured mortgage under the 221(d)(4) program
• Public Housing Capital Funds
• 4% Low Income Housing Tax Credits
As part of this transaction, CMHA will renovate the community building to give residents an improved gathering space. The rehabilitation of the existing 142 units will include new furnaces, air conditioning units, appliances, and water heaters and updates of the bathrooms, kitchens, and electrical systems. The eight new affordable rental homes will be constructed in two new buildings that will be added to the site. These updates as well as a brand-new daycare center will help to improve the quality of life for families.
About RAD
RAD was designed to help address the multi-billion-dollar nationwide backlog of deferred maintenance in the public housing portfolio and to stem the loss of affordable housing that could no longer be kept to decent standards. From the program's inception through June 1, 2022, the Rental Assistance Demonstration has facilitated more than $14.7 billion in capital investment to improve or replace nearly 180,000 deeply rent-assisted homes, most of which house extremely low-income families, seniors, and persons with disabilities.
Under RAD, projects funded under the public housing program convert their public housing assistance to project-based Section 8 rental assistance. Under Section 8, residents continue to pay 30% of their income towards rent and the housing must continue to serve those with very low and extremely low incomes, as was the case when the property was assisted through the public housing program. Residents must be notified and consulted prior to conversion, are given a right to return to assisted housing post-construction so that the same tenants can enjoy these newly preserved and improved apartments and maintain the same fundamental rights they had as public housing residents.
RAD Resources
More programmatic information is available at the RAD website. Data on RAD is available at the RAD Resource Desk (www.radresource.net/pha_data2020.cfm).

06/21/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-112.cfm,HUD Closes Rental Assistance Demonstration Conversion Transaction with Virgin Islands Housing Authority to Rehabilitate Affordable Rental Homes in St. Croix,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Office of Multifamily Housing on Tuesday announced that it has closed a Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) transaction with the Virgin Islands Housing Authority in St. Croix, Virgin Islands, to rehabilitate 248 affordable homes at the Walter I.M. Hodge Pavilion community. This property consists of 20 residential buildings and one community building comprised of 248 homes. These homes were significantly damaged during Hurricanes Irma and Maria in September 2017 from flying debris and flooding, causing 58% of them to be vacant. Through RAD, the property will continue to bring much needed affordable housing to the St. Croix area where the existing waitlist is more than 764 families. As part of the conversion, the property will undergo rehabilitation and transition from public housing to Section 8 project-based rental assistance.
In May, Secretary Marcia L. Fudge announced the Biden-Harris Administration's actions (www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/16/president-biden-announces-new-actions-to-ease-the-burden-of-housing-costs/) to ease the burden of housing costs and increase the affordable housing supply. The transaction with the Virgin Islands Housing Authority is a new step the federal government is taking to expand affordable housing in this region.
The RAD transaction includes a construction budget of $73.3 million ($295,000 per unit) fully financed through:
Low Income Housing Tax Credit Equity Merchant Bank of Indiana Commercial Construction Financing Community Development Block Grant - Disaster Recovery Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) through the Public Assistance Program
• Low Income Housing Tax Credit Equity
• Merchant Bank of Indiana Commercial Construction Financing
• Community Development Block Grant - Disaster Recovery
• Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) through the Public Assistance Program
Construction will include significant hazard mitigation measures to break the cycle of disaster damage. Buildings will be hardened against future storms, and landscaping and site plan improvements will naturally protect against water intrusion and damage. Resilience improvements include roof and shear wall reinforcement to withstand hurricane winds, hurricane-resistant doors and windows, and aluminum louver systems. Partially underground electrical lines will reduce the chances of power outage and back-up generators will provide critical energy should one occur. An existing cistern system will be upgraded to capture and treat rainwater, and solar panels will be installed, allowing the buildings to efficiently harness and preserve natural resources. The site will also be transformed through beautification measures and improved community spaces.
The Virgin Islands Housing Authority is pursuing RAD conversions to rehabilitate and preserve homes across several of its developments. The one participating in this transaction, Walter I.M. Hodge Pavilion, is in the Smithfield community of Frederiksted. Buildings will be upgraded by replacing most major systems, improving site amenities, and incorporating materials and design principles for greening and climate resilience. Units will feature new apartment bathroom and kitchen interiors, asbestos and lead abatement, and additional measures to preserve resources, enhance hazard resilience, and reduce utility costs.
The project will be owned by Walter I.M. Hodge RAD LLC, and MDG Development Owners LLC with the ground leased from Virgin Islands Housing Authority.
About RAD
RAD was designed to help address the multi-billion-dollar nationwide backlog of deferred maintenance in the public housing portfolio and to stem the loss of affordable housing that could no longer be kept to decent standards. From the program's inception through June 1, 2022, the Rental Assistance Demonstration has facilitated more than $14.7 billion in capital investment to improve or replace nearly 180,000 deeply rent-assisted homes, most of which house extremely low-income families, seniors, and persons with disabilities.
Under RAD, projects funded under the public housing program convert their public housing assistance to project-based Section 8 rental assistance. Under Section 8, residents continue to pay 30% of their income towards rent and the housing must continue to serve those with very low and extremely low incomes, as was the case when the property was assisted through the public housing program. Residents must be notified and consulted prior to conversion, are given a right to return to assisted housing post-construction so that the same tenants can enjoy these newly preserved and improved apartments and maintain the same fundamental rights they had as public housing residents.

06/22/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-113.cfm,"Biden Administration Announces First-Ever Funding Opportunity for Coordinated Approaches to Address Unsheltered Homelessness, Including Resources for Rural Communities","WASHINGTON - The Biden Administration through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today released a first-of-its-kind package of resources to address unsheltered homelessness and homeless encampments, including funds set aside specifically to address homelessness in rural communities.
The $365 million package includes grant funds along with additional vouchers that will enhance communities' capacity to humanely and effectively address unsheltered homelessness by connecting vulnerable individuals and families to housing, health care, and supportive services. This Initiative for Unsheltered and Rural Homelessness being made available by HUD strongly promotes partnerships with health care organizations, public housing authorities and mainstream housing providers, and people with lived experience and expertise of homelessness.
""We have a responsibility to ensure that people sleeping in their vehicles, in tents, or on the streets, including in rural areas, have access to decent, stable housing and services, like health care and treatment, to live with dignity and safety,"" said Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""Solving unsheltered homelessness means delivering help to the people who need it the most, but who have the hardest time reaching it. It means putting Housing First and health care and other supportive services right after. With this funding, communities will have the resources to scale up coordinated efforts to humanely and effectively move people from encampments into homes by linking homeless outreach with health care, treatment, and housing.""
""Access to a safe place to call home is essential to health and well-being,"" said Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra. ""The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to working across the federal government to end homelessness by ensuring access to health care, support services, and permanent housing for all Americans. I am pleased to support Secretary Fudge in bringing housing and health care within greater reach for those who need it most, including in rural communities.""
""Getting unsheltered Veterans and homeless rural Vets into houses is a top priority in the Department of Veterans Affairs' strategy to end Veteran homelessness,"" said Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Denis McDonough. ""These new resources from HUD add timely new capacity to this fight. No Veteran should ever be homeless in this country, which they swore an oath to defend.""
""President Biden is following through on his promise to unite our country by delivering funding for health care and services that support individuals who are unhoused,"" said Dr. Rahul Gupta, Director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP). ""As a physician I have seen firsthand how important it is to address the social and economic conditions of a person's life in order for them to realize the health and well-being every American deserves. Today's announcement is a key step in our work to do just that.""
Specifically, the package includes:
$322 million in Continuum of Care Program grants through a Special Notice of Funding Opportunity to fund homeless outreach, permanent housing, supportive services, and other costs as part of a comprehensive community approach to solve unsheltered homelessness, including a set-aside of $54.5 million specifically for rural communities. These grants will fund projects for three-years, after which they will be eligible for renewal through the annual Continuum of Care program competition. $43 million to fund approximately 4,000 new incremental vouchers will be allocated via a separate notice to public housing authorities with a priority to those that are partners in comprehensive community approaches to solve homelessness. These vouchers can serve households experiencing or at-risk of homelessness; those fleeing or attempting to flee domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking; and veterans and families that include a veteran family member that meets one of the proceeding criteria. Congress has provided HUD with waiver authorities to facilitate lease-up for vulnerable households.

06/22/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-114.cfm,HUD Makes Over $30 Million Available to State and Local Fair Housing Enforcement Partners,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) on Wednesday announced it has allocated $30.1 million in noncompetitive funding for HUD's state and local fair housing enforcement agencies across the country under its Fair Housing Assistance Program (FHAP). The FHAP is an intergovernmental partnership between the federal government and state and local agencies to provide protection to the public against discrimination in housing. The funding to state and local enforcement agencies supports fair housing complaint investigations and education and outreach activities to inform the public, housing providers, and local governments about their rights and responsibilities under both the Fair Housing Act and state and local fair housing laws.
This funding supports the efforts of 77 state, county, and city agencies in administering fair housing laws that provide rights, remedies, and procedures that are substantially equivalent to those provided by the federal Fair Housing Act. All of HUD's FHAP partners can be found here.
""Our state and local Fair Housing Assistance Program partners play a critical role,"" said Demetria McCain, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Housing discrimination based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex (including sexual orientation and gender identity), disability, and familial status has no place in our society, and these agencies are critical to helping us fight against it.""
Through this funding cycle, HUD is providing an approximate 6.5% increase in both Case Processing Fund reimbursement rates and Administrative Cost Funds, which are the two main sources of FHAP funding provided annually to the Department's agency partners.
In addition, HUD is making a total of $2 million in Partnership funds available to support eligible FHAP agencies in partnering with community organizations on targeted testing, and education and outreach activities. HUD has also expanded the scope and use of Special Enforcement Effort funds to make $1.1 million available to support the effort of agencies to create effective hybrid work environments to conduct fair housing enforcement work, a necessity during the coronavirus pandemic.
To learn more about how a state or local jurisdiction can become a Fair Housing Assistance Program, visit the Department's FHAP website. People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 877-8339 (Relay). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to hud.gov/fairhousing."
06/22/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-115.cfm,HUD Invests Over $22 Million for Native Hawaiian Housing,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development on Wednesday announced $22.3 million in Native Hawaiian Housing Block Grant (NHHBG) funding to support the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands (DHHL). This funding will support the housing needs of low-income Native Hawaiian families.
""The State of Hawaii has the highest median home prices in the nation, and too often our Native Hawaiian communities are among the most negatively affected by the prohibitively high cost of housing,"" said Jason Pu, Regional Administrator for HUD Region 9, which includes Hawaii. ""The NHHBG program enables HUD to get federal funds directly to Native Hawaiian communities for more affordable housing now and long-term investments that will benefit generations to come. ""The funding may be used for the construction, rehabilitation, and acquisition of housing; infrastructure; and various support services. In addition, the funding may be used to provide rental assistance to Native Hawaiians living on or off the Hawaiian home lands.
Over the past 20 years, over $150 million in NHHBG funds have been used by DHHL to construct, rehabilitate, and acquire over 700 affordable homes; improve over 600 lots with infrastructure development to support construction of new housing; rehabilitate community centers to provide housing services to residents; and provide over 3,000 families with housing-related services, including financial literacy training, home repair training, and rental assistance."
06/23/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-116.cfm,HUD Awards $4 Million to Public Housing Agencies to Protect Families from Potential Exposures to Radon,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes today awarded $4 million to nine public housing agencies (PHAs) to conduct radon testing and, as needed, radon mitigation in approximately 1,000 housing units. Where applicable, the funding will also support the development of PHAs' plans for future testing and mitigation. See how agencies will use funding.
""This radon grant program broadens HUD's environmental interventions in the home,"" said Matthew Ammon, Director of the Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes. ""The program also underscores the importance of our partnership with PHAs to reduce radon concentrations indoors, thereby reducing the risks of radon induced lung cancer.""
""We are pleased to partner on this radon demonstration grant program to provide resources to PHAs for radon testing and mitigation,"" said Robert Mulderig, Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Office of Public Housing Investments. ""This program will promote awareness among PHAs and other multifamily rental property managers on how to effectively measure and mitigate radon.""
The funding, providing through HUD's new Radon Testing and Mitigation Demonstration Program Notice of Funding Opportunity for public housing agencies, will provide HUD with important information on methods and costs for radon testing and mitigation in public housing around the country.
HUD participates in an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-led interagency effort to increase federal agencies' actions to address radon in their programs with a goal to save lives by increasing radon testing, mitigation, and radon resistant new construction in the U.S. HUD's creation and administration of the Radon Testing and Mitigation Demonstration Grant Program represents a continuation of this effort.
EPA estimates that about 1 in 15 homes (7 percent) in the U.S. have elevated radon levels. EPA also estimates that about 21,000 people die in the U.S. annually due to lung cancer from radon exposure.
Radon is an odorless, colorless, radioactive gas that is a decay product of elements in soil and rock and is present in every part of the country. Low levels of radon are found in the outside air. Radon gas can move through the soil and enter buildings through small openings in the foundation or basement and become concentrated in the indoor air environment. When radon is inhaled, it can damage DNA in lung tissue and increase the risk of developing lung cancer. Radon is the number one cause of lung cancer among non-smokers, according to EPA estimates.
The following is a breakdown of the funding announced today:"

06/28/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-118.cfm,HUD and Census Bureau Report New Residential Sales in May 2022,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Census Bureau jointly announced the following new residential sales statistics for May 2022:

New Home Sales
Sales of new single-family houses in May 2022 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 696,000, according to estimates released jointly by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. This is 10.7 percent (±18.9 percent)* above the revised April rate of 629,000, but is 5.9 percent (±22.0 percent)* below the May 2021 estimate of 740,000.
Sales Price
The median sales price of new houses sold in May 2022 was $449,000. The average sales price was $511,400.
For Sale Inventory and Months' Supply
The seasonally-adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of May was 440,000. This represents a supply of 7.7 months at the current sales rate.

EXPLANATORY NOTES
These statistics are estimated from sample surveys. They are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated average relative standard errors of the preliminary data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. Changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show irregular movement. It takes 4 months to establish a trend for new houses sold. Preliminary new home sales figures are subject to revision due to the survey methodology and definitions used. The survey is primarily based on a sample of houses selected from building permits. Since a ""sale"" is defined as a deposit taken or sales agreement signed, this can occur prior to a permit being issued. An estimate of these prior sales is included in the sales figure. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimate of total sales is revised about 5.8 percent. Changes in sales price data reflect changes in the distribution of houses by region, size, etc., as well as changes in the prices of houses with identical characteristics. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau's website (www.census.gov/construction/nrs/how_the_data_are_collected/index.html).
* The 90 percent confidence interval includes zero. In such cases, there is insufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero."

Haley Sofge, built in 1973, is a 13-story building in need of substantial rehabilitation. This transaction will preserve 240 low-income senior housing homes, maintaining them as long term, stable, and affordable housing for senior residents in Miami.
The RAD transaction includes a $35.4 million construction budget ($145,000 per unit) fully financed through:
A Commercial First Mortgage Loan 4% Low-Income Housing Tax Credits
• A Commercial First Mortgage Loan
• 4% Low-Income Housing Tax Credits
The renovations will include changes to allow for additional one-bedroom homes, and additional on-site amenities including a common area with a kitchen, elevators, laundry facilities, and parking. Homes will feature high-end tile, Energy Star appliances, as well as air conditioning. Through RAD, the immediate and future needs of the project are addressed through the recapitalization, setting the project up for both financial and physical stability over the long-term.
This project is part of a large-scale redevelopment effort of Miami's Little Havana neighborhood, as outlined in Miami-Dade County Public Housing & Community Development's River Parc Master Plan. This master plan, when fully implemented, will have up to 2,400 affordable, workforce, and market rate units with several other RAD conversions in this 22-acre area. This is the fourth RAD transaction to close at this site, following the newly constructed Gallery at River Parc, a 150-home family project adjacent to Haley Sofge, Paseo Del Rio, a 182-home family project on the same site as Haley Sofge, and Robert King High, a substantially rehabilitated, 315-home senior project.

07/01/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-121.cfm,"To Mark Disability Pride Month and the 32nd Anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, HUD Reaffirms Its Commitment to Community Living for Individuals with Disabilities","July marks the 2022 celebration of Disability Pride Month and the 32nd anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, a comprehensive civil rights law for persons with disabilities. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is using this opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to support the rights of individuals with disabilities to integration and community living as upheld in the landmark case, Olmstead v. L.C. HUD recognizes that quality, accessible, and affordable housing is vital to fulfilling the civil rights of individuals with disabilities, and that furthering the goals of Olmstead is a core part of our mission.
Supporting community living through affordable, integrated, and accessible housing is a top priority at HUD and pursued every day as a cross-departmental effort. While this work is ongoing, this fact sheet reflects some of the recent ways HUD is ensuring that individuals with disabilities can access our housing programs to transition from or avoid institutional settings, avoid housing discrimination and exclusion on the basis of their disability, and maximize their choice and independence.
Assisting Individuals with Disabilities to Transition from Institutional Settings to the Community
Since April 2021, HUD, alongside the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), has provided technical assistance to help the public housing agencies (PHAs) that administer Mainstream Vouchers for non-elderly persons with disabilities to strengthen their partnerships with state agencies that assist persons with disabilities to transition from institutional settings to the community. In March 2022, HUD launched two Communities of Practice (COP) convening PHAs that administer Mainstream Vouchers in Connecticut and Minnesota. The COP is strengthening coordination between PHAs and agencies that assist individuals with disabilities and improving successful lease-ups of community-based housing among people transitioning to the community from institutional settings.
In December 2021, HUD and HHS launched the joint Housing and Services Resource Center (https://acl.gov/HousingAndServices) (HSRC) , a one-stop shop for technical assistance, resources, and guidance on how to coordinate HUD and HHS programs to provide community-based housing and supportive services to support community living among individuals with disabilities and older adults, including people experiencing homelessness. More than 30,000 individuals have visited the Housing and Services Resource Center website and HUD and HHS have provided technical assistance to states, communities, and community-based organizations to assist them with coordinating HUD and HHS programs to support community living for individuals with disabilities. More than 9,300 people have engaged in one or more of the HSRC webinars, conference sessions, HSRC and House America office hours, Public Housing Authority Communities of Practice, and the Money Follows the Person Learning collaboratives. The HSRC featured promising state or community partnerships across the country from numerous states including CA, MA, MD, OH, IA, TN, TX, and WA.
In June 2022, HUD announced the availability of $40 million in carryover funding for additional Mainstream Vouchers to support community living for persons with disabilities. In addition, HUD announced that it is making available $500 per Mainstream Voucher awarded in extraordinary administrative fees that will enable PHAs to help individuals with disabilities overcome barriers to finding and leasing rental housing. These additional fees can be used to provide housing search and lease-up assistance, as well as landlord incentives, security deposits, and vacancy payments.
Individuals with disabilities face significant barriers obtaining and using housing assistance and can benefit from assistance with the application process, searching for accessible and affordable housing, requesting reasonable accommodations, and moving into the unit. HUD is currently conducting a study that examines successful programs and approaches that help individuals with disabilities overcome these challenges and successfully use housing assistance. The final report, entitled ‘Housing Search Assistance for People with Disabilities,' will be published in 2023.
Addressing Housing Discrimination among Individuals with Disabilities
HUD has completed high-profile Section 504 investigations and compliance reviews that have resulted in significant monetary and other relief to victims. Other relief has included significant changes to policies and practices, including increases in physical or programmatic accessibility provided by recipients of federal financial assistance. HUD has pursued relief through an array of measures, including Voluntary Compliance/Conciliation Agreements, Consent Orders, and bringing charges under the Fair Housing Act.
On June 10, 2022, HUD issued guidance on the investigation of housing discrimination complaints that allege discrimination under the Fair Housing Act based on a housing provider's use of criminal records in tenant screening that specifically discusses how such practices can result in disability discrimination. The guidance describes the three ways in which a housing provider can discriminate against individuals with disabilities in violation of the Fair Housing Act when using applicants' or tenants' criminal history to reject rental applications or evict tenants from housing: intentional discrimination or disparate treatment, unjustified disparate impact, and refusal to grant reasonable accommodations that may be necessary for an individual with a disability to have an equal opportunity to enjoy and use a dwelling.
HUD has drafted a proposed Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule undergoing interagency review. HUD expects to publish the rule for public comment in the near future. The obligation of HUD funding recipients to affirmatively further fair housing requires them to consider and remedy disparities in housing opportunities for individuals with disabilities as well as people in other protected classes.
Increasing Integrated and Accessible Housing for People with Disabilities
HUD's Section 811 Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities Program aims to expand the supply of integrated affordable housing by providing capital advance funding for the development of permanent supportive rental housing for very-low-income persons with disabilities age 18 years or older. The program also provides project rental subsidies to maintain ongoing affordability over the next forty years. These units provide persons with disabilities the opportunity to live with dignity and independence within the community in an integrated environment that provides access to appropriate and voluntary supportive services.
HUD has provided over 1.2 million low-income families with decent, safe, and affordable housing via Project Based Rental Assistance (PBRA), including older adults and people with disabilities, to continue to live independently. When paired with quality voluntary supportive services, PBRA can help individuals with disabilities obtain and maintain community-based stable housing and avoid institutional settings.
In March 2021, HUD published findings from an analysis of 2019 American Housing Survey data (www.huduser.gov/portal/publications/Accessibility-in-Housing-Report.html) that provided a national estimate of the need for accessible housing units in America. The analysis found that 13 percent of U.S. households include someone who uses a mobility-assistive device, and 19 percent of households include an individual with accessibility needs. Further, 6 percent of households include someone who has difficulty entering the home, or accessing or using a kitchen, bathroom, or bedroom due to a physical disability or related condition.
HUD plans to issue an Advance Notice of Proposed Rule Making seeking public input on how it should update and revise its rule under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act to ensure that the programs and activities of recipients of federal financial assistance from HUD provide equal opportunity and equal access for individuals with disabilities. HUD will seek public comment on ways it can improve its Section 504 regulations and the accessibility standards for HUD-assisted facilities in order to ensure that individuals with disabilities truly have equal access to all HUD-assisted programs, activities, and facilities, such as public housing, affordable housing, homeownership programs, homeless shelters, and disaster recovery.
The Fair Housing Act requires all newly constructed multifamily housing with four or more units to comply with accessible design and construction requirements, so the housing is accessible to or adaptable for use by individuals with disabilities. To improve compliance with these requirements, HUD operates Fair Housing Accessibility First, a program that provides information, technical assistance, resources, and training on the accessible design and construction requirements of the Fair Housing Act.
HUD has promoted the adoption of accessibility standards in housing through Multifamily Federal Housing Administration mortgage insurance programs, which include requirements for borrower compliance with ADA and Section 504 accessibility standards for both new construction and refinancing of existing properties to ensure that both affordable and market rate properties are fully accessible to persons with disabilities. Mortgage insurance is often combined with HUD financial assistance or programs administered by state and local governments, and therefore, the accessible housing stock is continually increased.
HUD plans to develop a quick summary document of the existing resources, such as Notices and Guides, that provide guidance on the requirements of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA for Community Development Block Grants, HOME Investment Partnerships Program, and other programs administered by the Office of Community Planning and Development.

Individuals with disabilities are over-represented among people experiencing homelessness. HUD's data indicates that more than half of all people experiencing sheltered homelessness report having a disability. While national data is limited, local data indicates that this over-representation may be even higher among people who experience unsheltered homelessness, that is, people sleeping on the streets, in encampments, and other places not meant for human habitation. Through HUD's Office of Special Needs, HUD administers programs that provide community-based housing with voluntary supportive services to help individuals with disabilities, including HIV/AIDS, to transition from homelessness into permanent housing.
In March 2022, HUD awarded FY 2021 Continuum of Care Program grants totaling $1.749 billion to 4,056 permanent supportive housing projects, totaling 66.1% of all competition funding, assisting individuals with disabilities exit homelessness and achieve housing stability.
In December 2021, HUD funded 128 jurisdictions through Housing Opportunities for People with AIDS (HOPWA) formula awards totaling $387,000,000, which provided housing and services to people living with HIV/AIDS. That month, HUD also awarded $41 million in HOPWA competitive grants to 20 local governments and non-profit organizations through the HOPWA: Housing as an Intervention to Fight AIDS funding opportunity.
People with disabilities are significantly over-represented among people experiencing unsheltered homelessness, and in June 2022, HUD issued a first-of-its-kind funding package to address unsheltered homelessness including in rural areas. This funding packages includes $322 million in grants-including $54.5 million set-aside for rural areas-to fund homeless outreach, permanent housing, supportive services, interim housing, planning and data costs, as well as $43 million to fund 4,000 Housing Choice Vouchers."
07/01/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-122.cfm,HUD Announces Agreement with California Real Estate and Property Management Company,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has entered into a Conciliation Agreement with California property owners Joel and Christie A. Crowley, a property management company, Distinctive Properties Real Estate and Property Management, and property manager William Ware, resolving allegations that they discriminated against an interracial married couple on the basis of race and disability. A former employee of the Respondents allegedly made discriminatory statements and refused to provide an accessible parking space for the husband. Read the Conciliation Agreement here.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from discriminating because of race and disability. This includes making discriminatory statements and refusing to provide reasonable accommodations for persons with disabilities.
""Families deserve the right to enjoy their homes, free from discrimination,"" said Demetria L. McCain, HUD's Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD remains committed to ensuring that all housing providers meet their fair housing obligations.""
The case came to HUD's attention when a couple filed a complaint alleging that the housing providers discriminated against them because of race and disability. The complaint asserted that the property manager made discriminatory comments and that other tenants subjected them to racial slurs and threats. They also alleged that they were refused an accessible parking space.
Under the terms of the Agreement, the property owner has agreed to pay the couple $25,000, and Respondents have agreed to process any and all future requests made by or on behalf of applicants and/or residents for reasonable accommodation in a timely manner and provide fair housing training for their staff. Property owners Joel and Christie A. Crowley, property management company Distinctive Properties Real Estate and Property Management, and property manager William Ware deny any violation of the law, and their entering into the Conciliation Agreement does not constitute an admission by them or evidence of a determination by the Department of any violation of the Act or any other law.

07/01/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-123.cfm,HUD Judge Enters Order Settling Discrimination Claim Against Massachusetts Housing Provider,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that Blossom Associates, LLC and Maryanne Hart, the owner and operator of multiple rental units in Massachusetts, will pay $11,000 under a Consent Order resolving allegations that they refused to rent to a family because the family had children under the age of six. Read the Order.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to discriminate against families with children under the age of eighteen. This includes refusing to rent to families with minor children.
""When looking for safe and affordable housing, families shouldn't be penalized because they have children,"" said Demetria L. McCain, HUD's Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""This agreement reaffirms HUD's commitment to ensuring that housing providers follow fair housing laws and not discriminate against families who have children.""
The Order resolves allegations made by HUD in a charge of discrimination. The charge alleged that the family inquired on two occasions about renting a unit. Each time, Hart allegedly asked the parents if they had children and how old they were. Upon hearing the children were under 6, Hart allegedly replied that she would not rent the unit to a family with children under six years of age because the unit had lead paint. Massachusetts has lead paint laws that require housing providers to remediate lead paint in units where children under six live. The laws also create liability for housing providers if they do not remediate and young children suffer lead poisoning.
""Housing providers may not use lead laws as an excuse for refusing to rent to families with young children,"" said HUD General Counsel Damon Smith. ""HUD is committed to vigorously enforcing the Act to ensure that families with children can secure housing.""
Under the terms of the Consent Order, Blossom Associates, LLC and Hart will pay $11,000 to the family, complete fair housing training, include an inclusive statement in all future rental advertisements, and refrain from making disparaging written or oral statements about the family.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in housing because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, disability and familial status. People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY).

The transaction will preserve 299 low-income housing units, maintaining long term, stable, and affordable housing for low-income seniors and non-elderly disabled residents in Salt Lake County. Through RAD, the immediate and future needs of the project are addressed through the recapitalization, setting the project up for both financial and physical stability over the long-term.
The RAD transaction includes a $39.8 million construction budget ($133,110 per unit) fully financed through:
Commercial FHA-Insured Mortgage Loan 4% Low-Income Housing Tax Credits HOME Funds
• Commercial FHA-Insured Mortgage Loan
• 4% Low-Income Housing Tax Credits
• HOME Funds
Currently, the Housing Authority of Salt Lake City and the Housing Authority of the County of Salt Lake manage two adjacent buildings, the City Plaza and the County High Rise, separately as individual projects. While located on the same parcel, the two buildings have lacked any physical connection between them. Through RAD, the project will convert and renovate the two projects and manage them as one project post-conversion. The City owned property (City Plaza) and the County owned property (County High Rise) managed and owned by the Housing Authority of the County of Salt Lake will lead to a more efficient management of the two adjacent properties, enabling the Housing Authority to free up more funding up to be allocated towards other residential and affordable housing capital needs.
This project preserves much needed affordable housing in in downtown Salt Lake City, enabling residents to have access to affordable housing in an area close to jobs and opportunities. It will add a new one-story connecting breezeway to create a unified senior community in which residents have ease of access between these buildings. Additionally, all units will be updated with wiring for broadband during the rehabilitation. Finally, the rehabilitation will include important health and safety updates, including generators and access systems, unit and common area modernization, and other building and unit upgrades.
About RAD RAD was designed to help address the multi-billion-dollar nationwide backlog of deferred maintenance in the public housing portfolio and to stem the loss of affordable housing that could no longer be kept to decent standards. From the program's inception through June 1, 2022, the Rental Assistance Demonstration has facilitated more than $14.5 billion in capital investment to improve or replace nearly 175,000 deeply rent-assisted homes, most of which house extremely low-income families, seniors, and persons with disabilities.
Under RAD, projects funded under the public housing program convert their public housing assistance to project-based Section 8 rental assistance. Under Section 8, residents continue to pay 30% of their income towards rent and the housing must continue to serve those with very low and extremely low incomes, as was the case when the property was assisted through the public housing program. Residents must be notified and consulted prior to conversion, are given a right to return to assisted housing post-construction so that the same tenants can enjoy these newly preserved and improved apartments and maintain the same fundamental rights they had as public housing residents.

Read the Charge here.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from discriminating because of a tenant's gender identity. This includes prohibiting tenants from expressing their gender. HUD's Charge of Discrimination resulted from a complaint that the tenant filed with HUD. The Charge alleges that Mr. Dykgraaf violated the Act when he gave the tenant a letter stating that he was aware she was transitioning and telling her to act as a man, talk as a man, and dress as a man to avoid trouble.
""No one should have to change how they express their gender identity to maintain their housing,"" said Demetria L. McCain, HUD's Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Setting restrictions like these is not only unacceptable, it is illegal. This charge demonstrates HUD's commitment to enforcing the Fair Housing Act and ensuring housing providers meet their fair housing obligations.""
""The conduct alleged here provides a clear example of unlawful discrimination,"" said Damon Smith, HUD's General Counsel. ""This Charge makes clear that the Department will take action to stop housing providers from subjecting transgender tenants to such unlawful conduct.""
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an ALJ finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, the ALJ may award damages to the complainants for harm caused by the discrimination. The ALJ may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the ALJ may impose fines to vindicate the public interest. If the matter is decided in federal court, the federal district court judge may also award punitive damages.

The Agreement resolves allegations that the respondents discriminated against families with children by enacting overly restrictive rules targeting children's access to the property's common areas and enforcing a rule prohibiting personal items from being left in the common areas only against families with children. The respondents deny having discriminated against the complainants. Read the Agreement here.
""All members of the family, including children who are tenants, should be able to enjoy the safety and comfort of home,"" said Demetria L.

Fudge today announced Santa Clara County, California as the 100th community to join the Administration's House America initiative to tackle homelessness by leveraging American Rescue Plan and other federal resources through a Housing First approach. She also discussed House America's progress on the national level and the Biden-Harris Administration's efforts to make housing more affordable, fueled by investments from the American Rescue Plan.
Secretary Fudge made the announcement during a Zoom call with Santa Clara County Supervisor Susan Ellenberg, San José Mayor Sam Liccardo, Santa Clara County Housing Authority Executive Director Preston Prince, and Destination: Home CEO Jennifer Loving.
""Today, we are marking a major milestone for our House America initiative,"" said Secretary Fudge. ""Like many of the communities that have joined House America, Santa Clara County is committed to taking a Housing First approach to solving homelessness through affordable housing solutions and supportive services. We cannot continue to sweep and move encampments from one area to another or from one city to another and think we are solving the problem. Solving homelessness means recognizing and confronting the injustices that have led people—especially Black, brown, indigenous, and other people of color—to their tragic circumstances. Solving homelessness requires focus and the investment of time and resources. The elected officials across state and local government who have taken our House America pledge know it will take a robust, all-hands-on-deck effort to solve this crisis. Santa Clara County exemplifies what an all-hands-on deck effort looks like.""
""Stable housing is the first and essential step to achieving nearly every other determinant of health,"" said Supervisor Ellenberg. ""In the case of people who have been chronically unhoused or face other co-occurring challenges to self-sufficiency, Housing First must be accompanied by on site supportive services, which is precisely the model of Measure A funded permanent, supportive housing. We are on the right track and must continue to move forward: faster and more broadly and with greater community support.""
""I am proud that San Jose was one of the founding communities for the Biden Administration's House America initiative,"" said Mayor Liccardo. ""I look forward to continued federal investment, and our continued partnership with Santa Clara County and our Housing Authority, to bolster collaborative local efforts around permanent affordable and supportive housing, quick-build modular interim housing, and homelessness prevention.""
""Our goal is to be compassionate, collaborative and creative in our approach to solving homelessness,"" said Executive Director Prince. ""We are committed to bringing the resources we have to help solve this complicated issue. Our MTW status allows for flexibility with our partners, our vouchers support our families, and our capacity as a real estate developer adds much needed housing units to our community. Our Board has already committed over $1.5 billion over the next 20 years of federal assistance to support the development of affordable housing and will continue to dedicate more in support the most vulnerable members of this community.""
""No one entity can end homelessness on its own,"" said CEO Loving. ""In our community, we are intentional in how we work together - and this coordinated effort has allowed us to house 6,000 homeless individuals and reduce the inflow of new people falling into homeless by 30% in the last two years alone. Our progress shows what is possible when communities commit to addressing this moral crisis together, and with continued investment and support from our state and federal governments, we can end homelessness in this country.""
Launched in September 2021 by Secretary Fudge, in partnership with the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH), House America: An All-Hands-on-Deck Effort to Address the Nation's Homelessness Crisis is a federal initiative in which HUD and USICH are inviting mayors, city and county leaders, tribal nation leaders, and governors into a national partnership. House America utilizes the historic investments provided through the American Rescue Plan to address the crisis of homelessness through a Housing First approach. The initiative aims to re-house at least 100,000 households experiencing homelessness through a Housing First approach, and to add at least 20,000 new units of affordable housing into the development pipeline by December 31, 2022.
In a time when people experiencing homelessness are facing unprecedented challenges due to COVID-19 and its impacts on housing affordability and availability, communities have historic housing resources through the American Rescue Plan - 70,000 emergency housing vouchers, $5 billion in HOME-ARP grants, and significant investments to preserve and protect housing on tribal lands - to help more Americans obtain the safety of a stable home. The American Rescue Plan also provides $350 billion in State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds through the Department of the Treasury (https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/coronavirus/assistance-for-state-local-and-tribal-governments/state-and-local-fiscal-recovery-funds) to support the many needs communities face, including homelessness and housing instability, as they respond to the pandemic and its negative economic impacts. Communities also have resources through the CARES Act, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021, and other state, tribal, and local resources to re-house people experiencing homelessness and create additional dedicated housing units to address homelessness.
Since its launch in 2021, House America has made meaningful progress in addressing the homelessness crisis. Highlights to date include:
A total of 100 communities across 31 states and territories and the District of Columbia have joined House America. Together, these communities represent 50 percent of people experiencing homelessness in the U.S., per HUD's 2020 Point-in-Time Count (www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/ahar/2020-ahar-part-1-pit-estimates-of-homelessness-in-the-us.html). House America communities have shared with HUD their goals to collectively rehouse more than 57,000 households from homelessness and add more than 44,000 units of deeply affordable housing to development pipelines. HUD continues to work with communities that have recently joined House America to set their goals. From data available to HUD, the country is on track to meet the initiative's national goals. House America communities have been able to tap historic resources provided by the American Rescue Plan to support their public health and economic response to the pandemic. For example, the Administration has provided House America communities more than $50 billion in Treasury State and Local Fiscal Relief ARP funds that can be used for housing development, rental assistance, or services. In 2021 alone, hundreds of state and local governments committed billions of dollars in state and local funds provided by the American Rescue Plan to help people experiencing homelessness find safe, stable housing, including through permanent supportive housing and to increase the supply of affordable housing. House America communities have issued more than 95 percent of the 22,000 Emergency Housing Vouchers allocated to them through the American Rescue Plan, getting crucial resources to people who need them. House America communities have committed at least $400 million in Emergency Solutions Grants - CARES Act (ESG-CV) funds to Rapid Rehousing. CARES ESG-CV can fund housing, outreach, shelter, and related services. A fact sheet on House America progress is available here.

Through updates contained in Mortgagee Letter 2022-09, salaried and hourly wage-earners, as well as self-employed individuals affected by COVID-19, who now have stable income will have a greater opportunity to purchase a home using affordable FHA-insured mortgage financing.
""The changes we are announcing today further our efforts to facilitate recovery from COVID-19 and support access to homeownership, particularly for populations most deeply impacted by the pandemic,"" said Federal Housing Commissioner Julia Gordon. ""The pandemic affected the livelihoods of tens of millions of workers in this country, particularly workers of color and those at the lower end of the wage scale. Limiting these families' homeownership opportunities because of the unavoidable impacts of an unprecedented global health crisis, when they are otherwise well-qualified for a mortgage, is unnecessary and contrary to this Administration's goals and FHA's mission.""
FHA defines a COVID-19 related economic event as a temporary loss of employment, temporary reduction of income, or temporary reduction of hours worked during the Presidentially Declared COVID-19 National Emergency. The guidance announced today includes provisions for salaried and non-salaried wage earners and addresses the needs of those who are employed full-time, self-employed, employed part-time, earn bonus or tip income, and/or earn commission income. Lenders may begin using the new policies immediately but must implement the new policies for FHA case numbers assigned on or after September 5, 2022."

07/11/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-131.cfm,"HUD Administrative Law Judge Orders Long Island Landlord to Pay over $70,000 for Discriminating Against Daughter with Disabilities and her Mothers","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced today that an Administrative Law Judge found a landlord violated the Fair Housing Act when he refused to rent to a mother and her daughter because of the daughter's cerebral palsy. On June 7, 2021, HUD charged Alex Raimos with violating the Act. On June 22, 2022, a HUD Administrative Law Judge agreed, ordering Raimos to pay $50,530 in damages to the family and a $20,111 civil penalty to the United States. Read the ALJ's Decision and Order.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from discriminating because of disability. This includes refusing to rent because of a person's disability.
""Persons with disabilities have been protected from discrimination in housing by the Fair Housing Act for more than 30 years, yet they continue to be subjected to discriminatory treatment,"" said Demetria L. McCain, HUD Principal Assistant Deputy Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD is committed to vigorously enforcing the Act to protect the rights of individuals with disabilities.""
""The fact that a landlord would refuse to rent to a family because a child has disabilities is inexcusable,"" said HUD's General Counsel, Damon Smith. ""This decision should make clear to other housing providers that such actions are also illegal and costly.""
The ALJ found that the woman attempted to rent an apartment owned by Raimos. Raimos agreed to rent to the woman and accepted her security deposit. But after learning that the daughter had disabilities, he retracted his agreement to rent. The family then had to move in with relatives. The ALJ found that the ""outright refusal to rent is arguably the most egregious form of fair housing violation, as it completely denies an individual a valuable housing opportunity. To put Complainant and her disabled child through two months of anticipation, excitement and hope only then to take it away because of her child's cerebral palsy is reprehensible.""
People who believe they are the victims of housing discrimination should contact HUD at (800) 669-9777 (voice) 800-927-9275 (TTY). Additional information is available at www.hud.gov/fairhousing.

President Biden created the Justice40 Initiative to deliver 40% of the overall benefits of climate, clean energy, affordable and sustainable housing, clean water, and other investments to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized, underserved, and overburdened by pollution.
""HUD's mission is rooted squarely in service to disadvantaged communities and to ensuring equity and justice for the communities we serve. As an agency, we are committed to supporting neighborhoods that have been disinvested for generations and overburdened by pollution and the impacts of climate change,"" said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""I am happy to announce that 24 of HUD's programs align with President Biden's goal to address environmental injustice by investing in underserved communities.""
The programs included in today's announcement create affordable and sustainable housing and meet a range of different housing needs for individuals and communities, including single- and multi-family housing and housing for seniors, persons with disabilities, and tribal communities. The programs also serve communities that have been impacted by disasters, and that need to partner with the federal government to spur local economic growth. These HUD programs align directly with President Biden's historic initiative to address environmental justice and make sure no communities are left behind.
By releasing HUD's list of covered programs, communities and the general public will have greater visibility and transparency into the role HUD plays in the federal government's coordinated effort to support disadvantaged communities that are marginalized, underserved, and overburdened by pollution and other impacts of climate change.

07/19/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-133.cfm,HUD Proposes Updates to Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - The Department of Housing and Urban Development announced today its proposals for updating the Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards, commonly referred to as the ""HUD Code."" The proposed updates were published in the Federal Register (www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/07/19/2022-14701/manufactured-home-construction-and-safety-standards) and are the largest set of changes to the HUD Code in over two decades. The updates support the Biden-Harris Administration's priority of expanding the supply of manufactured housing as a component of its efforts to address the nation's housing supply challenges.
""Manufactured homes are an important element of the nation's affordable housing supply,"" said Assistant Secretary for Housing Julia Gordon. ""These proposed updates, when final, will help to expand the availability of safe and affordable homes that align with current design trends and construction methods.""
Containing new and updated standards, including 88 standards incorporated by reference, the proposed rule will bring the HUD Code in line with more recent manufactured housing industry standards and further improve the quality and safety of manufactured home construction. Proposed changes in the rule will facilitate innovation and greater production of manufactured homes with features that are sought-after by consumers and that are common consumer needs for modern living, including: multi-unit dwellings; ridge-roof designs; open floor plans, truss designs, specifications for attics, and accessibility improvements, among others.
When final, the updates contained in the proposed rule will enact a significant number of recommendations made by the federally-mandated Manufactured Housing Consensus Committee. Further, the updates will eliminate the need for manufacturers to obtain alternative construction approvals for frequently requested features and materials that already meet or exceed HUD standards.
The proposed updates are available for public comment for 60 days. Comments must be submitted via the methods described in the proposed rule."
07/19/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-134.cfm,HUD Charges Wyoming Homeowners Association with Disability Discrimination,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is charging Spring Creek Homeowners Association, the governing body of approximately 131 residential housing units in Jackson, Wyoming, with discriminating against two homeowners because of disability by imposing restrictions on their assistance animals and retaliating against them for filing a Fair Housing Act complaint. Read HUD's Charge.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination because of disability. This includes refusing to allow reasonable accommodations that would otherwise permit homeowners with disabilities an equal opportunity to use and enjoy their housing. A reasonable accommodation includes a waiver of rules restricting pets. The Act also prohibits retaliating against individuals because they have filed a fair housing complaint with HUD.
""Many people with disabilities rely on assistance animals to live in their homes and enjoy the benefits of their residential communities,"" said Demetria L. McCain, HUD Principal Assistant Deputy Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD is committed to challenging impermissible attempts to limit use of assistance animals.""
""Today's action should remind housing providers, including HOAs, that they must make exceptions to restrictive pet rules for individuals with disabilities in need of assistance animals,"" said HUD General Counsel Damon Smith. ""HUD will continue to enforce the Fair Housing Act to ensure that individuals with disabilities have equal access to housing and are not subjected to retaliation for exercising their fair housing rights.""
HUD's Charge of Discrimination alleges that Spring Creek Homeowners Association employed rules limiting the rights of residents with assistance animals, including requiring documentation typically provided to certain airlines, and permitting assistance dogs to be walked only outside the Spring Creek property and to relieve themselves on property only in the early morning or late evening. After the homeowners challenged these policies and filed a complaint with HUD, Spring Creek Homeowners Association sent a letter to all residents in the community admonishing the homeowners for attempting to circumvent the HOA's arbitration provisions and publicly questioning the homeowners' need for their assistance dogs.
A United States Administrative Law Judge will hear HUD's charge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds, after a hearing, that discrimination has occurred, the judge may award damages to the homeowners for their losses as a result of the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, to deter further discrimination, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties to vindicate the public interest. If the federal court hears the case, the judge may also award punitive damages to the complainant.

07/26/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-135.cfm,HUD and Census Bureau Report New Residential Sales in June 2022,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Census Bureau jointly announced the following new residential sales statistics for June 2022:

New Home Sales
Sales of new single-family houses in June 2022 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 590,000, according to estimates released jointly by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. This is 8.1 percent (±15.0 percent)* below the revised May rate of 642,000 and is 17.4 percent (±11.6 percent) below the June 2021 estimate of 714,000.
Sales Price
The median sales price of new houses sold in June 2022 was $402,400. The average sales price was $456,800.
For Sale Inventory and Months' Supply
The seasonally-adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of June was 457,000. This represents a supply of 9.3 months at the current sales rate.
Read more about new residential sales activity (www.census.gov/construction/nrs/index.html).
EXPLANATORY NOTES
These statistics are estimated from sample surveys. They are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated average relative standard errors of the preliminary data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. Changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show irregular movement. It takes 4 months to establish a trend for new houses sold. Preliminary new home sales figures are subject to revision due to the survey methodology and definitions used. The survey is primarily based on a sample of houses selected from building permits. Since a ""sale"" is defined as a deposit taken or sales agreement signed, this can occur prior to a permit being issued. An estimate of these prior sales is included in the sales figure. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimate of total sales is revised about 5.8 percent. Changes in sales price data reflect changes in the distribution of houses by region, size, etc., as well as changes in the prices of houses with identical characteristics. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau's website (www.census.gov/construction/nrs/how_the_data_are_collected/index.html).
* The 90 percent confidence interval includes zero. In such cases, there is insufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero."
07/27/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-136.cfm,Biden Administration Announces Steps to Lower Electricity Bills for Residents in HUD Programs,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - The Biden Administration, through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, announced today new measures to connect families served by HUD programs to solar power and help lower their electricity bills. Over 4.5 million low-income families are currently served by HUD programs. In addition to today's announcement, HUD will continue to connect and convene stakeholders in regional and local offices to highlight federal funding sources - including funding streams from President Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and HUD programs such as Home Investment Partnerships Program and Community Development Block Grant HOME and CDBG that can be used to improve energy efficiency and lower utility costs for communities including HUD-assisted properties and residents.
""The combination of extreme heat and rising utility prices creates a perfect storm, and HUD-assisted families and communities are some of the most vulnerable,"" said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""The steps announced today by the Biden Administration will not only help families reduce utility costs, but also provide an opportunity for HUD-assisted residents to participate in the clean energy economy through local community solar programs.""
Below is information about how HUD will leverage specific programs and take new steps to help ease energy cost burdens through Community Solar, HUD's Small Rural Frozen Rolling Base Utility Program, FHA's 203(k) Rehabilitation Mortgage Insurance Program, FHA's Financing and Energy Efficient and Climate Mitigation Home Improvements, and FHA Education and Outreach.
New Guidance to Connect Families to Solar Power
HUD is issuing national guidance to help ensure that residents of assisted housing can access cost-saving community solar subscriptions. With this guidance, HUD sets the stage for 4.5 million families to reap the benefits of community solar which, on average, can save families 10% per year on their electric bills. In some programs, such as the Washington, DC Solar for All program, savings from subscribing to local community solar can reach up to 50% per year. This national guidance builds on recent state-specific guidance that HUD has provided to Illinois, Washington, DC and New York, that determined community-net-metering (CNM) credits would be excluded from household income and utility allowance calculations and therefore not increase housing costs for residents in properties participating in HUD Multifamily, Public Housing and Housing Choice Voucher rental assistance programs.
Guidance can be found HERE.
Small Rural Frozen Rolling Base Utility Program
Last year, HUD implemented new statutory changes creating a new energy and water savings incentive program for Small Rural housing authorities. The Small Rural Frozen Rolling Base program enables small rural housing authorities to retain utility cost savings from efficiency or capital investments from conservation measures. Now, HUD is launching an educational campaign and partnership to encourage broader usage of the incentive, and help housing authorities partner with Weatherization providers to access low-cost energy efficiency measures. HUD will make public a list of eligible Rural housing authorities, as well as a list of buildings owned or operated by those Housing Authorities that meet the new categorical income eligibility requirements for the Department of Energy Weatherization program. Leading up to the September deadline for new applicants for the Frozen Rolling Base program, HUD will maximize outreach efforts to ensure eligible housing authorities are aware of the savings opportunities.
Read more about the Small Rural Frozen Rolling Base program here and see list of Eligible Public Housing Authorities here. The list of properties meeting income eligibility requirements for the Department of Energy's Weatherization program is available here.
FHA's 203(k) Rehabilitation Mortgage Insurance Program
Given the urgent need for utility cost savings, HUD is working to educate lenders and homebuyers about the products the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) offers for energy-related improvements that may help homeowners reduce their utility costs.
The 203(k) Rehabilitation Mortgage Insurance program is FHA's primary program for the rehabilitation and repair of single-family properties. It is flexible and makes it easy to incorporate the costs of repairs into a loan when purchasing a home or refinancing a current mortgage. The eligible improvements include energy efficiency upgrades, energy-saving equipment, and energy generation improvements. The Limited 203(k) Mortgage permits homebuyers and homeowners to finance up to $35,000 into their mortgage to repair, improve, or upgrade their home. In Qualified Opportunity Zones (QOZ), the amount is up to $50,000 per home, enough to make a range of important and cost saving energy improvements. FHA Education and Outreach HUD Homeownership Centers offer training sessions on FHA products, programs, and policies throughout the year which includes the 203(k), Energy Efficient Mortgage, Weatherization, and Solar and Wind programs. These trainings are offered live and may be recorded; an example is the 2022 Single Family Housing Lender Training - Credit Underwriting: Session II (located here) conducted in June. FHA is considering ways to make it easier for lenders and consumers to use the 203(k) Rehabilitation-Mortgage Program to make a range of home improvements, including those related to climate mitigation and energy efficiency improvements. When these changes are in place, FHA will execute a robust education and outreach plan to update consumers and lenders. FHA is working with the appraisal community to develop strategies to ensure single family appraisers are aware of approaches for valuing energy- and hazard-mitigation-related improvements. Contact an FHA-approved lender for more information on the Section 203(k) Rehabilitation Mortgage Program or visit HUD's 203(k) Rehabilitation Mortgage Insurance Program web page.

08/01/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-140.cfm,HUD Announces $2.8 Billion to Help People Experiencing Homelessness,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced that it will provide $2.8 billion in competitive funding to homeless services organizations across the country for supportive services and housing programs for people experiencing homelessness. The funding opportunity reflects the Biden-Harris Administration's continued commitment to equity and evidence-based solutions to address homelessness. It also reinforces the Administration's commitment to boost housing supply and lower costs by supporting local engagement to increase the supply of affordable housing. Read HUD's Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) (www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=342855).
""Every person deserves to live with dignity and security in safe, stable, and affordable home,"" said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""Coupled with the historic resources in President Biden's American Rescue Plan, the Continuum of Care Program grants made available by HUD today will help more Americans experiencing homelessness move into homes and access critical supportive services like health care, education, and job training. HUD and the Administration continue to prioritize equity in homelessness efforts and the humane treatment of people experiencing unsheltered homelessness, and the funding announced today will help communities do just that.""
The FY 2022 competitive funding will be awarded through HUD's Continuum of Care Program, the largest source of federal grant funding for homeless services and housing programs serving people experiencing homelessness. Nearly 400 Continuum of Care communities apply for the NOFO each year. HUD funds approximately 7,000 homeless services projects annually through the Continuum of Care Program.
As with prior NOFOs, Continuums of Care will have the opportunity to renew existing projects, apply for new projects, and to reallocate resources from lower performing projects to better serve people experiencing homelessness. However, this year's NOFO includes some new opportunities.
In FY2022, access to the CoC Program has been further expanded for Indian Tribes and Tribally Designated Housing entities who are now invited to form CoCs and be designated as Collaborative Applicants.
Additionally, the NOFO contains explicit funding for (1) survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking; and (2) youth. The NOFO will provide at least $52 million for new rapid re-housing, supportive services, and other activities critical to assist survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking. Approximately $80 million is available for non-competitive Youth Homelessness Demonstration Program (YHDP) renewal and replacement expiring grants.
Specifically, HUD is seeking projects that:
End homelessness for all persons experiencing homelessness; Place emphasis on racial equity and anti-discrimination polices for LGTBQ+ individuals; Use a Housing First approach; Reduce unsheltered homelessness and reduce the criminalization of homelessness; Improve system performance; Partner with housing agencies to leverage access to mainstream housing programs; Partner with health agencies to coordinate health and supportive services, including to prevent and respond to future infectious disease outbreaks; Advance racial equity and addressing racial disparities in homelessness; Engage people with lived experience of homelessness in decision-making; and Support local engagement to increase the supply of affordable housing.

08/03/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-141.cfm,"HUD Closes $33.3 Million Rental Assistance Demonstration Conversion with Housing Authority of the City of Atlanta, Georgia, Preserving 114 Affordable Rental Homes at the Village at Castleberry Hill Site","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Office of Multifamily Housing announced today that it has closed a Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) transaction with the Housing Authority of the City of Atlanta, Georgia, to preserve affordable housing at its 20-building Villages at Castleberry Hill development. Through RAD, the Housing Authority will preserve 114 affordable rental homes as deeply affordable Section 8 homes as well as 114 affordable, Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) homes.
The RAD transaction includes a $33.3 million construction budget ($117,000 per unit) fully financed through:
Commercial First Mortgage Loan 4% Low-Income Housing Tax Credits
• Commercial First Mortgage Loan
• 4% Low-Income Housing Tax Credits
Through RAD, the immediate and future needs of the Village at Castleberry Hill project are addressed through the recapitalization, setting the project up for both financial and physical stability over the long-term. This transaction is the second phase of this development, following a 166-affordable rental home phase one project which preserved 102 affordable homes and closed in June 2018. The Village at Castleberry Hill is located near the Atlanta University Center, as well as the city's quickly developing Westside and within a mile from the Vine City MARTA station. With this RAD transaction, the Housing Authority has been able to change the unit configuration to allow for 57 of the existing 113 market rate units to be converted to affordable LIHTC units.
About RAD RAD was designed to help address the multi-billion-dollar nationwide backlog of deferred maintenance in the public housing portfolio and to stem the loss of affordable housing that could no longer be kept to decent standards. From the program's inception through June 1, 2022, the Rental Assistance Demonstration has facilitated more than $14.5 billion in capital investment to improve or replace nearly 175,000 deeply rent-assisted homes, most of which house extremely low-income families, seniors, and persons with disabilities.
Under RAD, projects funded under the public housing program convert their public housing assistance to project-based Section 8 rental assistance. Under Section 8, residents continue to pay 30% of their income towards rent and the housing must continue to serve those with very low and extremely low incomes, as was the case when the property was assisted through the public housing program. Residents must be notified and consulted prior to conversion, are given a right to return to assisted housing post-construction so that the same tenants can enjoy these newly preserved and improved apartments and maintain the same fundamental rights they had as public housing residents.

08/04/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-142.cfm,HUD Releases Economic Justice Agenda to Help Low-Income Renters Build Assets,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today released an agenda for economic justice that describes actions the department will take to help low-income renters build assets, along with a Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) for $113 million for the Family Self-Sufficiency (FSS) program to help HUD-assisted families increase earned income and improve financial stability.
HUD's agenda, Bridging the Wealth Gap: An Agenda for Economic Justice and Asset Building for Renters, focuses on asset building through increased savings, access to mainstream banking, and credit score improvement. By integrating asset building, anti-poverty policies can more directly facilitate economic stability for millions of Americans.
HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge announced Bridging the Wealth Gap and the $113 million funding opportunity during a conversation today with Axios on affordable and fair housing. Watch Secretary Fudge's conversation with Axios here (www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6V4eFRuN_w).
""With Bridging the Wealth Gap and this historic funding opportunity, we're trying to make sure that every single person in this country can get their piece of the American dream,"" said Secretary Fudge. ""We're looking at everything through a lens of equity and how we address systemic racism. We're giving people who have historically been left out and underserved the resources to take a chance on their futures – to improve their credit, save resources for homeownership and other needs, and build wealth. That's what this is all about.""
Unequal access to savings, positive credit history, and banking is a national problem that especially impacts renters and contributes to the racial wealth gap. This leaves renters with a minimal safety net to draw from in times of unemployment or unanticipated expenses such as car repair or medical emergencies. For example, less than half (www.bankrate.com/banking/savings/emergency-savings-survey-july-2021/) of American households have three months of savings. In 2019, the median cash savings of renter households (www.jchs.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/reports/files/Harvard_JCHS_Americas_Rental_Housing_2022.pdf) was $1,400 compared to homeowner cash savings of $10,100.
Bridging the Wealth Gap focuses on helping low-income families safely access financial institutions and tools, which federal programs have not typically focused on. Bridging the Wealth Gap expands HUD's work to build a critical continuum between federal rental assistance and homeownership programs by helping renters in HUD programs take the necessary first steps toward financial well-being and potential homeownership through saving, credit building, and banking. This agenda outlines the expansion of asset building practices for renters as a reparative tool for economic justice.
Specifically, Bridging the Wealth Gap announces the following current and future actions HUD is taking to promote asset building:
Current Asset Building Actions
Launch the Asset Building Moving to Work (MTW) Demonstration Expand Asset Building Programs like the Family Self-Sufficiency Program Move from Annual to Triennial Income Recertification Support Renters with Credit and Financial Counseling Help HUD-Assisted Young Adults Save Partner with Other Federal Agencies and Stakeholders
• Launch the Asset Building Moving to Work (MTW) Demonstration
• Expand Asset Building Programs like the Family Self-Sufficiency Program
• Move from Annual to Triennial Income Recertification
• Support Renters with Credit and Financial Counseling
• Help HUD-Assisted Young Adults Save
• Partner with Other Federal Agencies and Stakeholders
Future Asset Building Actions
Build Credit History Through Rent Reporting Integrate Financial Well-Being and Supportive Services into PHA Standard Practice Improve Homeownership Programs and Supports for HUD-Assisted Renters
• Build Credit History Through Rent Reporting
• Integrate Financial Well-Being and Supportive Services into PHA Standard Practice
• Improve Homeownership Programs and Supports for HUD-Assisted Renters
The $113 million-dollar Family Self-Sufficiency (FSS) NOFO released today is a historic expansion of the program and central to HUD's agenda for economic justice. The FSS program is the nation's largest asset-building program for low-income families. The program currently serves around 65,000 participants at over 700 Public Housing Authorities (PHAs). FSS is a voluntary program that uses a combination of coordination of services and supports from community partners and an escrow savings account to help participants grow their earned income and savings and increase their financial well-being overall. Upon graduation from the program, the average family participating in FSS in 2021 had about $9,500 in savings.
On May 17, 2022, HUD published a new FSS rule (www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/05/17/2022-09528/streamlining-and-implementation-of-economic-growth-regulatory-relief-and-consumer-protection-act), a critical step towards making FSS available to even more families. Among its changes, the rule permits any adult household member, not only the official head of household, to enroll in the program and eliminates regulations that were potential barriers to program graduation. The rule also eliminates a cap on savings that had been in place for higher-income families.
HUD anticipates being able to fund new FSS programs, in addition to renewals, through the $113 million funding opportunity announced today. For the first time, owners of Multifamily properties participating in the Section 8 assisted housing program are eligible to apply for funding under this grant opportunity. The FY22 FSS NOFO competition was posted to Grants.gov (www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=342969) and HUD.gov on August 4, 2022, with an application deadline of October 3, 2022."

WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it will make available $10 million in Rural Capacity Building grants. The Rural Capacity Building (RCB) program enhances the capacity and ability of rural housing development organizations, Community Development Corporations (CDCs), Community Housing Development Organizations (CHDOs), rural local governments, and Indian tribes to carry out affordable housing and community development activities in rural areas for the benefit of low- and moderate-income families and persons.
""HUD is committed to ensuring that federal resources reach rural Americans,"" said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""Through this opportunity, rural communities can access critical resources for affordable housing and community-led development, improving economic outcomes and quality of life for Americans in rural areas.""
RCB provides competitive funding to national organizations with expertise in rural housing and rural community development who work directly to build the capacity of eligible beneficiaries. These national intermediary organizations will support local eligible beneficiaries to spur affordable housing activities and community development in some of America's most underserved rural communities. Through the RCB program, national organizations provide training, technical assistance, and financial support to local beneficiaries, helping them serve hundreds of low-income or low- and moderate-income families and persons in rural areas.
The deadline for submitting applications for FY 2021 and FY 2022 Rural Capacity Building grants is 11:59 PM EST on October 11, 2022.

ANCHORAGE - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Deputy Secretary Adrianne Todman was in Alaska this week to discuss Tribal housing supply with local leaders and organizations across the state. Over the past two years, HUD has awarded Alaskan Tribal entities and Native Villages unprecedented funding, a testament to the Biden-Harris Administration's focus on equity and inclusion.
The Deputy Secretary delivered remarks at the Association of Alaska Housing Authorities and Enterprise Community Partners' Housing Innovation Summit where she announced an increase in the number of Tribal entities participating in a HUD program that provides rental assistance and supportive services to American Indian and Alaska Native Veterans experiencing or at-risk of experiencing homelessness. While in Anchorage, she met with a variety of housing partners and leaders including the Alaska Association of Housing Authorities, the Knik Tribal Council, Alaska Housing Finance Corporation, Covenant House, and the Cook Inlet Housing Authority.
Deputy Secretary Todman also visited the YK Delta to meet with the Association of Village Council Presidents Regional Housing Authority (AVCP RHA) and the Orutsararmiut Native Council in Bethel and traveled upriver by boat to the Tribal Villages of Oscarville and Napakiak to meet with Tribal leaders in their homes and learn about their housing challenges.
""I met so many passionate and outcome-focused leaders who told me about Alaska's unique challenges - and opportunities - when it comes to building homes, repairing them, and creating more resilient communities in the face of climate change,"" said Deputy Secretary Todman. ""From innovations around constructing homes in cold climates, to working with the realities of building in remote communities with restricted construction windows, the Alaskan housing community are true innovators. HUD's job now is to improve upon the resources and technical assistance we provide and make sure it's working as efficiently as possible for the communities who need them.""
During a plenary session at the Alaska Housing Innovation Summit, Bryan Butcher, CEO/Executive Director of Alaska Housing Finance Corporation applauded the Deputy Secretary's visit by saying, ""The Deputy Secretary is today visiting Bethel, Oscarville and Napakiak - communities outside of Anchorage, inaccessible by road and each with unique challenges and opportunities. We know there is no substitute for on-the-ground experience, and we should recognize her and her team for their interest in learning about the people, their traditional ways of life, and the environment where they live day-to-day.""
Over the past two years, HUD has awarded nearly $285 million in Indian Housing Block Grant (IHBG) formula funding to Tribal entities in Alaska, with more funding on the way. In FY 2022, HUD awarded $115 million in IHBG formula funds, which is a 22-percent increase from FY 2021. In
FY 2021, Tribal entities also received $64 million in IHBG-ARP funding, over $10 million in IHBG competitive funding, and over $86 million in ICDBG-ARP funding.

08/16/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-151.cfm,"HUD Awards $34 Million Loan Guarantee to Cincinnati, OH for Affordable Housing","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced a $34 million loan guarantee for Cincinnati, Ohio for the Affordable Housing Loan Fund Project to spur the creation of more affordable housing.
This upfront source of financing, awarded through HUD's Section 108 Loan Guarantee Program (Section 108) program, is the lynchpin of the city's strategy to leverage public and private resources to deliver more affordable housing units in the market. To maximize market impacts and leverage expertise, the city undertook development of new financing tools and programming in partnership with the local non-profit organization Cincinnati Development Fund (CDF), which is a local Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI) and Community Development Entity (CDE), to execute program initiatives supported by the loan pool. In turn, the city will be better able to drive private investment, add housing units throughout the city, eliminate concentrations of poverty, and allow developers to take on projects with greater financing risks in marginalized neighborhoods.
""Communities all over the country need more capital to develop and preserve affordable housing. This loan guarantee will catalyze reinvestment of private dollars into the city to address this need,"" said Marion McFadden, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary, Office of Community Planning and Development at HUD. ""I commend Mayor Pureval and his team for maximizing the resources available for affordable housing.""
The Section 108 program provides Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) recipients with the ability to leverage their annual grant allocation to access low-cost, flexible financing for economic development, housing, public facility, and infrastructure projects. This project will benefit low- and moderate-income persons by providing permanent residential structures, which will be primarily occupied by low- and moderate-income households.
The Section 108 program allows local governments to leverage five times their current CDBG award into federally guaranteed loans large enough to pursue physical and economic revitalization projects capable of redeveloping entire neighborhoods. Public investment, such as Section 108 loans, can spur private economic activity, providing the resources or the confidence that private firms and individuals may need to invest in distressed areas. Read more about HUD's Section 108 Loan Guarantee Program (www.hudexchange.info/programs/section-108/).
As the need for economic recovery and community development continues, HUD's Section 108 program serves as a critical source of federal financing that helps to move projects forward and build strong, sustainable, inclusive communities"

Federal Housing Commissioner: Green MIP pricing will ""support the Biden-Harris Administration's climate goals and HUD's Climate Action Plan""
WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) announced today that is has issued implementation guidance for lenders to obtain a reduction of upfront and annual mortgage insurance premiums (MIP) on most Section 232 Residential Care Facility mortgages for subject properties that meet industry-recognized green building certifications and that will achieve meaningful and measurable energy and water efficiency improvements. Announced in its May 19, 2022 (www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/05/19/2022-10539/changes-in-certain-office-of-healthcare-programs-insurance-premiums), and August 12, 2022 (www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/08/12/2022-17306/changes-in-certain-office-of-healthcare-programs-insurance-premiums-correction), Federal Register notices, the ""Green MIP"" reductions decrease both capitalized upfront MIP and annual MIP rates to 25 basis points. The new rates go into effect for mortgages on eligible facilities for FHA mortgage insurance firm commitments issued or reissued on or after October 1, 2022.
""We want to make sure that the imperative to address climate change is compatible with the need to ensure the availability of residential care in communities,"" said Federal Housing Commissioner Julia Gordon. ""The Green MIP pricing will provide financial incentives to increase the energy and water efficiency of these facilities, which will not only support the Biden-Harris Administration's climate goals and HUD's Climate Action Plan, but also ultimately reduce operating costs for these facilities.""
This reduction is designed to encourage owners of nursing homes, assisted living facilities, board and care homes, and intermediate care facilities to adopt standards for construction, rehabilitation, repairs, maintenance, and property operations that are more efficient and sustainable than are customary for such facilities.

New Home Sales
Sales of new single-family houses in July 2022 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 511,000, according to estimates released jointly by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. This is 12.6 percent (±16.9 percent)* below the revised June rate of 585,000 and is 29.6 percent (±10.9 percent)* below the July 2021 estimate of 726,000.
Sales Price
The median sales price of new houses sold in July 2022 was $439,400. The average sales price was $546,800.
For Sale Inventory and Months' Supply

EXPLANATORY NOTES
These statistics are estimated from sample surveys. They are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated average relative standard errors of the preliminary data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. Changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show irregular movement. It takes 4 months to establish a trend for new houses sold. Preliminary new home sales figures are subject to revision due to the survey methodology and definitions used. The survey is primarily based on a sample of houses selected from building permits. Since a ""sale"" is defined as a deposit taken or sales agreement signed, this can occur prior to a permit being issued. An estimate of these prior sales is included in the sales figure. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimate of total sales is revised about 5.8 percent. Changes in sales price data reflect changes in the distribution of houses by region, size, etc., as well as changes in the prices of houses with identical characteristics. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau's website (www.census.gov/construction/nrs/how_the_data_are_collected/index.html).
* The 90 percent confidence interval includes zero. In such cases, there is insufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero."

This Public Housing Operating Fund Shortfall funding, provided by the Fiscal Year 2022 Consolidated Appropriations Act, will enable PHAs to continue serving residents as they take steps to ensure long-term financial solvency.
""Public housing agencies, like other organizations, have been impacted by financial disruptions from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic,"" said Dominque Blom, General Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing at HUD. ""Supporting PHAs in this way is critical to serving HUD-assisted households. These funds stabilize PHAs so that they can meet the needs of residents and taking steps toward long-term financial stability.""
PHA awardees facing shortfalls are defined as having less than three months of operating expenses held in reserve. While PHAs of various sizes may have been eligible to receive funding, HUD is concerned with the ability of small and very-small PHAs to generate resources to supplement their public housing program, and therefore prioritized these PHAs in the distribution of funds. The list of awardees is available here.
To establish that PHAs that receive Shortfall funding take appropriate steps to ensure long-term financial solvency, HUD will undertake the additional monitoring of all PHAs that receive funding under this category. Additionally, HUD has identified and informed the PHAs of recommended actions that the PHAs can take to improve their financial performance. PHAs that receive Shortfall funding are required to develop a plan identifying action items the PHA can take to improve their financial performance.

WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today issued a notice that explains the department's non-competitive allocation strategy and program requirements for the new Stability Vouchers. Under the program, HUD will award up to $43,439,000 to support approximately 4,000 new incremental vouchers with the goal of encouraging a community-wide commitment to the goal of ending homelessness through a coordinated, Housing First approach. Read HUD's notice here.
""Along with the $322 million in Continuum of Care grants that HUD recently announced, the Stability Vouchers will enable communities to partner with health and housing agencies to coordinate their efforts to reduce homelessness and help thousands of people move off the streets into permanent housing,"" said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""These vouchers also offer housing agencies more flexibility to maximize families' ability to find housing of their choosing. This flexibility has helped communities use Emergency Housing Vouchers from the American Rescue Plan to quickly meet housing needs. The Biden-Harris Administration is leading a historic expansion of housing vouchers, which includes permanent vouchers like these and Emergency Housing Vouchers. In the coming weeks, we look forward to announcing our further expansion of the Housing Choice Voucher program to serve more families.""
The roughly $43 million for the 4,000 new incremental vouchers is part of a first-of-its-kind package of resources to address unsheltered homelessness and homeless encampments, including funds set aside specifically to address homelessness in rural communities. The package, announced by HUD in June, also includes $322 million in Continuum of Care Program to fund homeless outreach, permanent housing, supportive services, and other costs. HUD expects communities to partner with health and housing agencies to leverage mainstream housing and health care. The notice announced today is designed to direct Stability Vouchers to PHAs partnering with Continuums of Care and Victim Service providers to implement coordinated approaches to reduce the prevalence of homelessness, improve service engagement and promote housing stability while ensuring geographical need of assistance.
The Stability Voucher Program is similar to the successful Emergency Housing Voucher Program (EHVs), funded by the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) in that they include programmatic flexibilities to help families successfully secure a unit. In coupling Stability Vouchers with CoC-funded supportive services, families can be provided resources and services that will help them to obtain and maintain housing.
To be eligible to receive an SV funding allocation, a PHA must currently administer an HCV program. Non-profit agencies that only administer Mainstream vouchers are not eligible to receive an SV allocation. The non-competitive allocation formula will be based on estimates of household experiencing or at risk of homelessness by geography. The PHAs will be invited to apply for a specific number of Stability Vouchers once they have expressed an interest in the program by sending a response to StabilityVouchers@hud.gov.
In order to be eligible for an SV, a household must meet one of four eligibility criteria:
• Individuals and families who are currently experiencing homelessness;
• Individuals and families at risk of homelessness;
• Individuals and families fleeing or attempting to flee domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, sexual assault; and
• Veterans and families that include a veteran family that meet one of the preceding criteria (a-c).
All Registrations of Interest must be sent to StabilityVouchers@hud.gov no later than 11:59:59 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on October 20, 2022."

WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Office of Multifamily Housing announced today that it has closed a Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) transaction with the Franklin Housing Authority in the City of Franklin, TN. Through RAD, the Housing Authority will newly construct 76 affordable rental homes at their Cherokee Place property as part of a multi-phase affordable rental housing development plan for the property. When complete, the property will have 12 deeply affordable Section 8 rental assistance homes, 48 affordable homes funded through low-income housing tax credits, and 16 homes with rental assistance through the housing authority's project-based voucher program. The 12 Section 8 rental assistance homes were preserved through RAD by transferring the rental assistance for these units from the Housing Authority's Short Court property, which will be redeveloped in the future.
The RAD transaction includes a construction budget of $19 million ($249,092 per unit) fully financed through:
National Housing Trust funds 9% Low-Income Housing Tax Credits Commercial First Mortgage Loan Tennessee Housing Development Agency funds
• National Housing Trust funds
• 9% Low-Income Housing Tax Credits
• Commercial First Mortgage Loan
• Tennessee Housing Development Agency funds
Cherokee Place is phase one of a two-phase development on a vacant site which was originally an 87-unit property built in 1971. The previous site was demolished due to its poor condition. Phase two, which will be known as Shawnee, and will be new construction of 50 units including 16 deeply affordable rental homes that will be converted to the Section 8 platform through RAD. When complete, this two-phase development will bring the total number of affordable homes on the site to 126.
The new units on this site will have central heat and air conditioning and energy efficient features. Additionally, the redevelopment will feature open and recreational space and will preserve the existing tree canopy near the development. Public transit is also available nearby.
About RAD RAD was designed to help address the multi-billion-dollar nationwide backlog of deferred maintenance in the public housing portfolio and to stem the loss of affordable housing that could no longer be kept to decent standards. From the program's inception through August 1, 2022, the RAD has facilitated more than $14.5 billion in capital investment to improve or replace nearly 180,000 deeply rent-assisted homes, most of which house extremely low-income families, seniors, and persons with disabilities.
Under RAD, projects funded under the public housing program convert their public housing assistance to project-based Section 8 rental assistance. Under Section 8, residents continue to pay 30% of their income towards rent and the housing must continue to serve those with very low and extremely low incomes, as was the case when the property was assisted through the public housing program. Residents must be notified and consulted prior to conversion, are given a right to return to assisted housing post-construction so that the same tenants can enjoy these newly preserved and improved apartments and maintain the same fundamental rights they had as public housing residents."
08/29/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-158.cfm,HUD Charges Kansas Housing Provider with Discriminating Against Applicant with Disabilities,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has charged Fox Run Apartments, LLC, the owner of an apartment complex in Shawnee, Kansas, and property manager Peterson Properties, Inc. with violating the Fair Housing Act by refusing to allow a prospective tenant, a veteran with a mental health disability, to live with his assistance animal. Read the Charge.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination because of disability. The Act makes it unlawful to refuse to grant reasonable accommodations for persons with disabilities, including failing to waive pet restrictions so that persons with disabilities can live with their assistance animals.
""Assistance animals provide people with disabilities, including our country's veterans, the support they need to enjoy the benefits of housing,"" said Demetria L. McCain, HUD Principal Assistant Deputy Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD is committed to taking appropriate action when housing providers fail to comply with the Fair Housing Act.""
HUD's Charge alleges that the property management company denied both the applicant's reasonable accommodation request to live with his assistance animal and his application for housing for his family. According to the Charge, the applicant had provided the necessary information to support his reasonable accommodation request through a letter from his psychiatrist at the Veterans Administration. Nevertheless, the management company denied the request and application after insisting, just before the applicant's move-in date, that the applicant's psychiatrist complete an additional, unnecessary form, which did not happen because the psychiatrist was on vacation. The applicant was then forced to seek housing elsewhere.
""The Fair Housing Act requires housing providers to make reasonable accommodations, including allowing individuals with disabilities to live with needed assistance animals,"" said Damon Smith, HUD General Counsel. ""As this Charge shows, housing providers may not claim to comply with this requirement but then make it unnecessarily difficult for individuals with disabilities to actually get the necessary accommodation.""
A United States Administrative Law Judge will hear HUD's Charge unless any party to the Charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds, after a hearing, that discrimination has occurred, the judge may award damages to the family for their losses because of the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief to deter further discrimination, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties to vindicate the public interest. If the federal court hears the case, the judge may also award punitive damages to the family.
People who believe they are the victims of housing discrimination should contact HUD at (800) 669-9777 (voice) 800-927-9275 (TTY). Additional information is available at www.hud.gov/fairhousing. Materials and assistance are available for persons with limited English proficiency. Individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing may contact the Department using the Federal Relay Service at (800) 877-8339."

The funding opportunity, made available through HUD's Older Adult Home Modification Program (OAHMP), will assist experienced nonprofit organizations, state and local governments, and public housing authorities in undertaking comprehensive programs that make safety and functional home modifications repairs and renovations to meet the needs of low-income elderly homeowners.
Secretary Fudge announced the funding opportunity while visiting a home modification project made possible by the OAHMP in Minneapolis, Minnesota. She was joined by U.S. Senator Tina Smith, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, Twin Cities Habitat for Humanity President and CEO Chris Coleman, and Betty and John Smith, the beneficiaries of the home modification project. While in Minnesota, Secretary Fudge is also visiting two properties to discuss housing supply and the Biden-Harris Administration's efforts to expand access to affordable housing.
""By 2040, it is estimated that 20 percent of the population will be over 65 years old,"" said Secretary Fudge. ""We must allow our nation's seniors to age-in-place with dignity. This funding will give seniors the flexibility to make changes to their existing homes -changes that will keep them safe and allow them to gracefully adjust to their changing lifestyle. This program is crucial to our work to increase and maintain our nation's housing supply, and it aligns with the Biden-Harris Administration's efforts to treat every person in this country with dignity and respect.""
""Everyone deserves to live happy, fulfilled lives in their own homes, including older adults and people living with disabilities. For far too long, we have underinvested in the simple help and support that people need so they can stay in their own homes. That's why I'm thrilled to announce $15 million in funding under the Older Adult Home Modification Program,"" said Senator Smith. ""This funding will help thousands of seniors and people living with disabilities nationwide to safely stay in their homes connected to the neighborhoods they know and love for longer.""
The goal of the home modification program is to enable low-income elderly persons to remain in their homes through low-cost, low barrier, high impact home modifications to reduce older adults' risk of falling, improve general safety, increase accessibility, and to improve their functional abilities in their home. This will enable older adults to remain in their homes, that is, to ""age in place,"" rather than move to nursing homes or other assisted care facilities.
The funding opportunity establishes a program model that incorporates two core concepts: first, as people age, their needs change, and they may need adaptations to their physical environment to live safely at home; second, for any intervention to have the highest impact, the individual's personal goals and needs must be a driver in determining the actual intervention.
Examples of these home modifications include installation of grab bars, railings, and lever-handled doorknobs and faucets, as well as the installation of adaptive equipment, such as temporary ramp, tub/shower transfer bench, handheld shower head, raised toilet seat, risers for chairs and sofas, and non-slip strips for tub/shower or stairs.
Read HUD's Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) here (www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=343305). Eligible applicants can apply for funds through Grants.gov.
Under the Biden Harris Administration and the leadership of Secretary Fudge, HUD has prioritized increasing and maintaining the nation's housing supply.
In May, President Biden released a comprehensive Housing Supply Action Plan (www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/16/president-biden-announces-new-actions-to-ease-the-burden-of-housing-costs/) outlining administrative and legislative actions that will lower housing prices, close the housing supply shortfall in five years, and create hundreds of thousands of affordable housing units in the next three years.
Building on the Administration's housing supply actions, on June 1, 2022, Secretary Fudge launched HUD's ""Our Way Home"" initiative to increase affordable housing supply in local communities with a National Day of Action on housing supply.
Additionally, the Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law by the President earlier this month, will allow owners of HUD-assisted multifamily properties to preserve tens of thousands of affordable rental homes by making them more efficient, healthier, and resilient."
08/31/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-160.cfm,"Owner and Property Manager of Florida RV Park Agree to Pay $45,000 to Resolve Claims of Housing Discrimination Against Transgender Woman","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has entered into a Consent Order with the owner of a Davenport, Florida RV park, 21 RV Palms Resort, Inc., and its property manager, Nathan Dykgraaf, to resolve allegations of gender identity discrimination under the Fair Housing Act. Read the consent order here.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from discriminating on the basis of sex, which includes prohibiting tenants from expressing their gender. HUD's Charge of Discrimination resulted from a complaint that the tenant, a transgender woman, filed with HUD. The Charge alleged that Dykgraaf violated the Act when he gave the tenant a letter stating that he was aware she was transitioning and telling her to act as a man, talk as a man, and dress as a man to avoid trouble.
""Housing providers have no place restricting a transgender resident's expression of their gender identity,"" said Demetria L. McCain, HUD's Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""And, as HUD's Charge and Consent Order make clear, HUD will vigorously enforce the Fair Housing Act to protect the rights of LGBTQIA+ individuals and ensure housing providers do not fail to meet their fair housing obligations.""
The Consent Order, approved by a HUD Administrative Law Judge, requires 21 RV Palms Resort and Dykgraaf to pay the tenant and her family $45,000 in damages. 21 RV Palms Resort and Dykgraaf are also barred from future discrimination and will undergo training on the Fair Housing Act, including training on transgender and gender non-conforming discrimination. The Consent Order does not constitute an admission of liability by 21 RV Palms Resort or Dykgraaf.
""Today's important settlement demonstrates HUD's continuing commitment to ensuring housing providers do not discriminate because of gender identity,"" said Damon Smith, HUD's General Counsel. ""HUD will take action to seek redress for victims of such discrimination.""
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 877-8339 (Relay). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to hud.gov/fairhousing."
09/01/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-161.cfm,HUD Publishes FY 2023 Fair Market Rents,"FMRs Will Make It Easier for Families with Housing Vouchers - Including Vouchers Created Under this Administration - to Use Their Vouchers to Access Affordable Housing
WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today published Fair Market Rents (FMRs) for Fiscal Year 2023. FMRs, published annually, are an estimate of the amount of money that would cover gross rents (rent and utility expenses) on 40 percent of the rental housing units in an area. Nationally, FMRs will increase by an average of approximately 10 percent, enabling more households with housing vouchers to access affordable, stable housing. For FY23, HUD is using private sector data to estimate changes in FMRs to address a temporary data availability challenge and to align with market conditions. The basic methodology that HUD uses to estimate FMRs remains the same.
""One of the reasons that housing voucher holders are unable to use those vouchers is because the value of their vouchers has not kept up with rapid rent increases,"" said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""These new FMRs will make it easier for voucher holders facing this challenge to access affordable housing in most housing markets, while expanding the range of housing opportunities available to households. The new FMRs reflect the reality of housing unaffordability for many households, while supporting our efforts to improve affordability and accessibility for all Americans. HUD and the Biden-Harris Administration recognize the burdens of housing costs and are committed to expanding access to affordable housing through a wide range of necessary efforts, from boosting housing supply to providing more vouchers to help households with higher housing costs.""
Because rents have risen so quickly recently, voucher holders are increasingly unable to find units available to rent within HUD payment standards. The new FMR levels announced today will enable the voucher program to keep up with rent increases in the private market. These new FMRs will allow voucher holders to access and secure leases in more units so that they can benefit from the housing affordability and stability that vouchers provide.
HUD is required by law to set FMRs every year. FMRs, which go into effect on October 1, are used in several HUD programs, including to determine the maximum amount that a Housing Choice Voucher will cover. Click here to view the FY23 FMRs (www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/fmr.html#2023). A fact sheet on the FY23 FMRs is available here.
Since taking office, the Biden-Harris Administration has repeatedly acted to help vulnerable renter households attain quality and stable housing. For example:
The American Rescue Plan and FY22 budget collectively provided nearly 100,000 new housing choice vouchers. This includes about 20,000 new flexible incremental housing choice vouchers that HUD expects to allocate in coming weeks via formula to most communities across the country. The President's FY23 budget proposes 200,000 additional housing vouchers. In June, HUD announced $43 million in FY21 funding to fund approximately 4,000 new incremental housing choice vouchers, or ""Stability Vouchers,"" focused on people experiencing unsheltered homelessness, including in rural areas. The American Rescue Plan also included $5 billion to create housing and services for people experiencing or at risk of homelessness, and provided tens-of-billions of dollars for Emergency Rental Assistance, which improved housing stability for over 6 million unique households, including 700,000 HUD-assisted households (www.huduser.gov/portal/pdredge/pdr-edge-trending-082322.html).

Due to significant interruptions in public data sources caused by COVID-19, HUD supplemented public data with data from private sources to ensure the accuracy of the FY23 FMRs. This methodological change - which incorporated public feedback through a notice of proposed changes (www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/07/13/2022-14913/proposed-changes-to-the-methodology-used-for-calculating-fair-market-rents) - is only applicable to FY23. Calculating the FY23 FMRs in this way ensures that FMRs accurately reflect recent, steep rent increases in many communities and will make it easier for households in those communities to use their vouchers to rent affordable homes."
09/06/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-162.cfm,HUD Announces $5.5 Million Funding Opportunity for HBCUs to Conduct Housing and Community Development Research,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced that it will make available $5.5 million for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to establish or bolster existing Centers of Excellence (COE) that conduct housing and community development research.
""Historically Black Colleges and Universities are economic anchors for their communities,"" said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""At HUD, we are proud to partner with HBCUs to develop strong communities, build affordable housing, create job opportunities, revitalize neighborhoods, and promote homeownership. The funding availability we've announced today will strengthen efforts by HBCUs to expand opportunities for underserved communities and promote equitable community development.""
The grants will be used to provide HBCUs with funding to conduct research on the topics of housing, community development, and economic development, particularly in underserved communities. Research projects will initiate an ongoing series of reports focused on housing, community, and economic development in underserved communities that can serve as national, local, or regional benchmarks and assist in support of COEs that expand the housing and community development research efforts at HBCUs.
The COE should take a multidisciplinary approach to housing and community development research, and through innovative methods study the social and economic factors that create healthy communities. Ultimately, the purpose of the COE should be to influence policy at the local, state, and national levels, providing evidence-based innovative approaches to community development based on research it undertakes. Through academic programs, research projects and thought leadership, the COE will help leaders across all levels of government as well as the business and civic sectors address critical issues that impact the social and economic well-being of the families and individuals who reside in underserved urban and rural communities.

WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) announced today that it is increasing the frequency of allowable distributions of surplus cash to borrowers with most FHA-insured Multifamily mortgages from two times per accounting year to up to monthly distributions for eligible borrowers. This change will free up capital more frequently for use by borrowers in future Multifamily development and will align FHA income distribution rules with those used in private industry.
""This much-needed change better aligns FHA-insured mortgage financing with other capital sources, helping to maintain FHA's products as competitive offerings to finance the rental housing that so many communities need,"" said Deputy Assistant Secretary for Multifamily Housing Programs Ethan Handelman.
Borrowers with FHA-insured Multifamily properties not subject to a Section 8 rental assistance payment contract or a HUD-held mortgage note may be eligible to increase the frequency of their surplus cash distributions. In addition, FHA has retained existing risk management conditions, including current payments and reporting requirements, while expanding other conditions and enforcement actions.

Read the VCA-CA here.
The Agreement stems from a complaint filed by the tenant alleging that DHA violated several civil rights laws when it failed to grant her reasonable request to move to a ground-floor unit after a car accident precluded her ability to climb the stairs to her second-floor apartment. The Agreement resolves HUD's Letter of Findings, which found that DHA discriminated against the tenant in violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), as well as the tenant's complaint of disability discrimination under the Fair Housing Act.
The Fair Housing Act, Section 504, and the ADA prohibit discrimination in housing because of disability. This includes refusing to provide reasonable accommodations for persons with disabilities when necessary to provide them an equal opportunity to use or enjoy a dwelling.
""Reasonable accommodations are essential to ensuring that individuals with disabilities have equal opportunity to enjoy and benefit from their housing,"" said Demetria L. McCain, HUD's Principal Deputy Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Public housing agencies are not exempt from fair housing laws. HUD is pleased the parties were able to resolve the matter and expects others with disabilities to be afforded reasonable accommodations as well.""
HUD found that DHA's failure to grant the tenant's reasonable accommodation request forced her to crawl up and down the stairs to access or leave her home, causing her physical pain, injury, and humiliation. HUD also found that DHA retaliated against the tenant after she requested a ground-floor unit by refusing to accept her rental payments and then evicting her. The tenant then became homeless. DHA denied any wrongdoing in the Agreement.
In addition to the $500,000 payment to the tenant, the Agreement requires DHA to take steps to vacate all judgments it obtained against her and clear any debts DHA had alleged she owed. In addition, DHA will pay a $10,528 civil penalty to HUD. DHA will also overhaul its reasonable accommodation policies and pre-eviction grievance hearing procedures to ensure compliance with the civil rights laws. It will also establish an effective communication policy that ensures individuals with disabilities can participate in all programs.

WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Office of HIV/AIDS Housing announced it will award $8,870,916 million in Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH) Renewal and Replacement Grants, which assist with tenant based rental assistance, supportive services, and other housing activities. This is the first of two rounds of grant announcements.
""Access to safe, stable, and affordable housing is a critical social determinant of health"", said HUD Secretary Marcia Fudge. ""I am proud of the role HUD will play to prevent discrimination against people living with HIV and AIDS, expand access to HIV housing and services, and, ultimately, reduce stigma.""
Research shows that a stable home is critical to the well-being of persons living with HIV/AIDS, and results in better health outcomes and reduced transmission of the disease. In addition to housing assistance, these local programs will provide access to supportive services such as case management, mental health services, substance abuse services, and employment training. The combination of housing assistance and supportive services are critical in sustaining housing stability, promoting better health outcomes, and increasing quality of life, which promotes self-sufficiency efforts for those able to transition to the private housing market.
Since 1992, HUD's HOPWA Program has provided national leadership and resources that support the development and operation of high-quality supportive housing programs. Under the HOPWA Program, HUD makes grants to cities, states, and nonprofit organizations to provide housing assistance and supportive services to low-income persons living with HIV/AIDS and their families. By providing assistance with housing and related services, the HOPWA program helps persons living with HIV/AIDS enter into housing, access and remain in medical care, and adhere to complex treatment regimens.

09/16/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-172.cfm,"HUD Releases Updated Public Housing Agency Disaster Readiness, Response, and Recovery Guidebook","HUD Deputy Secretary Todman Announces Release of Updated Guidebook During Visit to Mixed-Income Housing Site in Miami, FL: It's Critical that Public Housing Agencies Have the ""Resources and Tools to Take a Proactive Approach to Protect Their Properties and the Safety and Well-Being of Residents""
Release of Updated Guidebook Coincides with National Preparedness Month
WASHINGTON - Today, as part of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) efforts to support communities in disaster recovery and mitigation, and in recognition of National Preparedness Month (www.ready.gov/september), HUD released an updated version of its Public Housing Agency (PHA) Disaster Readiness, Response, and Recovery Guidebook to assist PHAs in effectively navigating the disaster process.
HUD Deputy Secretary Adrianne Todman announced the release of the updated guidebook while visiting the mixed-income River Parc housing site in Miami, Florida. While in Miami, Deputy Secretary Todman also participated in a fireside chat on resilience and inclusivity at the Smart City Expo USA and will address the U.S. Conference of Mayors on HUD's efforts to boost the affordable housing supply.
""Preparing for the impacts of disasters is more important now than ever,"" said Deputy Secretary Todman. ""Natural disasters, often exacerbated by climate change, are increasing in frequency and scope, with vulnerable communities bearing the brunt of the impact. It is important that families and communities are prepared. This month, National Preparedness Month, HUD is pleased to announce the publication of our updated Readiness, Response, and Recovery Guidebook created especially to aid lower income communities. It is critical that housing providers have the resources and tools to take a proactive approach to protect their properties and the safety and well-being of residents.""
The update to the guidebook directly supports HUD's Climate Action Plan, released last year as part of the Biden-Harris Administration's whole-of-government approach to confronting the climate crisis. This plan includes actions to strengthen disaster recovery by updating policies and operations to create greater climate resilience.
Since its first publication in 2016, the guidebook has new sections on funding strategies, financial management, communications, and short- and long-term housing options for displaced families have been added. To further the comprehensiveness of the document, the guidebook is divided into chapters on readiness, response, and recovery and includes available resources, best practices, lessons learned, and clear guidance on a PHA's roles and responsibilities.
""I have personally reviewed HUD's Public Housing Agency Disaster Readiness, Response, and Recovery Guidebook, and found that even with all the local South Florida disaster planning materials that we use, this guidebook fills in information gaps regarding federal departments and assistance, and issues specific to public housing authorities such as operating and capital funds, and housing choice voucher administrative plans addressing relocation needs. It's a practical guide and a job well done!"" said Michael Liu, Director, Miami-Dade County Department of Public Housing and Community Development.
With additional guidelines in place to take preemptive measures, PHAs can feel more confident in their ability to respond to a disaster. By remaining proactive in assessing their risks, establishing relationships with their local emergency management agencies, and tailoring plans that ensure the continuity of operations and includes a robust communications strategy, PHAs can ensure an inclusive and equitable recovery.

Two awardees, The Urban Institute and Horne, LLP, will receive the funds under the (FY2022) Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO).
""Disasters often result in a loss of naturally occurring affordable rental housing,"" said HUD's Policy Development and Research General Deputy Assistant Secretary Todd Richardson. ""These two organizations will help us better understand what long-term recovery looks like for low-income renters and the availability of affordable rental housing in communities impacted by disasters, with a goal toward seeing what efforts have been more successful than others.""
For Horne, LLP, the goal is to provide a deeper understanding of recovery outcomes of renter households in areas funded with Community Development Block Grant - Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) funds and what factors contribute toward different outcomes. The Urban Institute intends to utilize a unique set of data from the last decade to assess disaster outcomes on affordable rental housing in communities receiving CDBG-DR funds. Their research will include focus groups and structured interviews with housing developers, landlords, and renters at three case study sites.
CDBG-DR funds support long-term recovery after large disasters and are targeted toward the most heavily impacted and distressed areas. Providing funds for disaster research studies is extremely important to future policy recommendations and improvements to future recovery efforts."

09/20/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-175.cfm,"FACT SHEET: One-Year Anniversary of HUD's ""House America"" Initiative to Address Homelessness","September 20, 2022, marks one year since U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Marcia L. Fudge launched House America, a federal initiative to address the crisis of homelessness by leveraging the American Rescue Plan and other federal resources through a Housing First approach. Housing First is a proven model of addressing homelessness by quickly rehousing people experiencing homelessness and ensuring that they have access to permanent housing and supportive services. House America aims to re-house at least 100,000 households experiencing homelessness, and to add at least 20,000 new units of affordable housing into the development pipeline by December 31, 2022.
Since Secretary Fudge's announcement, communities within the initiative have issued nearly all of their Emergency Housing Vouchers, provided by the American Rescue Plan, to American households and have dedicated over $450 million in federal grants toward rehousing efforts. Tackling homelessness requires collaboration at all levels of government, and HUD will continue to work with its partners and provide assistance and expertise on deploying federal resources to maximize effect. Below are examples of the progress House America has made over the past year:
Participating Leaders
Elected leaders representing 103 communities have joined House America. These include 79 municipalities, 16 counties, one regional leadership council, one regional council of governments, four states, one U.S. territory, and one Tribal nation. Together, these jurisdictions represent over 54 percent of people experiencing homelessness in the U.S.
Rapid Rehousing
House America communities have issued nearly all of their 22,500 Emergency Housing Vouchers to households, getting crucial resources to people who need them. Of these, 10,000 households successfully leased up.
House America communities have dedicated at least $450 million in Emergency Solutions Grants - CARES Act (ESG-CV) funds towards re-housing activities (Rapid Rehousing).
Current data shows that together, House America communities have rehoused at least 62,000 households.
The new Fair Market Rents (FMRs) released by HUD in September will make it easier for more individuals and families with housing vouchers - including vouchers created under the Biden-Harris Administration - to use their vouchers to access affordable housing.
Affordable Housing Pipeline
Current data shows that together, House America communities have added at least 15,500 units of affordable and supportive housing into their development pipelines.
Resources and Support
HUD and the Biden-Harris Administration have provided robust resources and support to empower communities to meet the housing needs of people experiencing homelessness. Below are examples of resources and support provided specifically to House America communities:
Community-Wide Commitments: HUD has provided more than $1.25 billion through HUD's 2021 Continuum of Care (CoC) competition awards. The CoC program is designed to promote a community-wide commitment to the goal of ending homelessness. The program is the largest source of federal grant funding for homeless services and housing programs servicing people experiencing homelessness. Housing, Shelter, and Outreach: HUD has provided more than $1.3 billion through CARES ESG-CV for housing, shelter, and outreach services. Emergency Housing Vouchers: House America communities have collectively received 22,500 Emergency Housing Vouchers through the American Rescue Plan. Housing Development and Rental Assistance: HUD has provided more than $1.5 billion in HOME-ARP funds for housing development, rental assistance, or services through the American Rescue Plan. State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds: House America communities have collectively received more than $50 billion through the American Rescue Plan's State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds (Treasury) that communities can use to respond and recover from the pandemic, including housing development, rental assistance, or other housing services. HUD and Treasury are working together to assist recipients in implementing funds for affordable housing (https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0889). Virtual Convenings and Technical Assistance: HUD holds twice monthly virtual convenings of House America leaders to spotlight successes and share best practices. The department also provides tools and technical assistance to support House America communities in meeting their goals. Coordinating Health and Supportive Services: The Housing and Services Resource Center (HSRC) (https://acl.gov/HousingAndServices) was created by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and HUD to foster collaboration and partnerships between the organizations and systems that help people live successfully and stably in the community, such as those providing housing resources, homelessness services, health care and mental health services, independent living services, home and community-based services, supportive services, and more. The HSRC continues to provide technical assistance to states and communities, including those participating in House America. For example, an August 2022 webinar with approximately 1,600 participants highlighted the importance of partnerships between HUD Continuums of Care, the disability and aging networks, and health services providers in addressing the needs of people experiencing homelessness and provided examples of successful approaches from two states that could be adopted in other communities. Transit-Oriented Development: The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), in support of House America, issued a Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) for the 2022 Pilot Program for Transit-Oriented Development Planning (www.transit.dot.gov/TODPilot) that prioritizes planning grants in areas with high rates of homelessness.

Unsheltered and Rural Homelessness
House America communities can apply for resources through HUD's recently announced first-ever funding opportunity for coordinated approaches to address unsheltered homelessness, including resources for rural communities. The package provides $322 million, including a $54.5 million set-aside for rural communities, for permanent housing, supportive services, and other costs. It also provides $43 million to fund approximately 4,000 new incremental Housing Choice Vouchers. In August, HUD released its allocation strategy and program requirements for these new vouchers.

09/21/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-178.cfm,HUD Charges Minnesota Housing Provider with Disability Discrimination,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has charged Madison Property, LLC, the owner of an apartment complex in Winona, Minnesota, and landlord Andrew Brenner with violating the Fair Housing Act by refusing to allow a prospective tenant, a woman with a mental health disability, to live with her assistance animal. Read the Charge.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination because of disability. This includes refusing to grant reasonable accommodations for persons with disabilities, such as refusing to waive pet restrictions so that persons with disabilities can live with their assistance animals.
""Assistance animals provide people with disabilities the support they need to enjoy the benefits of their housing,"" said Demetria L. McCain, HUD's Principal Assistant Deputy Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD is committed to taking appropriate action when housing providers fail to comply with the Fair Housing Act.""
HUD's Charge alleges that the landlord denied the applicant's reasonable accommodation request to live with her assistance animal and rescinded the offer of a lease when her disability-related need was presented. According to the Charge, the applicant supported her reasonable accommodation request with a letter from her therapist. This letter provided all the information the landlord needed to approve her request, and the applicant even included information from HUD on the right to a reasonable accommodation. Nevertheless, the landlord refused to consider the request and told her to look elsewhere. He then told her he would return her security deposit and rescinded his lease offer. The applicant was then forced to seek another place to live under a tight time deadline.
""The Fair Housing Act requires housing providers to make reasonable accommodations to policies, including animal prohibitions, when such an accommodation is necessary for an individual with disabilities to have equal enjoyment of housing,"" said Damon Smith, HUD General Counsel. ""As this Charge shows, housing providers may not refuse to allow individuals with disabilities the aid that assistance animals can provide.""
A United States Administrative Law Judge will hear HUD's Charge unless any party to the Charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds, after a hearing, that discrimination has occurred, the judge may award damages to the applicant for her losses because of the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief to deter further discrimination, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties to vindicate the public interest. If the federal court hears the case, the judge may also award punitive damages to the applicant.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 877-8339 (Relay). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to hud.gov/fairhousing."

WASHINGTON - U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Marcia L. Fudge today announced the awarding of Choice Neighborhood Implementation (CNI) Grants totaling $180 million.
Secretary Fudge made the announcement in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where she presented a Choice Neighborhoods Implementation (CNI) Grant to the Tulsa Housing Authority and the City of Tulsa and HUD Deputy Secretary Adrianne Todman presented a CNI Grant to the City of Omaha and the Omaha Housing Authority. Each city received a program-high $50 million grant.
The Choice Neighborhoods Implementation Grants support communities that have undergone a comprehensive local planning process and are ready to implement their plan to redevelop the distressed public and/or assisted housing and neighborhood. The grants will help revitalize and transform neighborhoods across the country, while also providing residents with services focused on income, health, and education.
""Choice Neighborhoods awards are an investment in housing, people, and neighborhoods,"" said Secretary Fudge. ""They are a testament to the benefits of a community-driven, whole-of-government approach to neighborhood revitalization. This is the kind of investment that excites me as Secretary of HUD. It excites me because I know that this is what it will take to ensure that every one of our nation's communities can thrive. When we invest in housing, when we build up communities and ensure that residents have access to grocery stores, schools, and health care, we can make a real difference in people's lives.""
The CNI grants fund the creation of mixed-income housing communities, improve economic development opportunities, and support wide-scale community revitalization efforts that focus on the three areas of Housing, People and Neighborhood. The new grantees will join a committed group of 40 other Choice Neighborhoods sites nationwide that have collectively invested more than $5 billion into historically disinvested communities.
""Choice Neighborhoods awards are transformative tools that help breathe new life into communities,"" said Deputy Secretary Todman. ""Choice Neighborhoods investments allow communities to build housing, improve access to services and jobs, and to revitalize their areas in ways that can benefit residents of today and future residents, alike.""
Continuing the grantee visits, HUD Region 4 Administrator Jose Alvarez will make a trip to Knoxville, TN on Friday, September 23, where he will present a $40 million Choice Neighborhoods grant to the Knoxville Community Development Corporation and the City of Knoxville.
Finally, Durham, North Carolina will welcome HUD General Deputy Assistant Secretary Dominique Blom on Monday, September 26, to announce the $40 million that the Durham Housing Authority and City of Durham have been awarded.

With the new Housing Choice Vouchers HUD is announcing today, along with steps HUD is taking to make it easier for households to use vouchers, families across the country will have greater access to safe, stable, and affordable housing and the opportunities that come with it."" - HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge
Today, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Marcia L. Fudge will travel to Falls Church, Virginia to announce the awarding of more than 19,000 new Housing Choice Vouchers to almost 2,000 Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) across the country. This will be the most expansive allocation of flexible new rental assistance in 20 years.
Since taking office, the Biden-Harris Administration has repeatedly acted to help vulnerable renter households attain quality and stable housing through a historic expansion of the housing voucher program. The American Rescue Plan and Fiscal Year (FY) 2022 budget collectively provided nearly 100,000 new Housing Choice Vouchers, including the more than 19,000 vouchers being announced today. In June, HUD announced $43 million in FY21 funding to fund approximately 4,000 new incremental housing choice vouchers, or ""Stability Vouchers,"" focused on people experiencing unsheltered homelessness, including in rural areas. The American Rescue Plan also included $5 billion to create housing and services for people experiencing or at risk of homelessness, and provided tens-of-billions of dollars for Emergency Rental Assistance, which improved housing stability for over 6 million unique households, including 700,000 HUD-assisted households (www.huduser.gov/portal/pdredge/pdr-edge-trending-082322.html).
The Administration recognizes the importance of housing vouchers to securing affordable housing, and is fighting for an additional increase to the program. The President's Fiscal Year 2023 HUD Budget requests $1.6 billion for an additional 200,000 new housing vouchers.
HUD believes that every eligible household should have access to a voucher. Making market-rate housing that is affordable for lower-income families is an essential element of addressing the housing affordability crisis. HUD is committed to providing relief for renters: more vouchers available to families who need them and increased value of those vouchers to make more homes affordable. Today's announcement will help more people across the country access affordable housing, particularly people experiencing or at risk of homelessness.
Most Expansive Allocation of New Flexible Rental Assistance in 20 Years
Secretary Fudge is announcing new Housing Choice Vouchers to nearly every community in the country - from rural to suburban to urban, and from smaller communities to major metropolitan areas. Some communities will receive their first allocation of new vouchers in decades. Today's announcement includes:
More Than 19,000 New Housing Choice Vouchers to Nearly 2,000 Public Housing Agencies: HUD is awarding approximately 19,359 Housing Choice Vouchers to 1,945 PHAs across the country. The total award amount is $214,519,250. Funding for these vouchers was included in the FY 2022 appropriations act and was based on the President's FY 2022 budget request. A list of the awards is available here.
Making it Easier for Families to Access Affordable Housing with Vouchers
Over the past 18 months, 355,000 families have received and successfully used vouchers to rent homes at an affordable cost. But too many others were unable to use their vouchers, partly because the value of their vouchers had not kept up with rapid rent increases.
The 2023 Fair Market Rents (FMRs), which HUD published on September 1 and which go into effect on October 1, will make it easier for voucher holders to lease in most markets. The new FMR levels will enable the voucher program to keep up with rent increases in the private market. These new FMRs will allow voucher holders to access and secure leases in more units so that they can benefit from the housing affordability and stability that vouchers provide. HUD's action on FMRs will improve the utilization of both the baseline vouchers and the supplemental vouchers created under the Biden-Harris Administration.
Fighting for Additional New Housing Vouchers to Increase Affordable Housing Access for More Families
The Biden-Harris Administration has increased the size of the housing voucher program. In addition to the vouchers being awarded today, HUD awarded nearly 70,000 new Emergency Housing Vouchers (EHVs) through the American Rescue Plan for people at risk of or experiencing homelessness or fleeing domestic violence. More than 33,000 households are already using EHVs to rent affordable homes, and other 36,000 households with EHVs are actively searching for housing. The new HCVs will have similar flexibilities to the EHVs.
The President's Fiscal Year 2023 HUD Budget request for an additional 200,000 new housing vouchers is about 10 times the number of vouchers being awarded today. This would be the largest one-year increase in vouchers since the program was authorized in 1974 and would support affordable housing and provide greater access to areas of opportunity. The proposed vouchers prioritize survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, stalking, and human trafficking, and households experiencing homelessness."

The Agreement resolves allegations that a female tenant was subjected to sexual harassment by Parker and that the owners and manager failed to prevent further incidents of sexual harassment. This Conciliation Agreement does not constitute an admission by Respondents or evidence of a determination by HUD of any violation of the Fair Housing Act or any other law. Read the Conciliation Agreement here.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits sexual harassment of tenants and other forms of housing discrimination because of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, disability, and familial status.
""Tenants should not have to endure sexual harassment in their homes,"" said Demetria L. McCain, HUD's Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Today's conciliation agreement should send a clear message that HUD is committed to ensuring housing providers meet their obligations under the Fair Housing Act.""
The case came to HUD's attention when the tenant filed a complaint with HUD. Under the Agreement, Perris Family Apartments will pay the tenant $21,000 and take other actions to prevent sexual harassment, including providing training for employees. The respondents denied the allegations but voluntarily agreed to settle the matter.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 877-8339 (Relay). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to hud.gov/fairhousing."

WASHINGTON - U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Marcia L. Fudge traveled to Falls Church, Virginia today to announce the awarding of more than 19,000 new Housing Choice Vouchers (HCVs) to almost 2,000 Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) in nearly every community across the country. This is the most expansive allocation of flexible new rental assistance in 20 years. In some communities, this is the first allocation of new vouchers in decades.
""To help people who are dealing with the housing affordability crisis, including people experiencing homelessness, we are awarding more than 19,000 new Housing Choice Vouchers to housing agencies throughout the country,"" said Secretary Fudge. ""HUD is committed to ensuring people have access to the resources and tools they need to get a decent and safe home. That is what everyone in this country deserves. Every eligible household should have access to a voucher. No one should have to sleep on the street or in their car because they can't afford rent.""
The vouchers announced today are among the nearly 100,000 new HCVs provided by the American Rescue Plan and Fiscal Year 2022 budget. The total award amount is $214,519,250. Funding for these vouchers was included in the FY 2022 appropriations act and was based on the President's FY 2022 budget request. A list of the awards is available here.
During her visit to Falls Church, Secretary Fudge spoke with residents who previously secured affordable housing with HCVs about their experiences in the program and the importance of the new HCV awards and steps HUD is taking to make it easier for households to use their vouchers amid rising rents. Secretary Fudge was joined in Falls Church by Congressman Don Beyer and Fairfax County Redevelopment and Housing Authority Executive Director, Thomas Fleetwood.
The 2023 Fair Market Rents (FMRs), which HUD published on September 1 and which go into effect on October 1, will make it easier for families with housing vouchers - including the HCVs announced today and other vouchers created under the Biden-Harris Administration - to use their vouchers to access affordable housing. The new FMR levels will enable the voucher program to keep up with rent increases in the private market.
Since taking office, the Biden-Harris Administration has repeatedly acted to help vulnerable renter households attain quality and stable housing through a historic expansion of the housing voucher program. Today's allocation will help more people across the country access affordable housing, particularly people experiencing or at risk of homelessness.

WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today released a Request for Information (www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/09/27/2022-20855/green-and-resilient-retrofit-program-request-for-information) in public inspection form in the Federal Register to obtain public input regarding the development of its Green and Resilient Retrofit Program (GRRP). President Biden's Inflation Reduction Act provided $1 billion in funding to HUD's Office of Multifamily Housing Programs to implement the GRRP, as well as to support benchmarking of water and energy use in Multifamily assisted housing properties.
When implemented, the GRRP will provide grant and loan funding to facilitate retrofits of properties participating in its Multifamily assisted housing programs to make them more energy efficient, healthier, and resilient in the face of natural disasters and climate change. Eligible properties will include those participating in the Section 8 Project-based Rental Assistance, Section 202 Supportive Housing for Low-Income Elderly, and Section 811 Supportive Housing for Low-Income Persons with Disabilities programs.
""Implementing the GRRP will provide much-needed funding to reduce water and utility costs and keep the homes of the nation's low-income individuals and families safe in the face of climate change,"" said Assistant Secretary for Housing Julia Gordon. ""But GRRP also provides a means of addressing issues of housing equity and environmental justice and reducing these properties' climate impact.""
The water and energy use benchmarking component of the program will enable Multifamily property owners and HUD to better understand current water and energy usage to inform future policy and program development efforts.
Through the Request for Information, HUD seeks input on GRRP program design features, energy-saving measures, low-emission technology, and resilience design measures that have proven effective in affordable multifamily buildings. In addition, HUD is seeking input on the ways in which it can best implement and incentivize benchmarking of energy and water consumption of assisted multifamily properties.
""The unprecedented funding we have received for GRRP underscores the Biden-Harris Administration's deep commitment to addressing climate change and energy efficiency,"" said Deputy Assistant Secretary for Housing Ethan Handelman, ""it also reinforces our commitment to investing in high-quality, safe, resilient, and affordable rental housing for the approximately 1.4 million households of limited means who live in HUD Multifamily assisted housing properties."""

www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DkKAVz8D0A
WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) on September 27, 2022 announced the Asset Building cohort of the expansion of the Moving to Work (MTW) Demonstration Program. Through this cohort, HUD will evaluate asset building activities that encourage the creation and growth of savings accounts and/or aim to build credit, through rent reporting, for assisted households. HUD will first call a community of practice of the selected agencies to discuss and develop these policies for implementation and evaluation.
This cohort is a key component of HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge's economic justice agenda: Bridging the Wealth Gap. The agenda focuses on asset building through increased savings, access to mainstream banking, and credit score improvement. By integrating asset building, anti-poverty policies can more directly facilitate economic stability for millions of Americans.
""I am so excited to announce our newest cohort of PHAs in the Moving to Work Demonstration program,"" said Secretary Fudge. ""This cohort will create environments for low-income renters to better their credit scores, access bank accounts, and save for the future. And, most importantly, this cohort will have the flexibility to develop solutions that meet the needs of their unique communities.""
In April of 2022, HUD published PIH Notice 2022-11 seeking applications for the Asset Building Cohort of the MTW Expansion. The notice laid out the process by which PHAs with 6,000 or less combined units of public housing and HCV units would be selected for the Asset Building Cohort.
First authorized by Congress in 1996, MTW is a demonstration that provides public housing authorities (PHAs) the opportunity to redefine how they operate by giving them flexibility to try ""outside the box"" ideas that address local community needs in innovative ways. MTW allows PHAs the flexibility to create customized solutions to their community's specific challenges. With the addition of the 18 PHAs selected for this cohort, HUD will have added a total of 87 PHAs to the MTW Demonstration Program since January 2021. MTW PHAs are now in 40 states and the District of Columbia.
MTW encourages an entrepreneurial spirit to think of and create solutions in a new way. MTW agencies have directly influenced national policy for over 25 years, paving the way for the future delivery of federally assisted housing. PHAs in the MTW demonstration have pioneered several innovative policy interventions that have been successful at the local level, and subsequently rolled out to the rest of the country's PHAs. Examples include requiring less frequent recertifications for those on a fixed income, increasing payment standards for the reasonable accommodation of persons with disabilities, and allowing the owners to maintain site-based waiting lists for project-based vouchers.
MTW gives PHAs the freedom to design and test local strategies, to be innovative and creative when designing and implementing policies and programs; and to come up with solutions that meet the needs of the PHA, their community, and most importantly the families they serve. The following PHAs were selected for the Asset Building cohort:"

WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) is announcing today that it will begin to permit inclusion of a first-time homebuyer's positive rental payment history as an additional factor in the credit assessment performed in the Technology Open to Approved Lenders (TOTAL) Mortgage Scorecard to determine eligibility for an FHA-insured mortgage. By adding a positive rental history indicator to the Scorecard, FHA's credit evaluation will become more comprehensive and equitable, with the goal of enabling additional first-time homebuyers to qualify for affordable FHA-insured mortgage financing.
""If you're regularly paying your rent on time, that's a good indication you will also pay your mortgage on time,"" said Federal Housing Commissioner Julia Gordon. ""We hope that adding this positive factor to all of the characteristics currently considered in an FHA credit evaluation will increase access to affordable FHA-insured mortgages for first-time homebuyers.""
In its new policy, FHA considers positive rental payment history as the on-time payment of all rental payments in the previous 12 months. To utilize this added factor for their borrowers, lenders originating forward purchase mortgages for FHA insurance will be required to obtain verification of the borrower's on time rental payments and indicate via a new indicator within the Scorecard the submission of a positive rental payment history for the borrower.
""This change makes FHA requirements more flexible and can help remove barriers to homeownership, particularly for those with non-traditional credit or thin credit files,"" said Deputy Assistant Secretary for Single Family Housing Julienne Joseph.
Lenders may begin indicating a borrower's positive rental payment history in the TOTAL Mortgage Scorecard for scoring events on or after October 30, 2022, and for case numbers assigned on or after September 20, 2021.
The TOTAL Mortgage Scorecard is a statistically derived algorithm used to evaluate borrower credit history and mortgage application information. The Scorecard is accessed by lenders through most of the widely used industry Automated Underwriting Systems."

WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), in partnership with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, today awarded $5 million in $1 million allotments to five non-profits in support of the Veterans Housing Rehabilitation and Modification Pilot Program (VHRMP). The awardees of the competitive grants were selected by HUD's Office of Rural Housing and Economic Development (ORHED).
""There is no one more deserving of safe, accommodating housing than those who have served and defended this country,"" said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""These funds will help our low-income, disabled veterans achieve a dignified quality of life that allows them to live independently and comfortably.""
""All of our nation's Veterans deserve homes that help them live independent, comfortable, and fulfilling lives—especially those who live with low income or disabilities,"" said Secretary of Veterans Affairs Denis McDonough. ""This funding will help make that goal a reality for more than 300 Veterans by covering costs for much-needed home repairs, adaptive housing, and utilities. We are proud to partner with HUD and several non-profits in this important effort.""
Many of America's veterans who are low-income or disabled need adaptive housing to help them achieve or maintain their independence. The funds necessary for significant home repairs and high utility costs are often a barrier to veterans in fully realizing their freedom. HUD designed the VHRMP to alleviate these barriers.
Below are the five awardees:

New Home Sales
Sales of new single-family houses in August 2022 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 685,000, according to estimates released jointly by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. This is 28.8 percent (±18.3 percent)* below the revised July rate of 532,000 and is 0.1 percent (±16.5 percent)* below the August 2021 estimate of 686,000.
Sales Price
The median sales price of new houses sold in August 2022 was $436,800. The average sales price was $521,800.
For Sale Inventory and Months' Supply
The seasonally-adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of July was 461,000. This represents a supply of 8.1 months at the current sales rate.
Read more about new residential sales activity (www.census.gov/construction/nrs/index.html).
EXPLANATORY NOTES
These statistics are estimated from sample surveys. They are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated average relative standard errors of the preliminary data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. Changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show irregular movement. It takes 4 months to establish a trend for new houses sold. Preliminary new home sales figures are subject to revision due to the survey methodology and definitions used. The survey is primarily based on a sample of houses selected from building permits. Since a ""sale"" is defined as a deposit taken or sales agreement signed, this can occur prior to a permit being issued. An estimate of these prior sales is included in the sales figure. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimate of total sales is revised about 5.8 percent. Changes in sales price data reflect changes in the distribution of houses by region, size, etc., as well as changes in the prices of houses with identical characteristics. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau's website (www.census.gov/construction/nrs/how_the_data_are_collected/index.html).
* The 90 percent confidence interval includes zero. In such cases, there is insufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero."

Every two years, HUD and the Census Bureau produce the American Housing Survey (AHS), the most comprehensive analysis of the nation's housing inventory. The AHS covers a variety of important housing topics, including the composition and quality of the nation's housing stock; rents, mortgages and other housing costs; and neighborhood conditions. The AHS is used by the public, policymakers and professionals in many fields for research, planning, and decision making, as well as to understand the current state of our nation's housing markets and how they have changed over time. Today's release includes a Table Creator, which can be used to create custom tables by geographic area, demographics, income, and other characteristics (www.census.gov/programs-surveys/ahs/data/interactive/ahstablecreator.html) and the Public Use File, which contains household-level survey responses (www.census.gov/programs-surveys/ahs/data/2021/ahs-2021-public-use-file--puf-.html). These data are available in the Table Creator and Public Use File for the nation and for 25 large metropolitan areas, including the 15 largest metropolitan areas. The Table Creator also includes estimates for nine states.
The American Housing Survey (AHS) is the largest regular national housing sample survey in the U.S. and tracks housing units over time. This can provide us insights on how homes age and how the occupants of homes change. The 2021 American Housing Survey results released today provide new insights on how our relationship with our homes changed during the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns of 2020 and 2021 when compared to the data from before the pandemic.
Since the 2019 AHS survey was conducted, homeowners saw sharp increases in home values and were able to borrow at low interest rates. Renters, in contrast, experienced significant cost increases, such that the median renter now pays nearly the same as the median owner in total housing costs; however, owners have many more square feet per person, 800 square feet compared to 500 for renters. Homeowners were also able to move to a better home on average when they moved, while renters were just as likely to move to a better home as a worse home. Lower income households that moved had lower rates of moving to higher quality neighborhoods and housing units.*
Other highlights include:
Self-reported homeowner home values increased dramatically between 2019 and 2021; homeowners increased their mortgage debt modestly; and there was a sharp increase in refinancing. Homeowner reported median home values increased 30 percent at the national level in the two-year period, from $230,000 in 2019 to $300,000 in 2021. Among households with at least one mortgage or loan, the national median total amount owed increased 11 percent from $134,695 in 2019 to $150,000 in 2021. There was an increase in households that had a refinanced primary mortgage of 51 percent (from 12,574,008 refinances in 2019 to 18,991,554 in 2021). The median owners interest rate on their loan declined from 4% in 2019 to 3.5% in 2021.
Median housing costs for renters rose more than owners; the median renter now pays nearly the same as the median owner for total housing costs. Between 2019 and 2021, national median monthly total housing costs increased from $1,137 to $1,200 for owners, 5.5 percent over two years, and from $1,071 to $1,184 for renters (excludes renters with no cash rent), 10.6 percent over two years.
Inability to pay rent payments similar in 2021 to pre-pandemic; mortgage payment was better. The data show that in 2021 relative to 2017, renter inability to pay their rent was similar in the two years, about 7 percent, likely due to the CARES Act and other interventions, including federal unemployment insurance benefits and foreclosure and eviction moratoriums. In 2021, roughly 800,000 renters reported being threatened with an eviction. Of those, about 21 percent received a court ordered eviction notice. In 2021, the percentage of owners who missed or made late payments on their mortgage was less in 2021 than in 2017 (2.5 percent in 2021 compared to 4 percent in 2017).
Home renovations modestly increased during the pandemic. There was a modest increase in homeowners making home improvements between 2019 and 2021 (59 percent) relative to 2017 to 2019 (56 percent); 13.5 million homeowners made energy efficient improvements between 2019 and 2021, also an increase relative to the 12 million homeowners who made energy efficiency improvements between 2017 and 2019.
The internet continues to increase as the primary way people are finding rental units. Between 2019 and 2021, 21 million households moved into rental units and 14 million households moved into owned units. The internet was more widely used to find a unit to rent (43%) in 2021 than in 2019 (37%). Many renters (45%) only searched in a single neighborhood.
Among households that moved, most did not move to a better neighborhood; quality of homes was better for owners that moved but mixed for renters. Just 40% of recent mover households reported moving to a better neighborhood than their previous neighborhood. The majority of owners who moved reported moving to a better home (62%), but only half of renters improved their housing quality (46%). Lower income households that moved had lower rates of moving to higher quality neighborhoods and housing units.
Among all households in 2021, relatively few reported crime as a problem in their neighborhoods; but only a minority of households report having good public transit access. About 17% of households believe that their neighborhood has petty crime and about 6% believe that their neighborhood has a lot of serious crime. Around 42% of households believe that their neighborhood has good bus, subway, or commuter bus service.
Pet ownership rose modestly from 2017 to 2021; having a cell phone in the home is nearly universal. Approximately 63.8 million households in the U.S. owned at least one pet in 2021, a 7 percent increase from 2017. Pet ownership among homeowner is about 20% higher than among renters. Nearly all homes - 93 percent - have one or more household member with a cell phone in 2021, up from 91 percent in 2019.
A large majority of homes in Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) zones are not well distanced from wildland vegetation; a majority depend on text messaging for wildfire emergencies. The last decade has seen an increase in large wildfires that have led to the destruction of many housing units. The 2021 data show that approximately 37 million homes are in Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) zones. Of these, approximately 77% were in or near wildland vegetation, and 55% reported that they had vegetation less than 5 feet away from their home. Over 52% of households in WUI zones reported that they would expect to be alerted first through their cell phone (emergency alert, text, or call) during a wildfire emergency.

09/30/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-193.cfm,HUD Announces Section 202 Project Rental Assistance Renewal Contract Term Increases,"New, five-year rental assistance renewal contract terms reduce administrative barriers within program supporting housing for low-income seniors.
WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Office of Multifamily Housing Programs announced its intent to begin issuing Section 202 Project Rental Assistance Contracts (PRACs) with renewal terms of up to five years rather than the one-year terms that have previously been authorized. This administrative streamlining will reduce contract renewal and other administrative work for both owners of properties participating in the Section 202 Supportive Housing for Low-Income Elderly program and HUD.
""Our aim is to help housing providers focus more on providing affordable homes and supportive services to residents and less on administrative efforts to maintain funding streams,"" said HUD Office of Multifamily Housing Deputy Assistant Secretary Ethan Handelman. ""We are pleased that Congressional action has allowed us to streamline this important program.""
Execution of the new five-year contracts will be phased in as contracts become due for renewal over a three-year period between 2023 and 2025.
About the Section 202 Project Rental Assistance Program
Section 202 grants provide very low-income elderly persons 62 years of age or older with the opportunity to live independently in an environment that provides support services, such as nutritional, transportation, continuing education, and/or health-related services, to meet their unique needs. Section 202 program eligibility requires residents to be very low-income or earning less than 50 percent of the area median income."

10/03/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-199.cfm,HUD Charges California High-Rise Condominium Operators with Disability Discrimination,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is charging Aqua 388 Community Association, FirstService Residential California, LLC and two of its employees, and AQUA Maintenance Corporation, operators of a 556-unit, high-rise condominium tower located in Long Beach, with discriminating against a homeowner because of disability by refusing to provide her a permanent parking space to accommodate her wheelchair-accessible van. Read HUD's Charge.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination because of disability, including refusing to allow reasonable accommodations that would otherwise permit homeowners with disabilities an equal opportunity to use and enjoy their housing. A reasonable accommodation includes providing an accessible parking space.
""It is unacceptable that residents, such as this homeowner, are denied equal use and enjoyment of their homes because of the use of a wheelchair,"" said Demetria L. McCain, HUD Principal Assistant Deputy Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD is steadfast in ensuring that people with disabilities have accessible parking, in accordance with the Fair Housing Act.""
""Today's action should remind housing providers that they must provide accessible parking spaces so all residents can access and use the parking options available to them,"" said HUD General Counsel Damon Smith. ""HUD is committed to vigorously enforcing the Act to protect the rights of individuals with disabilities.""
HUD's Charge of Discrimination alleges that the property's operators denied the homeowner's multiple requests to provide her with a permanent van accessible parking space. The homeowner depends on a wheelchair for mobility, and her modified van requires an eight-foot clearance on the passenger side so that a ramp can extend. The Charge alleges further that because the homeowner's designated parking space does not have the necessary clearance for her van's ramp to extend, she has routinely been forced to scour her building's parking garage in search of a space that has sufficient passenger-side clearance.
A United States Administrative Law Judge will hear HUD's Charge unless any party to the Charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds, after a hearing, that discrimination has occurred, the judge may award damages to the homeowner for her losses as a result of the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, to deter further discrimination, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties to vindicate the public interest. If the federal court hears the case, the judge may also award punitive damages to the homeowner.
People who believe they are the victims of housing discrimination should contact HUD at (800) 669-9777 (voice) 800-927-9275 (TTY). Additional information is available at www.hud.gov/fairhousing.

WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) is announcing today the publication of a Request for Information (www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/10/04/2022-21047/request-for-information-regarding-small-mortgage-lending) (RFI) in the Federal Register seeking input on ways it can facilitate increased access to smaller balance mortgages through its Single Family mortgage insurance programs. Today's RFI will assist FHA as it explores opportunities to offer safe and sustainable mortgage credit to aspiring homeowners who live where houses may be less expensive.
""The input we receive through this RFI will help us better understand how FHA can make small mortgages more broadly available and affordable for those who need them,"" said Federal Housing Commissioner Julia Gordon. ""The RFI responses will help drive our programmatic work to increase access to homeownership and to close the racial homeownership gap.""
Specifically, the RFI asks questions concerning the current availability of small mortgage financing, barriers and disincentives to small mortgage lending transactions, changes to policies or processes that would encourage origination of more FHA-insured small balance mortgages, and considerations regarding liquidity provided through securitization.
Instructions for submitting comments, which are requested by December 5, 2022, can be found in the RFI."
10/04/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-201.cfm,HUD Releases Report Assessing Limited Supply of Small Mortgage Lending and Its Impact on Affordable Homeownership,"Research Reveals Policy Implications for FHA Actions Regarding Small Dollar Mortgages
WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today released a report that assesses the factors that limit the supply of small mortgage loans and the impact to affordable homeownership for those interested in lower-priced homes.
""This research supports the Biden-Harris Administration's efforts to advance equity and affordable homeownership by assessing barriers to small mortgages,"" said Solomon Greene, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research at HUD. ""By continuing to examine ways in which we can better support small-mortgage lending, we can take important steps to ensure equal access to credit for borrowers seeking to purchase lower-priced homes, putting the dream of homeownership within reach for many more families.""
The report, titled ""Financing Lower-Priced Homes: Small Mortgage Loans (www.huduser.gov/portal/portal/sites/default/files/pdf/Financing-Lower-Priced-Homes-Small-Mortgage-Loans.pdf)"", was submitted in response to a request from Congress to (1) ""identify barriers or impediments to supporting, facilitating, and making available mortgage insurance for mortgage loans having an original principal obligation of $70,000 or less, (2) identify administrative actions that HUD could take to remove barriers and impediments, and (3) describe the effect of such actions on the solvency of the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMI Fund).""
The report highlights challenges facing borrowers who need loans to purchase lower-priced homes. Among its principal findings, the report notes:
Mortgage loans with an original principal obligation of $70,000 or less are a small portion of the mortgage lending market, constituting less than 3.5 percent of home purchase originations in 2020. Many of these low balance mortgage loans secure properties valued at more than $70,000, indicating that the purchases included substantial down payments. Future reviews many want to focus on a different cut-off point. Federal Housing Administration (FHA) programs do not impose minimum loan amounts, nor do FHA's policies intentionally discriminate against small mortgage loans. FHA disproportionately insures loans for lower-priced homes compared to the rest of the mortgage market. FHA also has loan insurance programs for financing property improvements and manufactured homes that are particularly targeted to lower loan amounts. A significant barrier to small mortgage lending are fixed costs of loan origination and servicing, which makes smaller loans less profitable and may require additional incentivization for lenders.

WASHINGTON - U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Marcia L. Fudge and Deputy Secretary Adrianne Todman today participated in the second annual Freedman's Bank Forum held by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, which featured Vice President Kamala Harris. Secretary Fudge delivered remarks while Deputy Secretary Todman led a roundtable discussion on asset building in underserved communities.
During her remarks, Secretary Fudge announced new a new step HUD's Federal Housing Administration (FHA) is taking to explore increasing the availability of small balance mortgages, with the aim of better supporting and expanding affordable homeownership opportunities in underserved markets with lower housing prices. Secretary Fudge also announced the release of a new HUD report that assesses the factors that limit the supply of small mortgages and the impact to affordable homeownership for those interested in lower-priced homes.
""I am pleased to announce that HUD is soliciting specific and actionable feedback on the availability of small balance mortgages,"" said Secretary Fudge. ""We want to know what barriers prevent financial institutions from originating these loans. We want the banking industry's recommendations for how we can increase the volume of small mortgage loans in FHA programs. We know that people who live in less expensive or rural areas often find it hard to get a mortgage for a lower-priced home. In fact, today we released a report assessing the limited supply of small mortgages and the impact that has on affordable homeownership. It is my hope that this report, and public feedback, will help us identify steps we can take to turn the tide.""
To facilitate greater availability of small-balance mortgages, HUD's RFI will solicit specific and actionable feedback on the barriers that prevent the origination of these mortgages and recommendations for increasing the volume of small-mortgage loans in FHA programs. The RFI supplements HUD's new report to Congress, Financing Lower-Priced Homes: Small Mortgage Loans, which brings light to the challenges facing homeowners seeking smaller loans. By better understanding these challenges, policymakers can identify tools to increase the availability of such loans.
Deputy Secretary Todman co-hosted her roundtable, ""Asset Building in Underinvested Communities,"" with Marla Bilonick, President and CEO of the National Association for Latino Community Asset Builders (NALCAB). Other roundtable topics included addressing lender capacities, financing diverse housing suppliers, financing an equitable climate transition, and the Inflation Reduction Act.
This year's Freedman's Bank Forum highlighted the Biden-Harris administration's efforts to increase economic opportunity and growth for communities of color and address the persistent drivers of the racial wealth divide. The forum is named for the original Freedman's Savings and Trust Company, which was established in 1865 to provide newly emancipated Black Americans with the financial mechanisms to safeguard their earnings, build financial security, and generate family wealth."
10/04/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-203.cfm,HUD Charges Dallas-Area Housing Providers for Failing to Accommodate Individuals with Disabilities,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is charging Brockbk JV LLC, Dallas Redevelopment Equities LLC, Alden Short, Inc., and Sam Matalone, owners and operators of single-family rental homes in the Dallas metropolitan area, with discriminating against tenants with disabilities. Specifically, HUD alleges that the housing providers refused to modify the monthly payment date and waive late fees for two tenants who use Social Security Disability Income to pay their rent. Read the Charge.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination because of disability. This form of discrimination includes refusing to waive policies as a reasonable accommodation for tenants with disabilities, so they have an equal opportunity to use and enjoy their housing. A reasonable accommodation may include modifying the rent due date and waiving late fees for individuals receiving disability-based Social Security benefits.
HUD's Charge of Discrimination alleges that the tenants receive their Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) payments on or about the second day of the month, making it impossible for them to use that payment to pay rent on the first of the month, as the housing provider generally requires. Although for seven years the tenants' prior property manager had permitted them to pay their rent before the fifth day of the month, the new property manager refused to continue the accommodation and charged the tenants late fees. The new property manager issued the tenants notices terminating their tenancy, after they repeatedly asked that the accommodation be reinstated, indicated they would file a fair housing complaint and ultimately filed a complaint.
""Housing providers must provide necessary modifications in policies so that tenants with disabilities can have an equal opportunity to use and enjoy their home,"" said Demetria L. McCain, HUD Principal Assistant Deputy Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Today's Charge demonstrates HUD's ongoing commitment to take appropriate action when housing providers fail to comply with the Fair Housing Act.""
""The Fair Housing Act requires housing providers to provide accommodations that are reasonable and necessary, which may include making changes in rental payment due dates for tenants who receive Social Security Disability Income,"" said HUD General Counsel Damon Smith. ""HUD is committed to vigorously enforcing the Act to protect the rights of individuals with disabilities.""
A United States Administrative Law Judge will hear HUD's Charge unless any party to the Charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds, after a hearing, that discrimination has occurred, the judge may award damages to the tenants for their losses as a result of the discrimination.

10/04/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-204.cfm,HUD Awards Nearly $10.4 Million to Public Housing Agencies for Safety and Security Needs,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today awarded nearly $10.4 million to Public Housing Agencies (PHA) to make needed capital improvements in public housing developments that serve to enhance safety and security for residents.
""Safety in public housing is a top priority at HUD,"" said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""These funds will help identify and address opportunities to invest in physical improvements and to advance the health and safety of public housing residents.""
The funds are awarded through HUD's Capital Fund Emergency Safety and Security Program, which supports public housing authorities as they address the safety of public housing residents. These grants may be used to install, repair, or replace capital equipment or systems that contribute to a safer living environment for residents, including security systems/surveillance cameras, fencing, lighting systems, emergency alarm systems, window bars, deadbolt locks, doors, and carbon monoxide detectors.
With these set-aside funds, Congress may appropriate specific funding for safety and security, including measures necessary to address crime and drug-related activity. The HUD Department of Public and Indian Housing (PIH) can further elect to include costs related to the purchase, repair, replacement, and installation of carbon monoxide detectors as eligible activities. This is a proactive approach to eliminate the possibility of carbon monoxide in public housing developments.
These funds also support the Biden-Harris administration's Comprehensive Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Gun Crime and Ensure Public Safety (www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/23/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-comprehensive-strategy-to-prevent-and-respond-to-gun-crime-and-ensure-public-safety/). This strategy is highly preventative by implementing proven measures to reducing violent crime and attacking its root causes. This includes stemming the flow of firearms used to commit crimes, invest in evidence-based community violence interventions, and support local law enforcement with federal tools and resources.

10/05/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-205.cfm,HUD Announces Waivers to Help Florida Communities Recover from Hurricane Ian,"Announcement Represents One of the Largest Collections of Regulatory and Administrative Waivers Issued by HUD at One Time
Secretary Fudge: Waivers ""Build on HUD's Continued Post-Disaster Efforts and Unprecedented Aid from the Biden-Harris Administration""
WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced a package of 29 regulatory and administrative waivers aimed at helping communities in Florida accelerate their recovery from Hurricane Ian. Today's announcement represents one of the largest collections of regulatory and administrative waivers ever issued by the Department at one time, and builds on other support HUD is providing in the wake of the storm.
""Hurricane Ian caused substantial damage to Florida communities and displaced many individuals and families from their homes,"" said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""The waivers we are announcing today build on HUD's continued post-disaster efforts and unprecedented aid from the Biden-Harris Administration, giving our state and local partners the flexibility they need to more expeditiously recover and rebuild from the storm. We will continue to do everything in its power to ensure that our response to the devastation of Hurricane Ian meets the magnitude of the crisis.""
The regulatory and administrative relief announced today covers the following HUD programs: Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), HOME Investment Partnerships (HOME), Housing Trust Fund (HTF), Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA), Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG), and Continuum of Care (CoC). To expedite the use of these funds, HUD's state and local partners can now access a waiver through a new simplified notification process. HUD's flexibilities include:
Hurricane Ian disrupted communications networks. Therefore, HUD is waiving the normal communication requirements and allowing grantees to determine what constitutes reasonable notice and opportunity to comment. Hurricane Ian caused extensive damage and destruction to the housing stock in certain impacted areas. To accelerate new housing construction, HUD is suspending normal rules to enable CDBG grantees to replace affordable housing units that were lost as a result of severe weather. HUD recognizes that affected citizens may require additional time and effort to execute their recovery plans. Consequently, HUD will suspend a cap limiting CDBG expenditures for public services to 15 percent. HUD will temporarily allow CDBG grantees to pay for additional support services for individuals and families affected by Hurricane Ian. Services could include, but not be limited to, the provision of food, emergency shelter, case management, and related services to help residents in declared-disaster areas until long-term recovery resources become available.

HUD's support for Florida communities extends beyond the package of waivers announced today. On September 30, following President Biden's major disaster declaration (www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/09/29/president-joseph-r-biden-jr-approves-florida-disaster-declaration/), HUD announced the implementation of federal disaster relief for the state of Florida to assist state, tribal, and local recovery efforts for areas affected by Hurricane Ian beginning on September 23, 2022, and continuing. This relief included making mortgage insurance available, providing flexibility to Public Housing Agencies and assisting with housing discrimination.
Additionally, the HUD team will continue its outreach and coordination efforts with our public and private housing partners to offer support in navigating recovery and ensure the safety of residents and a fair and equitable recovery for all of the families served.
HUD plays a critical role in delivering support to communities with major disaster declaration status. After these disasters, local HUD leadership works with elected officials to check-in and offer general support in their time of need. HUD will identify points of alignment between issues raised and available HUD resources.
HUD also coordinates with federal inter-agency partners on local needs."

10/06/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-208.cfm,HUD Announces $5 Million Funding Opportunity to Support Housing and Infrastructure Investments in Disadvantaged Communities,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced the availability of $5 million through the Thriving Communities Technical Assistance program. The Thriving Communities program will help strengthen local capacity to align transformational infrastructure projects funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law with other crucial investments, such as affordable housing.
""Affordable housing investments must go hand-in-hand with transportation improvements. Connecting housing and transportation through transit-oriented development improves housing affordability, reduces automobile dependence, and expands access to employment, schools, health care, and other critical needs and opportunities for residents,"" said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""I am pleased to partner with Secretary Buttigieg and the Department of Transportation on the Thriving Communities program to better integrate housing and transportation planning to improve outcomes for America's underserved communities.""
Through this $5 million Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO), HUD will fund technical assistance providers to work with jurisdictions across the country to consider housing needs and boost supply as part of their larger infrastructure investment plans. Once technical assistance providers are selected, HUD will begin the process for qualifying local governments to come forward and request assistance.
HUD is seeking awardees that will take a localized, holistic approach to technical assistance, working across sectors and building local capacity. HUD expects technical assistance providers to have experience partnering with local organizations to satisfy specific technical assistance assignments, improving local capacity to plan for and execute capital projects, and supporting equitable engagement and outcomes.
While other federal agencies, such as the U.S. Department of Transportation and Environmental Protection Agency, are also providing technical assistance under the banner of Thriving Communities, HUD's technical assistance is specifically focused on integrating housing and transportation planning.
""No one understands a community's needs better than those who live there,"" said U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. ""This program will help equip more local leaders with the resources, knowledge, and assistance they need to access federal funding, and modernize their infrastructure so that it serves the community well for decades to come.""
Applications for HUD's Thriving Communities Technical Assistance NOFO are due by 11:59:59 PM EST on November 22, 2022. Search Grants (www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=343955) for additional information, including eligibility requirements, and to apply. HUD and DOT will host a webinar for interested applicants to learn more about the Thriving Communities program and specific requirements of each of the NOFOs.

10/06/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-209.cfm,HUD Makes Available Unprecedented $379 Million in Choice Neighborhoods Funding,"HUD's Signature Place-Based Program Available to Cities of All Sizes
WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced the availability of an historically-high $379 million in Choice Neighborhoods Implementation (CNI) Grants to communities across the country. The CNI Grants will transform public and other HUD-assisted housing, as well as surrounding neighborhoods. Public housing authorities, local governments, and/or tribal entities are eligible and encouraged to apply. The Fiscal Year 2022 funding is the highest amount of funding since the program's launch in 2010 and $150 million higher than the FY21 budget.
""This is an historic day for the Choice Neighborhoods program,"" said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""We are gaining the momentum we need to make big, impactful changes to the communities that need it the most. The most unique aspect of the program is that it's based on locally driven planning and investment, so that communities can truly own their transformations.""
CNI Grants aim to assist in the redevelopment of severely distressed HUD properties into a mixed-income community. The program has a three-pronged ""Housing, People, and Neighborhood"" approach that includes not only the redevelopment of distressed properties, but also supports outcomes related to the health, education, and income of the residents while simultaneously investing in economic development and neighborhood improvement projects. This comprehensive approach means that grantees must be able to leverage the funds they receive from HUD with other public and private resources.
Since the program's inception, the Choice Neighborhoods program has seen 10,000 new mixed-income units built across 44 cities. More than 32,000 units are planned. HUD has awarded more than $1.3 billion in Implementation Grant funds to date, with grantees achieving incredible results. For example, Louisville, Kentucky is using its grant to build 620 new, mixed-income housing units in the Russell neighborhood and perform much needed repairs on area housing. The city also saw new retail and quality childcare services come into the neighborhood. Additionally, Norwalk, Connecticut, which was devastated by Superstorm Sandy in 2012, used their Choice Neighborhoods Implementation Grant to develop 273 housing units and completed a major cleanup on an adjacent ""Brownfields"" site that was converted into a beautiful neighborhood park.
Overall, the Choice Neighborhoods program has led to new businesses, parks, and grocery stores, while resident incomes are increasing across most cities, in some cases doubling. A recent study conducted by Case Western Reserve University on the Chicago Choice Neighborhood showed HUD's investment generated $400 million in public and private resources. In addition, the study found median household incomes increased, crime rates fell steadily, and home ownership rates increased.
HUD recently announced a total of $180 million in Choice Neighborhoods Implementation Grants in Fiscal Year 2021 funding to the cities of Tulsa, Oklahoma, Omaha, Nebraska, Durham, North Carolina, and Knoxville, Tennessee. The latest round of grants emphasizes that these funds are for cities of all sizes. Some localities ascribe to the Choice Neighborhoods model and apply for multiple communities, as seen in the city of Tulsa and Omaha, which received their second Choice Neighborhoods Implementation Grants this year.
Applications for implementation grants are due by January 11, 2023. To learn more, click here."
10/06/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-210.cfm,HUD Charges New York Co-Op Apartment Owners for Discriminating Against Person with Disabilities,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced today that it has charged the owners of a New York City apartment, Lily and Shahram Daneshgar, with housing discrimination for allegedly refusing to rent to a person with disabilities because he requires assistance animals. Read HUD's Charge.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination based on disability. Such discrimination includes refusing to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services, when such accommodations may be necessary to allow a person with disabilities to use and enjoy their housing. A reasonable accommodation includes waiving a ""no pet"" policy for assistance animals.
""Reasonable accommodations, such as allowing assistance animals, ensure that people with disabilities have equal access to housing opportunities,"" said Demetria L. McCain, HUD Principal Assistant Deputy Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Today's charge demonstrates HUD's ongoing commitment to take appropriate action when housing providers fail to comply with our nation's fair housing laws.""
HUD's Charge of Discrimination alleges that a prospective tenant attempted to sublease a unit at the cooperative apartment building for himself and his partner. When the prospective tenant requested that he be permitted to live with his assistance animals, the Daneshgars terminated his application, stating that Ms. Daneshgar had allergies and they needed to protect their new floors.
""The Fair Housing Act requires housing providers to approve accommodations that are reasonable and necessary, and that includes permitting the use of assistance animals,"" said HUD's General Counsel, Damon Smith. ""HUD is committed to vigorously enforcing the Act to protect the rights of individuals with disabilities.""
A United States Administrative Law Judge will hear HUD's charge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds, after a hearing, that discrimination has occurred, the judge may award damages to the prospective tenant for harm caused by the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief to deter further discrimination, as well as payment of attorney's fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties to vindicate the public interest. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages to the prospective tenant.
People who believe they are the victims of housing discrimination should contact HUD at (800) 669-9777 (voice) 800-927-9275 (TTY) or the Department of Justice at (800) 896-7743 or 202-514-4713. Additional information is available at www.hud.gov/fairhousing and www.justice.gov. Materials and assistance are available for persons with limited English proficiency. Individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing may contact the Department using the Federal Relay Service at (800) 877-8339."
10/06/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-211.cfm,"HUD Closes Rental Assistance Demonstration Conversion in Cookeville, TN, to Support 48 New Affordable Rental Homes","Transaction with Highlands Residential Services is first phase of redevelopment effort to preserve almost 500 deeply affordable homes within growing area.
WASHINGTON, D.C. - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Office of Multifamily Housing is announcing today that it recently closed a Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) transaction with Highlands Residential Services (HRS), the Housing Authority in Cookeville, TN. This transaction will implement the first phase of a four-phase plan with HRS, which will ultimately preserve 499 deeply affordable rental homes for the Cookeville community as part of the Cookeville 2030 redevelopment plan.
Through this first phase of the RAD-supported redevelopment, rental assistance for 48 public housing units will be transferred from HRS's existing Claude Darwin Apartments to Hickory Valley, a new construction development. HRS will construct the 48 new rental homes tailored for families at Hickory Valley across seven buildings.
Through RAD, HRS is addressing the immediate and future affordable housing needs of the community through these investments, which will reinforce the property's ability to serve as affordable housing for the long-term.
The RAD transaction includes a $11.3 million construction budget ($235,00 per unit) fully financed through:
9% Low Income Housing Tax Credit Equity; and National Housing Trust Fund Grant
• 9% Low Income Housing Tax Credit Equity; and
• National Housing Trust Fund Grant
The 11.1-acre Hickory Valley site provides ready access to over 40 retail businesses and will offer residents easier access to the community's main economic opportunities, including to its two largest employers, the Cookeville Regional Medical Center and Tennessee Tech University. Additionally, the new units will allow for residents to have high-speed broadband and will have energy efficient LED lighting and new stainless steel Energy Star appliances. Additionally, four homes will be constructed for those with mobility challenges. The master plan for Hickory Valley also includes new roads, parking facilities, and amenity spaces for residents.
About RAD
RAD was designed to help address the multi-billion-dollar nationwide backlog of deferred maintenance in the public housing portfolio and to stem the loss of affordable housing that could no longer be kept to decent standards. From the program's inception through September 1, 2022, the Rental Assistance Demonstration has facilitated more than $14.9 billion in capital investment to improve or replace nearly 185,000 deeply rent-assisted homes, most of which house extremely low-income families, seniors, and persons with disabilities.
Under RAD, projects funded under the public housing program convert their public housing assistance to project-based Section 8 rental assistance. Under Section 8, residents continue to pay 30% of their income towards rent and the housing must continue to serve those with very low and extremely low incomes, as was the case when the property was assisted through the public housing program. Residents must be notified and consulted prior to conversion, are given a right to return to assisted housing post-construction so that the same tenants can enjoy these newly preserved and improved apartments and maintain the same fundamental rights they had as public housing residents.

10/07/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-212.cfm,HUD Awards $5.7 Million in Research Grants to Reduce Housing-Related Health Hazards,"Funding to improve methods to identify and control key residential hazards
WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today awarded $5.7 million to seven universities and public health organizations to improve our understanding of the longer-term impact of housing interventions targeting lead and other residential hazards, such as from pests, injury hazards, and asthma triggers.
Providing funds for these studies is extremely important for developing knowledge that helps to create and sustain new and existing housing that supports the health of residents. The studies focus on populations at higher risk of being affected by home health hazards, such as young children and seniors.
""The condition of a family's home is a major factor in determining their health, and today, too many homes have hazards, particularly, homes in communities of color,"" said Matthew Ammon, Director of the Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes. ""Supporting research on housing-related health hazards helps the Nation create and maintain homes that support the health and the safety of the residents.""
HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes promotes state, tribal, local, and private efforts to eliminate housing-related health and safety hazards from homes of lower-income families, stimulates private sector investment in controlling these hazards, supports cutting-edge research on assessing and controlling these hazards, and educates the public about the dangers of hazards in the home.

10/13/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-213.cfm,FACT SHEET: HUD Marks Important New Milestone in American Rescue Plan's Emergency Housing Voucher Program,"October 13, 2022
""At HUD we are pleased that over 35,000 households have been averted from homelessness and have successfully leased their own rental housing thanks to our Emergency Housing Voucher Program. This marks a major step forward in our efforts to realize the ambitious goals we set when the program was established through the President's American Rescue Plan. We will continue to meet the challenge of addressing our nation's homelessness and affordability crises with the urgency they require through this program, our House America initiative, and all of the housing assistance we provide."" - HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge
Today, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Marcia L. Fudge will travel to Atlanta, Georgia, where she will meet with several representatives from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) to discuss homeownership and asset building within their communities. Secretary Fudge will then travel to Columbus, Georgia to attend a meeting with NeighborWorks, where she will meet with residents to announce an important milestone in the Emergency Housing Voucher (EHV) program: With this milestone, 50 percent of the total number of EHVs provided through President Biden's American Rescue Plan have been leased up.
The Emergency Housing Voucher program is the first-ever special purpose voucher program within HUD to address homelessness not specific to veterans. The program is leasing at a rate faster than any previous housing voucher program within HUD and is driving unprecedented collaboration among public housing agencies (PHAs), homeless services organizations, and victim services organizations to provide housing assistance to vulnerable populations, including individuals and families who are experiencing or at-risk of homelessness; fleeing, or attempting to flee, domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, stalking, or human trafficking; or were recently homeless or have a high risk of housing instability. The EHV program is an anchor program of HUD's House America initiative in which HUD, the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH), and other federal agencies have enlisted leaders in 105 state and local communities to make specific commitments to re-house people experiencing homelessness into permanent housing.
The EHV program provides communities new flexibilities and resources to help individuals and families with higher barriers successfully use housing vouchers. This includes robust administrative funding and a new service fee that allows program administrators to pay for costs necessary to help families find and retain housing. PHAs are required to coordinate with their CoC partners to provide housing search assistance and can also use service fees for landlord incentives, tenants' security and utility deposits, and even for furniture and household goods, which are often a significant expense for families who are directly transitioning from homelessness.
HUD is taking aggressive action to ensure that more individuals and families can secure and retain homes. HUD and the Biden-Harris Administration will continue to build on this progress to make sure more households have a safe and stable place to call home. The Administration recognizes the importance of housing vouchers to securing affordable housing, and is fighting for an additional increase to the program. The President's Fiscal Year 2023 HUD Budget requests $1.6 billion for an additional 200,000 new housing vouchers.
Highlights to date include:
IMPROVING VOUCHER ISSUANCES AND UTILIZATION, WITH AN EMPHASIS ON THE MOST VULNERABLE HOUSEHOLDS
The EHV program has already helped over 35,000 households who were homeless, survivors of domestic violence, or otherwise at risk to afford a safe, stable place to call home. At the current rate - the fastest leasing rate of any previous HUD housing voucher program - the program is on track to reach full lease-up by the end of next year.
All 613 EHV PHAs have executed a memorandum of understanding with a homeless service provider or victim service provider, and, at 50% utilized to date, the EHV program is leasing at a rate faster than any previous housing voucher program within HUD. To date, approximately 100 percent of EHVs are in use - either leased or currently issued. Over 35,000 households have been housed, while another 36,000 voucher holders are in the process of searching for a unit or completing the lease process. PHAs continue to issue roughly 700 EHVs per week, and the time for issuance to lease is averaging 77 days. Of the vouchers issued 180 or more days ago, about 57% have been housed. At this rate, the program is on track to reach full lease-up by the end of 2023.

CREATIVELY USING SERVICE FEES TO HELP HOUSE INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES
PHAs across the country are creatively and successfully using their service fees to help house individuals and families, including through landlord incentives, housing search services, and application fees and security deposit assistance. Examples:
Housing Authority of Santa Barbara (California): The Housing Authority of Santa Barbara (HASB) - which has a 84% EHV utilization rate and has used 67% of its service fees - offers a $1,500 signing bonus to landlords leasing to an EHV family and a $2,000 security deposit for each unit leased to an EHV family. HASB established a Landlord Mitigation Fund that provides financial assistance to landlords to mitigate damages to units. Greenville Housing Authority (North Carolina): The Greenville Housing Authority (GHA) - which has a 96% EHV utilization rate and has used 59% of its service fees - provides a landlord leasing incentive that consists of $1,000 for a new landlord who has not previously participated as a landlord in a GHA program in the past 12 months and $250 for each additional unit leased, as well as a $500 one-time bonus for current landlords for the first unit leased and $250 for each additional unit leased to an EHV family. GHA also provides a Landlord Mitigation Fund that enables landlords to apply for up to $2,500 per unit for damages. Additionally, households may apply for application fee costs up to $50 and for security deposit assistance. San Diego Housing Commission (California): The San Diego Housing Commission (SDHC) - which has a 95% EHV utilization rate and has used 63% of its service fees - provides application fee assistance to EHV families, up to two times the contract rent in security deposits and an average of $100 in utility assistance per household, and ""holding deposits"" that are credited toward security deposit amounts upon approval of the rental application. SDHC also provides landlords renting to EHV recipients $500 for the first unit rented and $250 for each subsequent unit. SDHC hired full-time staff to serve as housing specialists/navigators. Staff members are specifically assigned to EHV families, facilitating landlord incentives, housing search services, service provider coordination, and rental assistance staff communication. Additionally, SDHC leverages funding from the City of San Diego Affordable Housing Fund to reserve vacancies while Housing Specialists identify candidate applicants and facilitate rental application submissions, process voucher documents, and execute the move-in processes. This Vacancy Loss Incentive serves as a benefit to give the Housing Specialists time to line up suitable tenant options while the owner is compensated for their collaboration with SDHC.
• Housing Authority of Santa Barbara (California): The Housing Authority of Santa Barbara (HASB) - which has a 84% EHV utilization rate and has used 67% of its service fees - offers a $1,500 signing bonus to landlords leasing to an EHV family and a $2,000 security deposit for each unit leased to an EHV family.

PROVIDING DIRECT SUPPORT AND LANDLORD ENGAGEMENT IN RESPONSE TO UTILIZATION CHALLENGES
From rising rental costs to difficulty finding landlords to the higher barriers to housing experienced by EHV households, the challenges around housing the most disadvantage are real. That is why HUD is proactively working with PHAs, providing direct support through technical assistance, engaging landlords, and providing other support and resources to address these challenges head on and ensure that more households can obtain decent, stable housing through the EHV program.
The Department is preparing landlord symposiums in housing markets across the U.S. to encourage more landlord participation in HUD's housing voucher programs and to dispel myths and misconceptions of voucher-assisted households. HUD provides monthly office hours to discuss a wide range of topics related to EHV best practices. Recent office hours topics include serving survivors of domestic violence, serving returning citizens, and serving youth households. The August 9, 2022 event on serving returning citizens featured presentations from Philadelphia and Baltimore on partnerships and using service fees to effectively serve formerly incarcerated individuals. HUD has provided direct technical assistance to 90 communities, including San Francisco, New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Atlanta, Tucson/Pima County, New Orleans, and others, to expand understanding of the program and its flexibilities and to build coordinated landlord engagement approaches. Examples of the types of technical assistance (TA) provided include: New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA)/ New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development (NYHPD) (New York) - HUD assigned TA to NYCHA and NYHPD to reduce bottlenecks in the referral process from the Continuum of Care (CoC) and other partner agencies. The TA provider worked closely with NYCHA and NYHPD to refine how applicants were guided through the system and provided helpful feedback on NYCHA's portal system to reduce wait times. The two PHAs have issued 7,345 EHVs as a result. Regarding the benefits of EHV technical assistance, NYHPD stated: ""Envisioning and building New York City's sweeping Emergency Housing Voucher initiative demanded we navigate a thousand complexities tied to launching a new program with a new set of partners. HUD's Technical Advisors assisted with devising solutions to help us deliver. Our TA partners brought housing groups together to plan through challenges; helped develop communications, training resources, and new media campaigns. Their support was crucial to shortening the learning curve as we worked to meet the needs of communities not historically given priority for federal vouchers. We look forward to continued collaboration to help New Yorkers navigate an especially competitive rental market."" Tucson and Pima County (Arizona) - HUD assigned TA to help develop and refine landlord incentive policies and landlord outreach. As a result, the PHAs have leased 127 families and 55 additional families are searching for housing. In response to the utilization challenges PHAs are experiencing in competitive rental markets across the country, HUD hosted a four-part EHV landlord engagement series. More information about the webinar series is available at www.hud.gov/ehv.
• The Department is preparing landlord symposiums in housing markets across the U.S. to encourage more landlord participation in HUD's housing voucher programs and to dispel myths and misconceptions of voucher-assisted households.
• HUD provides monthly office hours to discuss a wide range of topics related to EHV best practices. Recent office hours topics include serving survivors of domestic violence, serving returning citizens, and serving youth households. The August 9, 2022 event on serving returning citizens featured presentations from Philadelphia and Baltimore on partnerships and using service fees to effectively serve formerly incarcerated individuals.
• HUD has provided direct technical assistance to 90 communities, including San Francisco, New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Atlanta, Tucson/Pima County, New Orleans, and others, to expand understanding of the program and its flexibilities and to build coordinated landlord engagement approaches. Examples of the types of technical assistance (TA) provided include: New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA)/ New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development (NYHPD) (New York) - HUD assigned TA to NYCHA and NYHPD to reduce bottlenecks in the referral process from the Continuum of Care (CoC) and other partner agencies. The TA provider worked closely with NYCHA and NYHPD to refine how applicants were guided through the system and provided helpful feedback on NYCHA's portal system to reduce wait times. The two PHAs have issued 7,345 EHVs as a result. Regarding the benefits of EHV technical assistance, NYHPD stated: ""Envisioning and building New York City's sweeping Emergency Housing Voucher initiative demanded we navigate a thousand complexities tied to launching a new program with a new set of partners. HUD's Technical Advisors assisted with devising solutions to help us deliver. Our TA partners brought housing groups together to plan through challenges; helped develop communications, training resources, and new media campaigns. Their support was crucial to shortening the learning curve as we worked to meet the needs of communities not historically given priority for federal vouchers. We look forward to continued collaboration to help New Yorkers navigate an especially competitive rental market."" Tucson and Pima County (Arizona) - HUD assigned TA to help develop and refine landlord incentive policies and landlord outreach. As a result, the PHAs have leased 127 families and 55 additional families are searching for housing.

ADVANCING BEST PRACTICES AND ENGAGING PEOPLE WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE TO HELP MORE HOUSEHOLDS SECURE HOUSING
HUD is bringing together PHAs and people with lived experience to foster collaboration, address inequities, and strengthen support and resources to improve outcomes of the EHV program and other voucher programs administered by the Department.
HUD accepted 10 EHV communities to participate in the first cohort of a Community of Practice focused on advancing equity in the EHV program. HUD plans to use this Community of Practice to draw upon the strengths of communities to foster and encourage resource sharing, innovative thinking, and connections among PHAs, while exploring inequalities within their existing systems and developing system adjustments to ensure efforts to advance equity throughout the EHV program. Earlier this year, HUD released the Emergency Housing Vouchers (EHV): A How-To Guide for Public Housing Agencies (www.hudexchange.info/news/emergency-housing-vouchers-a-how-to-guide-for-public-housing-agencies-now-available/) to provide an overview of EHV operating requirements, outline considerations for PHAs in the design of their EHV programs, and highlight best practices in program implementation. HUD's efforts around the EHV program are informing work around the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program - the federal government's major program for providing housing assistance to over 2.3 million American families - and other Special Purpose Voucher (SPV) programs. HUD will bring the innovative approach of the EHV program to these other voucher programs to improve housing outcomes for households across the U.S. King County Housing Authority and Seattle Housing Authority - After an initial slow start in issuances and utilization, the two public housing agencies in Seattle/King County are now leading the region in their lease-up of Emergency Housing Vouchers. At the time of this writing, King County Housing Authority has leased 88.71% of their 762 awarded EHVs and Seattle Housing Authority has leased 80% of their 498 EHVs. Both housing authorities and their referring partner, the King County Regional Homelessness Authority, attribute this turn-around to improvements in coordination between the two PHAs and the King County Regional Homelessness Authority, leading to an increase in the pace of referrals of people experiencing homelessness, as well as a more coordinated and centralized approach to landlord recruitment.

ENSURING TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE EHV PROGRAM
HUD has prioritized informing the public on EHV leasing, issuances, and unit utilization to provide transparency and ensure accountability in the program.
In 2021, HUD launched the Emergency Housing Voucher (EHV) Data Dashboard to provide unprecedented transparency and accountability for this new special purpose voucher program. The dashboard provides updates (with potential delays as PHAs gather and submit data) on leasing, issuances, unit utilization, services fee spending, and information on voucher awards and funding by PHA. The dashboard showcases EHV data at the national, regional, field office, state, and PHA-level for ease of use by a variety of audiences. The dashboard is also a valuable tool for identifying communities that are facing challenges and that could benefit from additional assistance.

MAKING IT EASIER TO ACCESS AFFORDABLE HOUSING WITH VOUCHERS
The 2023 Fair Market Rents (FMRs), which HUD published on September 1 and which went into effect on October 1, will make it easier for voucher holders to lease in most markets. The new FMR levels will enable the voucher program to keep up with rent increases in the private market, particularly in areas with rapidly rising rents. These new FMRs will allow voucher holders to access and secure leases in more units so that they can benefit from the housing affordability and stability that vouchers provide. HUD's action on FMRs will improve the utilization of both the baseline vouchers and the supplemental vouchers created under the Biden-Harris Administration."

WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced a $12.4 million loan guarantee for the renovation and expansion of the Chick Webb Recreation Center in East Baltimore, Maryland.
The loan guarantee, offered through the Section 108 Loan Guarantee Program (Section 108) (www.hudexchange.info/programs/section-108/), will be used to finance improvements to a historic recreation center which was originally constructed in 1947 and was built as the first community center and pool for African Americans in segregated East Baltimore. Named after bandleader and drummer, William Henry ""Chick"" Webb, the facility was designated as a city Landmark in 2017 by the Baltimore City Planning Commission.
The Section 108 project will primarily benefit low- and moderate-income (LMI) persons on an area basis, where at least 51 percent of the residents are low- and moderate-income persons.
""Healthy communities thrive when they have vibrant, welcoming spaces to gather in,"" said Marion McFadden, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary, Office of Community Planning and Development at HUD. ""This loan guarantee will support Baltimore in their continuing efforts to build up this neighborhood and create an environment for community engagement.""
Section 108 provides Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds to communities as a source of low-cost, long-term financing for economic and community development projects that primarily benefit low- and moderate-income persons. Section 108 can be used for a variety of projects, such as housing, infrastructure, and other physical development projects. The flexibility of the program makes it an attractive and effective tool for state and local governments."
10/18/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-215.cfm,Federal Housing Administration Proposes to Adjust Title I Manufactured Home Loan Program Loan Limits Annually,"Consistent with the Biden-Harris Administration's Housing Supply Action Plan, today's proposed rule sets forth a methodology for regularly adjusting the limits on loans that finance manufactured homes titled as personal property.
WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) is announcing today the publication of a proposed rule (www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/10/18/2022-22535/indexing-methodology-for-title-i-manufactured-home-loan-limits) in the Federal Register to increase and index the loan limits for its Title I Manufactured Home Loan Program which insures loans used to finance manufactured homes titled as personal property. The rule seeks public comment on FHA's proposed data-driven methodology to calculate loan limits for the program on an annual basis. Today's publication is the latest step in FHA's efforts to promote manufactured homes, an important component of the Biden-Harris Administration's May 2022 Housing Supply Action Plan (www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/16/president-biden-announces-new-actions-to-ease-the-burden-of-housing-costs/).
""Adjusting loan limits to current market conditions will make Title I a much more useful source of affordable loan financing for manufactured homes,"" said Federal Housing Commissioner Julia Gordon. ""This proposal is the next step in FHA's ongoing work to support manufactured housing as an affordable and attractive option in a challenging housing market.""
Loan limits for the Title I Manufactured Home Loan Program were last updated by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. The proposed methodology will be used to establish indexes that annually calculate and adjust loan limits using sale prices, number of sections of the manufactured home, and property data collected by the U.S. Census Bureau. FHA's proposal includes separate indexes for single section manufactured homes and multi-section manufactured homes for the three loan categories covered under the Title I Manufactured Home Loan Program:
• Manufactured Home Loans used for the purchase or refinance of manufactured home only;
• Manufactured Home Lot Loans used for the purchase or refinance of the land where the home will be installed; and
• Manufactured Home and Lot Combination Loans used for the purchase or refinance of both the home and the land on which the home will be installed.
In November 2021, FHA published revised and enhanced Title I Manufactured Home Loan Program policies in its Single Family Housing Policy Handbook 4000.1. These changes made it easier for lenders to understand and use the program while providing expanded eligibility requirements for loan financing that are consistent with the criteria for income and property valuations used in real-estate mortgage financing."

WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Office of Multifamily Housing Programs (HUD) is announcing today that construction investment for affordable housing preservation through the Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) program has surpassed $15 billion since the program's inception in 2013. Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) across the nation have leveraged RAD to obtain this financing for the construction, rehabilitation, and preservation of more than 185,000 deeply affordable rental homes for low-income families, seniors, and persons with disabilities.
""$15 billion is more than a just a number - it represents a substantial long-term investment in the homes and lives of people,"" said Deputy Assistant Secretary for Multifamily Housing Programs Ethan Handelman. ""Innovative use of RAD by Public Housing Authorities working with public and private sector partners, residents, and HUD has leveraged critical capital investments to help turn around the nation's aging public housing stock.""
In the last nine years, the RAD program has provided the platform for PHAs to recapitalize and infuse new public and private investment into deeply affordable rental housing while preserving the affordability of these rental homes in perpetuity. RAD has unlocked over $15 in funding for every $1 of public housing appropriated funds.
Specifically, the program works to create and preserve affordable rental homes through HUD's project-based rental assistance programs, including the Section 8 program, while facilitating the use of other affordability options, including the Treasury Department's Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Program.
From its inception in 2013 through September 30, 2022, the program has helped PHAs across the country to:
Secure and preserve housing under Section 8 for approximately 468,000 individuals. Convert 1,533 public housing properties, covering approximately 185,000 affordable rental homes, to the Section 8 platform, and facilitate the creation of 15,000 Low-Income Housing Tax Credit units. Increase the per-unit rehabilitation spending by PHAs within RAD, averaging $144,000 per home in 2022 versus $55,000 per home on average in the first five years of the Demonstration. Finance $6 billion of construction at properties with greater capital needs by utilizing the innovative RAD/Section 18 blend to modernize and preserve 30,647 public housing units across 142 properties since 2018. Leverage 140 transfers of assistance to help PHAs relocate 8,300 affordable homes to neighborhoods where the poverty rate is on average 24 percent lower than the rate at the original site. See additional RAD data here (www.radresource.net/pha_data2020.cfm).

About RAD
RAD was designed to help address the multi-billion-dollar nationwide backlog of deferred maintenance in the public housing portfolio and to stem the loss of affordable housing from falling into disrepair. Under RAD, projects funded under the public housing program convert their public housing assistance to project-based Section 8 rental assistance. Under Section 8, residents continue to pay 30% of their income towards rent and the housing must continue to serve those with very low and extremely low incomes, as was the case when the property was assisted through the public housing program. Residents must be notified and consulted prior to conversion and are given a right to return to assisted housing post-construction so that the same tenants can enjoy these newly preserved and improved apartments.

More programmatic information is available at the RAD website. Data on RAD is available at the RAD Resource Desk (www.radresource.net/pha_data2020.cfm).

WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today awarded $83.7 million to build systems to end youth homelessness in 17 local communities, including 6 rural communities. The funding was awarded through HUD's Youth Homelessness Demonstration Program (YHDP) to support a wide range of housing programs including rapid rehousing, permanent supportive housing, transitional housing, and host homes.
""Placing young people experiencing homelessness into permanent housing can change the trajectory of their lives,"" said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""With this funding, HUD is targeting federal resources to meet local needs and support community-driven efforts to end youth homelessness and improve outcomes through stable housing and services.""
The Department continues to work closely with youth to develop and improve YHDP, relying upon recommendations provided directly from young people who have experienced homelessness. Additionally, HUD partnered with youth with lived experience to assess the applications that were submitted for funding consideration. Their assessment helped HUD ensure that applicants understood the needs and preferences of the young people they will serve. The Department also worked closely with its federal partners to help develop the program and review applications, including the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Education, and the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness.
YHDP recipients will use their funding to address youth homelessness that is specifically tailored to their needs, including funding for housing units, wrap-around services, and housing support. YHDP will also support youth-focused performance measurement and coordinated entry systems. Over the next several months, selected communities will work with their youth advisory boards, child welfare agencies, and other community partners to create a comprehensive community plan to end youth homelessness. HUD has been conducting a formal evaluation of first 10 communities who received YHDP grants. Preliminary evaluation results found that YHDP grantees made significant progress in developing youth-informed programs and systems, resulting in positive perceptions among youth of both the implementation process and available programs. The following communities have been awarded funding:

10/24/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-220.cfm,FACT SHEET: HUD Deploys First Round of Funding through New Rapid Response Program to Address Homelessness in Areas Hit by Disasters,"Initial Allocation of $6.8 Million to Florida and Seven of the State's Localities
Today, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Marcia L. Fudge will travel to Orlando, Florida, where she will announce the first round of funding allocations through the department's new Rapid Unsheltered Survivor Housing (RUSH) program, a rapid response program to address homelessness by filling in federal assistance gaps in communities hit by disasters. The first round of funding will consist of $6.8 million to the State of Florida and seven of the state's localities impacted by Hurricane Ian.
Secretary Fudge believes that we have an obligation to meet the long-term housing and services needs of people experiencing homelessness whose needs are exacerbated by disasters, and people who are at-risk of longer-term homelessness as a result of disasters. By allocating these funds, Secretary Fudge is delivering for these individuals and families and underscoring the important role HUD plays in long-term disaster recovery.
Rapid Unsheltered Survivor Housing (RUSH)
HUD has funding available to allocate to states and localities for severe disasters under the Emergency Solutions Grants (ESG) program. Given its unique nature, HUD is referring to this funding as the new Rapid Unsheltered Survivor Housing (RUSH) program. RUSH funding is available to help communities provide outreach, emergency shelter, rapid re-housing, and other assistance to people experiencing or at risk of homelessness who are in a disaster affected area but who cannot access all services provided by FEMA programs.
HUD is using new reallocation authority provided by section 231 of its FY 2020 appropriation. HUD currently has $56 million set aside for this purpose and plans to make the first allocation under this authority to the State of Florida and seven Florida localities to assist communities affected by Hurricane Ian.
RUSH will:
RUSH will fill a gap in federal disaster assistance for people experiencing or at risk of experiencing homelessness. People experiencing pre-disaster homelessness have very limited eligibility for FEMA Transitional Sheltering Assistance (TSA). Because FEMA doesn't provide long-term housing assistance, when short-term FEMA assistance ends, many displaced people wind up at risk of staying homeless long term. Adding to the problem is that rents often increase after disasters. RUSH fills this gap in assistance, giving communities much-needed resources to provide long-term housing solutions for people experiencing pre-disaster homelessness and to prevent long-term homelessness among newly-displaced people. To provide assistance to those most at risk, RUSH funding will be available to support people experiencing homelessness - those living in an emergency shelter, transitional housing, or a place not meant for human habitation - and people at risk of homelessness - those who have below 30 percent of area median income and either live in severe overcrowding, face eviction in the next 21 days, or have another risk factor for homelessness. RUSH provides funding for eligible activities including emergency shelter; rapid re-housing, which provides up to 24 months of rental assistance, financial assistance for move in costs, and supportive services for people currently experiencing homelessness; homelessness prevention, which provides up to 24 months of rental assistance, utility assistance, and supportive services for people at risk of homelessness; and outreach assistance, including assistance to meet urgent needs, for people who are unsheltered. RUSH will streamline the consultation and public participation requirements for the standard ESG program. The ESG program normally requires extensive consultation and public participation to plan for and utilize funding. HUD has authority to reduce those requirements for the disaster: for the first allocation, there will be no consultation or public participation requirements, and for the second allocation, recipients will have to provide for a five-day comment period rather than the normal 30-day period. RUSH will eliminate the match requirement for the standard ESG program. ESG normally has a 100% recipient match requirement, but HUD will waive that requirement using RUSH authority.

Because RUSH has limited funds, it cannot assist communities after every disaster. For this first round of funding, HUD is providing allocations only after FEMA activation of Transitional Sheltering Assistance, which is done in disasters where there is a high level of displacement and lasting damage to housing. RUSH is responding to the surge in shelter needs that has the knock-on effect of potentially forcing out persons experiencing homelessness prior to the disaster.
To balance the need to rapidly assist people affected by disaster and accurately allocate funds based on need, HUD will use a two-step allocation process. This first allocation will utilize existing data on the extent of homelessness and the capacity of recipients to administer homeless assistance programs (measured by expenditure of at least 60% of supplemental ESG funding to prevent, prepare for, and respond to the coronavirus). The second allocation will come later in 2022 and will employ data on the extent of damage, particularly for rental units occupied by very-low-income households.
HUD's Role in Long-Term Disaster Recovery
Following disasters, HUD's primary role is to facilitate long-term recovery and meet long-term housing needs. RUSH goes beyond temporary, short-term assistance to ensure that impacted individuals and families are still being served down the line.
HUD's long-term recovery assistance also includes:
The Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) (www.hudexchange.info/programs/cdbg-dr/) program provides funding to eligible cities, counties, and states to meet the housing and community development recovery needs of low-to-moderate income communities not addressed by other federal disaster assistance programs. The Community Development Block Grant Mitigation (CDBG-MIT) (www.hudexchange.info/programs/cdbg-mit/) program provides assistance to CDBG-DR funding recipients to carry out high impact disaster mitigation activities to better protect disaster-impacted low-to-moderate income communities in the future. HUD has created several toolkits to assist community recovery efforts to build back better, including the Community Resilience Toolkit (https://files.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/HUD-Community-Resilient-Toolkit.pdf) and HUD's Office of Policy Development and Research's Disaster Recovery Toolkit (www.huduser.gov/portal/disaster-recovery.html).

WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Secretary Marcia L. Fudge will hold a virtual 'House Party' to share information on available federal resources and bust common myths around the homebuying process. This event is to help encourage young adults who wish to become homeowners but feel the barriers are too steep, especially in communities of color.
""Too many young people feel discouraged and intimidated by the homebuying process and HUD is here to help,"" said Secretary Fudge. ""Thanks to student loan forgiveness, many young adults may have more money in their pockets and there are many resources available to help people realize the dream of homeownership. HUD and the Federal Housing Administration are dedicated to helping more young people realize their dream of becoming homebuyers and enjoying the wealth-building benefits that come with it.""
Research shows that young adult homeownership has been in decline since the 1960s. The Urban Institute predicts that this pattern will continue for the next several decades, but the decline will be even more dramatic for African Americans. Secretary Fudge plans to address myths on debt and credit as well as share information on how federal programs can assist those who view homeownership as an impossibility.
The 'party' takes place November 1 at 6:30 p.m. ET. To register for this event, please visit hud.gov/hudhousepartyregistration."
10/26/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-222.cfm,HUD Statement on Alexander County Housing Authority,"The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today met with residents of the Alexander County Housing Authority (ACHA) in Cairo, Illinois. The meeting was to inform ACHA's Smith Building residents of the need to relocate due to structural concerns that were identified in a recent structural assessment.
As part of the planning for structural modifications and seismic retrofits to the Smith building, an independent structural engineer performed a preliminary assessment of the building. This assessment highlighted an issue with the foundation and wood piles at the Smith Building.
A further study was performed in July 2022, on the site due to its adjacency to the Ohio River. In reviewing the building construction, soil samples, and the original 1966 building foundation design, the engineers concluded that the building may not survive an earthquake event from the nearby New Madrid Seismic Zone (NMSZ). It was HUD's intent to preserve the Smith building for the long term.
Based on the findings of the study, HUD has deemed it necessary to relocate all 53 families living in the Smith building.
Additionally, HUD is conducting an assessment to the Shuemaker building and will inform residents of those results as soon as they are available. Current engineering reports indicate there is no immediate threat to the Shuemaker Building.
Since taking possession of ACHA in 2016, HUD has invested millions of dollars ($10.6M) into the repair and renovation of ACHA's properties. This work has included repairs to roofs, facades, elevators, and plumbing systems. HUD has also prioritized safety and security measures.
""The health, safety and long-term housing stability of the residents is our top priority,"" said James Cunningham, HUD Midwest Deputy Regional Administrator. ""This is not the outcome any of us would have hoped for, but we are committed to ensuring the safety of our residents and working with each family to get them through this difficult transition."""
10/26/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-229.cfm,HUD and Census Bureau Report New Residential Sales in September 2022,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Census Bureau jointly announced the following new residential sales statistics for September 2022:

New Home Sales Sales of new single-family houses in September 2022 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 603,000, according to estimates released jointly by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. This is 10.9 percent (±15.2 percent)* below the revised August rate of 677,000 and is 17.6 percent (±15.9 percent) below the September 2021 estimate of 732,000.
Sales Price The median sales price of new houses sold in September 2022 was $470,600. The average sales price was $517,700.
For Sale Inventory and Months' Supply The seasonally-adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of September was 462,000. This represents a supply of 9.2 months at the current sales rate.

EXPLANATORY NOTES
These statistics are estimated from sample surveys. They are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated average relative standard errors of the preliminary data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. Changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show irregular movement. It takes 4 months to establish a trend for new houses sold. Preliminary new home sales figures are subject to revision due to the survey methodology and definitions used. The survey is primarily based on a sample of houses selected from building permits. Since a ""sale"" is defined as a deposit taken or sales agreement signed, this can occur prior to a permit being issued. An estimate of these prior sales is included in the sales figure. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimate of total sales is revised about 5.8 percent. Changes in sales price data reflect changes in the distribution of houses by region, size, etc., as well as changes in the prices of houses with identical characteristics. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau's website (www.census.gov/construction/nrs/how_the_data_are_collected/index.html).
* The 90 percent confidence interval includes zero. In such cases, there is insufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero."

WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Office of Multifamily Housing Programs announced today that it is opening a new application period for COVID-19 Supplemental Payment (CSP) funding. This will provide owners of Multifamily properties participating in assisted housing programs an opportunity to apply for more than $148 million in supplemental operating funds to support expenses associated with protecting residents and staff from COVID-19. Owners of properties participating in HUD's Section 202 Housing for Low- and Very-Low Income Elderly, Section 811 Housing for Low- and Very-Low Income Persons with Disabilities, and Section 8 Project-based Rental Assistance programs are eligible to receive reimbursements from this pool of funds for eligible expenses incurred from March 27, 2020, through January 31, 2023. The deadline for applications is February 21, 2023.
""We encourage property owners to make full use of these funds to help protect HUD-assisted residents from COVID-19,"" said Deputy Assistant Secretary for Multifamily Housing Ethan Handelman. ""Reimbursements are available for capital improvements such as ventilation systems and broadband installation, as well as the extraordinary operating costs properties have experienced, to help vulnerable residents in Multifamily assisted housing properties during the pandemic.""
This latest round of funding will allow owners to submit applications for reimbursement of eligible expenses incurred for the four previously announced operating periods from March 27, 2020, through October 31, 2021, and the new operating period announced today from November 1, 2021, through January 31, 2023. HUD has expanded the current list of eligible expenses to include reimbursement for resident training on use of technology to access on-line property management portals and supportive services, and costs to enhance outdoor seating spaces to facilitate gatherings. HUD has also extended the timeframe for delivery and installation of equipment categorized under eligible capital expenses and provided additional detail on reimbursements for allowable internet infrastructure costs and emergency generator purchase eligibility. The Department does not anticipate making future CSP funding available following this round.
About COVID-19 Supplemental Payments
COVID-19 Supplemental Payment (CSP) funds were allocated by Congress under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act. CSP funds help address operating cost increases incurred by owners to prevent, prepare for, or respond to COVID-19 at their properties. These payments supplement rental assistance funding. From July 2020 through September 2021, HUD's Office of Multifamily Housing Programs has disbursed $65 million in CSPs to owners with properties participating in Multifamily assisted housing programs."

11/03/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-225.cfm,New Data Shows 11% Decline in Veteran Homelessness Since 2020-the Biggest Drop in More Than 5 Years,"WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH) announced preliminary results of the 2022 Point-in-Time Count showing an 11% decline in Veteran homelessness since early 2020, the last time a full count was conducted. This is the biggest drop in Veteran homelessness in more than five years.
The data show that on a single night in January 2022, there were 33,136 Veterans who were experiencing homelessness in the United States - down from 37,252 in 2020. Overall, this represents a 55.3% reduction in Veterans experiencing homelessness since 2010.
""All Veterans deserve to have what they need to lead healthy, safe, and successful lives - that starts with a place to call home,"" said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""The data released today shows we are closer than ever in ensuring that every Veteran in America has a home and challenges us to ensure that every Veteran - and every person in America - has a home.""
""One Veteran experiencing homelessness will always be one too many, but the 2022 PIT Count shows that we are making real progress in the fight to end Veteran homelessness,"" said VA Secretary Denis McDonough. ""There is still a long way to go, but under President Biden's leadership, we at VA, HUD and USICH will not stop until every Veteran has a good, safe, stable home in this country they fought to defend.""
""Not only did we lower the number of Veterans experiencing homelessness, but we made this progress during a global pandemic and economic crisis,"" said USICH Executive Director Jeff Olivet. ""This proves that, even under the most difficult circumstances, we can take care of each other and address homelessness.""
The 2022 PIT Count is the first full PIT Count since 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic began. In 2021, prior to the widespread availability of vaccines, many communities did not conduct unsheltered counts (counts of Veterans in emergency shelters and transitional housing) in order to stop or slow the spread of COVID-19, resulting in an incomplete picture of Veteran homelessness in America.
Notably, the results from the PIT Count do not reflect the additional efforts launched by HUD, VA, and USICH in 2022, including VA's goal to re-house 38,000 Veterans (www.va.gov/HOMELESS/38k_National_Housing_Challenge.asp) in this calendar year. Through September, VA has placed nearly 31,000 homeless Veterans into permanent housing — putting VA on track to meet, or even exceed, its goal.
HUD, VA, and USICH are making progress using the evidence-based (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7427255/) ""Housing First (www.va.gov/homeless/nchav/models/housing-first.asp)"" approach, which prioritizes getting a Veteran into housing, then provides the Veteran with the wraparound support they need to stay housed — including health care, job training, legal and education assistance, and more. ""Housing First"" is foundational to the Administration's nationwide ""House America"" initiative to address homelessness by leveraging historic investments provided through the American Rescue Plan.
This progress has been made possible by the leadership of President Biden and the resources provided by Congress during the pandemic. With the passage of the American Rescue Plan, VA's homeless programs received $481 million in additional funding to support Veterans — including funding to expand the Shallow Subsidy Initiative (www.va.gov/opa/pressrel/pressrelease.cfm?id=5709), expand the Supportive Services for Veteran Families Program (www.va.gov/homeless/ssvf/index.html), address legal barriers to housing, and transform congregate transitional housing (www.va.gov/opa/pressrel/pressrelease.cfm?id=5775) spaces into individual rooms with bathrooms, and more. Overall, the American Rescue Plan provided more than $5 billion (www.usich.gov/sites/default/files/document/USICH_American_Rescue_Plan_Guide.pdf) to assist individuals experiencing or at risk of homelessness, as well as more than $40 billion for housing provisions nationwide.
If you are a Veteran who is experiencing homelessness or at risk for homelessness, call the National Call Center for Homeless Veterans at 877-4AID-VET (877-424-3838). Visit the VA Homeless Programs website (www.va.gov/homeless/) to learn about housing initiatives and other programs for Veterans exiting homelessness."
11/03/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-226.cfm,HUD Awards $2 Million to Assess the Impact of Emergency Rental Assistance on Housing Stability,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today awarded $2 million in funding to assess the impact of the Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) program. Three awardees, Abt Associates; Princeton University; and the University of Pennsylvania in collaboration with the University of California at Berkeley, will receive the funds under the FY2022 Impact Evaluation of the Emergency Rental Assistance Program Notice of Funding Opportunity. The studies will produce policy-relevant evidence on the impact of the ERA program on people and communities, with a focus on housing stability and eviction outcomes.
As part of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the ERA program was established by Congress to assist households experiencing financial hardship with rent and utilities costs. The program, administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, was funded in two phases: ERA1 and ERA2. This research will evaluate the impacts of both ERA1 and ERA2.
""Past research on ERA has looked at the design of the program and performance outcomes, such as number of households served, expenditure rate, and the number of completed applications,"" said Solomon Greene, the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary within HUD's Office of Policy Development and Research. ""The insights gained through this research can help policymakers understand if the availability of ERA helped reduce eviction rates and improve other measures of housing stability, while controlling for factors such as individual-level characteristics, neighborhood characteristics, trends in eviction, and local eviction moratoria.""
To date, Treasury estimates state, local, territory, and Tribal ERA grantees have expended or obligated more than $40 billion and made more than 7 million unique household payments. Existing research shows (https://oes.gsa.gov/projects/era-equity/) that ERA funds overwhelmingly went to population groups at highest risk of eviction, including Black renters, renters with lowest incomes, and female-headed renter households.
""The Emergency Rental Assistance program is an unprecedented program that Treasury and hundreds of grantees stood up to provide relief to millions of households in need,"" said Verónica Soto, the ERA Program Director at the U.S. Treasury. ""We're excited to partner with HUD to better understand how Treasury and grantees' policies contributed to the program's impact in communities nationwide."""
11/03/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-227.cfm,FACT SHEET: New Point-in-Time Data Reveals Decrease in Veteran Homelessness,"November 3, 2022
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), along with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH), released initial results from HUD's 2022 Point-in-Time (PIT) count. The data point to an 11% decline in homelessness among veterans between 2020 and 2022, the largest drop in homelessness for veterans in more than five years. This drop in veteran homelessness coincides with the historic resources in President Biden's American Rescue Plan and a return to evidence-based, Housing First practices under the Biden-Harris Administration. The results below reflect a two-year interval due to disruptions in the 2021 PIT count due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared to 2010, when the Obama-Biden Administration first set a national goal to end veteran homelessness, homelessness among veterans has declined by 55%.

These data reflect the veteran-specific results from the 2022 PIT count, which are being shared in advance of a report that will be released later this year and will include the full results on homelessness overall and sub-populations. The PIT count is a rollup of data from local HUD partners across the nation who conduct a count of people experiencing homelessness in a specific geographic area. The count takes into consideration whether or not individuals or families being counted are sheltered or unsheltered, veteran status, and other characteristics. The definition of sheltered includes those who are living in a public or private shelter designated to provide temporary living arrangements. A person is considered unsheltered if they have a primary nighttime residence that is a public or private place not designed for or ordinarily used as a sleeping accommodation.

""HUD continues to do the work to support recovery from disasters that have disrupted and, in some cases, devastated the lives of survivors,"" said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""But we want to make sure that we are doing it in a way that is beneficial and equitable to those who were already underserved before the disaster struck. We must also push forward to build back stronger to prevent future destruction from disasters and climate change impacts as much as possible.""
HUD is allocating $1.447 billion to 10 local governments and 13 state governments that received partial CDBG-DR allocations for 2021 disasters, including Hurricane Ida, in March 2022. With the additional funds allocated today, HUD has now allocated a total of $3.660 billion to these 23 communities to recover from 2021 disasters and build inclusive resilience to future disasters and the impacts of climate change.
Today's allocation is part of a total of $2 billion appropriated for disaster recovery in the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2023 that funded the federal government through December 16. HUD will allocate the remaining $553 million for 2022 disasters when adequate data about those disasters becomes available.
As part of HUD's Climate Action Plan, an agency-wide strategy to advance climate adaptation and resilience, the department is committed to steering disaster recovery in a direction that ensures climate justice and racial equity are at the forefront of these efforts. The plan also supports the Biden-Harris administrations climate and equity focus found in the Executive Order on Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad (www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/27/executive-order-on-tackling-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad/).

Fudge hosted the virtual event ""House Party - Let's Talk About the House"" on Tuesday, November 1 to educate Millennials and Generation Z young adults about the government resources available to buy a home. HUD conducted outreach to underrepresented groups, like Black and Latino home buyers, and more than 6,000 people signed up to receive information about pathways to homeownership. The Secretary was joined by a group of special guests that included mayors of major cities, HUD assisted homeowners, HUD program experts, and community leaders.
""This party was about inspiring our future generation of homeowners to take the next step towards purchasing their biggest financial asset, their home,"" said Secretary Fudge. ""You don't have to start big, you just have to start. And you must know the resources available to you in order to be successful. I am hopeful that this event will continue to inspire and inform those who are ready to stay ready.""
Recent data shows that home ownership in Black, Latino and Asian households increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. HUD is committed to continuing to support home ownership through its public engagement. Following the house party and to support sustained engagement, HUD launched a webpage that consolidates information on the resources available to make home ownership a reality. The live conversation covered many topics, including what cities are doing to create more affordable housing options, local incentives and federal programs available to potential home buyers, the benefits of housing counseling, credit scores, student debt, side-hustles, and powerful personal testimony from young, first-time homebuyers who made the leap!

WASHINGTON, D.C. - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Office of Multifamily Housing is announcing today that it has closed a Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) transaction with the Housing Authority of Joliet (HAJ) in Joliet, IL, to preserve 113 affordable rental homes for low-income seniors at the housing authority's newly named Stevenson Crossing site in southwest Joliet.
The RAD transaction will convert the rental homes to HUD's Section 8 Project Rental Assistance platform and includes $16.1 million in construction renovations at the site, or $142,000 per home. The transaction is funded via:
9% Low-Income Housing Tax Credits Private First Mortgage Loan Public Housing Capital Funds Public Housing Authority Non-Federal Funds
• 9% Low-Income Housing Tax Credits
• Private First Mortgage Loan
• Public Housing Capital Funds
• Public Housing Authority Non-Federal Funds
The RAD conversion supports HAJ's priority to serve its senior residents, as its most recent needs assessment indicated 11 percent of City of Joliet residents who need affordable housing are aged 62 or older. While not currently a senior property, as part of the transaction HAJ has received approval to change the occupancy preference for Stevenson Crossing to seniors.
In addition to substantially renovating the property, including renovations for the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standard (UFAS), HAJ will be combining and reconfiguring efficiency apartments into larger one-bedroom homes. This will ensure more units are accessible for seniors with mobility impairments and for people with sensory impairments. The rehabilitation work planned for the property also includes replacement of the roof, appliances, and windows as well as updates to the bathrooms and kitchens.
About RAD
RAD was designed to help address the multi-billion-dollar nationwide backlog of deferred maintenance in the public housing portfolio and to stem the loss of affordable housing that could no longer be kept to decent standards. From the program's inception through September 1, 2022, the Rental Assistance Demonstration has facilitated more than $15 billion in capital investment to improve or replace more than 185,000 deeply rent-assisted homes, most of which house extremely low-income families, seniors, and persons with disabilities.
Under RAD, projects funded under the public housing program convert their public housing assistance to project-based Section 8 rental assistance. Under Section 8, residents continue to pay 30% of their income towards rent and the housing must continue to serve those with very low and extremely low incomes, as was the case when the property was assisted through the public housing program. Residents must be notified and consulted prior to conversion, are given a right to return to assisted housing post-construction so that the same tenants can enjoy these newly preserved and improved apartments and maintain the same fundamental rights they had as public housing residents.

11/14/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-233.cfm,HUD Investigation Finds Oklahoma Housing Providers Engaged in Racial Discrimination and Retaliation,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has issued findings for Cushing Housing, Inc., and property manager Oklahoma Property Management, Inc. (OPMI), both recipients of HUD funds. HUD found the respondents discriminated against tenants by failing to adequately respond to known serious racial harassment and retaliated by moving to terminate their tenancy. Read the Letter of Findings here.
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race by recipients of federal financial assistance. Cushing Housing and OPMI are required to comply with Title VI because they are a recipient and subrecipient, respectively, of Federal financial assistance from HUD.
""Bigotry and racial discrimination have no place in housing. It is inexcusable for a HUD-funded housing provider to discriminate and retaliate against its tenants while denying them the ability to peacefully enjoy their housing"" said Demetria L. McCain, HUD's Principal Deputy Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""This Letter of Findings of Noncompliance demonstrates HUD's unwavering commitment to ensuring that entities receiving HUD funding comply with their civil rights obligations and that all individuals have the opportunity to live in HUD-assisted housing, free from discrimination.""
The case originally came to HUD's attention when the complainants, a mother and her daughter, filed a complaint with HUD alleging that they had been discriminated against by Cushing Housing and OPMI due to the race of the daughter's boyfriend. When the daughter, who is white, was seen dating a man who is Black, the complainants became the target of severe and pervasive racial harassment from other tenants on the property. The complainants were repeatedly called racial slurs by other tenants and were threatened with racially motivated violence. HUD's investigation found that complainants repeatedly notified Cushing Housing and OPMI of the racial harassment, but the recipients failed to adequately address the harassment. When Cushing Housing and OPMI responded, it was in the form of a notice to vacate to both the complainant mother as well as the harassers. HUD's investigation thus revealed that the complainant mother was also unlawfully retaliated against for her efforts to have the harassment addressed.
HUD will attempt to seek remedial relief for the complainants and public interest relief through changes to policies and procedures through a Voluntary Compliance Agreement/Conciliation Agreement in an effort to make the complainant whole and eliminate discriminatory practices.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 877-8339 (Relay). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to hud.gov/fairhousing.

11/15/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-234.cfm,FACT SHEET: HUD Marks Anniversary of Bipartisan Infrastructure Law,"One year ago today, President Biden signed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (www.whitehouse.gov/bipartisan-infrastructure-law/) (BIL), into law, making the largest long-term investment in America's infrastructure and economy in history.
In the year since, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has worked with federal agencies and across levels of government to connect transformative investments in transportation, climate resilience, broadband, and water infrastructure with HUD's investments in affordable, quality housing:
Enabling Communities and Neighborhoods to Thrive
HUD announced the availability of $5 million in technical assistance funds that the Department received in the Fiscal Year 2022 budget to help jurisdictions leverage their infrastructure investments from BIL to increase housing supply - while avoiding displacement of residents and businesses. The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) received $25 million for a similar purpose, and the two agencies are working together to align the uses of these and BIL funds as part of a ""Thriving Communities"" (www.transportation.gov/grants/thriving-communities) initiative that was launched in June 2022. Deploying technical assistance in this way will enable more communities to thoughtfully plan and execute transformative infrastructure investments that better serve existing and planned affordable housing developments.
Improving Resilience and Housing Quality
Improving the quality and resilience of housing extends the lifespan of existing housing and lowers costs for families. HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes is partnering with the Department of Energy's (DOE) Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) (www.energy.gov/eere/wap/weatherization-assistance-program), which receives BIL funding, to further develop HUD's Healthy Homes and Weatherization Cooperation Demonstration grant program to mitigate health and safety hazards in WAP-eligible homes of low-income families. This hazard mitigation will allow these homes to be enrolled in WAP and have their energy efficiency and comfort improved. HUD is also using its funds to build state-level expertise, working with state energy offices and additional external stakeholders to direct states to multifamily weatherization training resources.
Increasing Reliable Internet Access
BIL included $65 billion to expand broadband in communities across the country, create more low-cost broadband service options, and subsidize the cost of service for low-income households. The largest program, the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program, enables states to competitively award subgrants to community anchor institutions (https://broadbandusa.ntia.gov/sites/default/files/2022-06/BEAD-FAQs.pdf), including public housing authorities. Most of that funding will go to states and territories to deploy high-speed broadband infrastructure in areas currently lacking access to such services, including HUD-assisted and low-income households. HUD also continues to partner with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to encourage sign-ups for the Affordable Connectivity Program (www.fcc.gov/acp), an FCC benefit program that provides discounts toward internet services and computer hardware for eligible households. Residents of HUD assisted housing are categorically eligible for this program. FCC's latest estimates suggest 733,287 HUD assisted households have benefited from the Affordable Connectivity Program so far, and HUD is working to increase the enrollment among its assisted tenants.
Eliminating Lead Hazards in Housing
BIL enables HUD to make meaningful progress on our commitment to eliminate lead hazards in federally assisted housing, including tribal housing. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) received $15 billion in BIL funding to replace lead service lines in drinking water systems, as well as additional funding to address contaminants in drinking water. HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes is coordinating with EPA to ensure these funding streams serve homes of low-income housing owners and renters.
Lowering Utility Costs for HUD Households
To help improve energy efficiency and lower utility costs for communities, including HUD-assisted properties HUD continues to connect and convene stakeholders in regional and local offices to highlight federal funding sources - including funding streams from BIL and HUD programs such as Home Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) and Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) - that can be used for improvements. HUD has also reduced the administrative burden for HUD-assisted household to access the $3.5 billion in BIL Weatherization Assistance Program (www.energy.gov/eere/wap/articles/weatherization-program-notice-22-5-expansion-client-eligibility-weatherization) (WAP) funding, by working with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to create ""categorical income eligibility"" for HUD-assisted households such as public housing, Project-Based Rental Assistance (PBRA), and Housing Choice Vouchers.
Delivering Opportunity and Investments to Tribal Communities
To help coordinate sanitation and water investments provided through BIL - including $3.5 billion to the Indian Health Service to build the infrastructure necessary to ensure a safe supply of drinking water, reliable sewage systems, and solid waste disposal facilities - EPA revitalized the Tribal Infrastructure Task Force (ITF) (www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/31/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-releases-tribal-playbook-announces-massive-new-tribal-funding-from-bipartisan-infrastructure-law/) through a Memorandum of Understanding between seven federal agencies, including HUD. Additionally, HUD has helped the U.S. Department of the Interior determine how to distribute its $216 million for Tribal climate resilience; promoted resources like broadband funding as part of the White House Council on Native American Affairs; and helped DOE with data for its allocation formula for its $550 million Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant Program (www.energy.gov/eere/wipo/energy-efficiency-and-conservation-block-grant-program-bipartisan-infrastructure-law-2021).

11/15/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-235.cfm,Federal Housing Administration Annual Report Showcases Continued Leadership in Affordable Home Financing and Strength of the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund,"Annual report to Congress highlights FHA's leading role in supporting affordable home financing for first-time homebuyers and borrowers of color, providing assistance to struggling homeowners, and addressing housing supply and affordability.
WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) today released its Annual Report to Congress on the financial status of its Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMI Fund), which is used to operate FHA Single Family mortgage insurance programs, authorized under Title II of the National Housing Act. The report highlights FHA's significant role in supporting affordable mortgage financing for first-time homebuyers and borrowers of color while continuing to assist homeowners affected by the COVID-19 pandemic to keep their homes. It also underscores FHA's work to support increased housing supply and affordability while reducing barriers to fair and equitable homeownership.
FHA's achievements in fiscal year 2022 are supported by a strong MMI Fund, as demonstrated by the Fund's capital ratio of 11.11 percent as of September 30, 2022.
""I'm so proud of FHA's work to make homeownership possible for our nation's underserved households and communities,"" said Federal Housing Commissioner Julia R. Gordon. ""Behind the bottom-line numbers are some two million individuals and families who were able to achieve homeownership or stay in their homes through hard times thanks to assistance from FHA.""
As the report notes, FHA helped more than one million homeowners who were behind on their mortgage payments to obtain an FHA COVID-19 Forbearance and/or an FHA COVID-19 Recovery option to stay in their homes despite the dislocations caused by the pandemic. In FY 2022, FHA reduced the number of serious delinquencies - mortgages 90 or more days past due - by almost half, ending with a serious delinquency rate of 4.77 percent on September 30, 2022. This number had reached more than 11 percent during the height of the COVID-19 crisis.
In addition to its focus on helping homeowners recover from the financial effects of the pandemic, the report speaks to FHA's work throughout the past fiscal year to reduce barriers to homeownership and increase housing supply and affordability. New policies include allowing the use of positive rental history as a factor in FHA first-time homebuyer mortgage underwriting assessments; revised guidance for calculating effective income for borrowers with employment gaps due to the pandemic; and program modifications to FHA's property disposition programs to provide priority purchase opportunities for owner-occupant buyers."
11/17/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-236.cfm,"HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge, Deputy Secretary Adrianne Todman Issue Statement Applauding First-Ever Ministerial Meeting on Urbanization and Climate Change at COP27","HUD taking action to address the climate crisis
Today, at the 27th U.N. Climate Conference (COP27), remarks were made on behalf Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Marcia L. Fudge at the first-ever Ministerial Meeting on Urbanization and Climate Change.
""The United States has taken bold action to protect our climate future over the past year,"" said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""At HUD, we're implementing our climate action plan, including improving efficient and resilient building standards to help low-and-moderate income residents benefit from the transition to clean energy. Global challenges require coordinated solutions. This first-ever ministerial is an important step toward protecting our climate future.""
""HUD is committed to working to build resilient communities and to address the effects of climate change"" said Deputy Secretary Adrianne Todman. ""We applaud the convening of the Ministerial Meeting on Urbanization and Climate Change at COP27.""
HUD has taken bold action to reduce the agency's energy and carbon footprint while putting our nation's communities on the path towards a more equitable, efficient, and sustainable housing infrastructure. At COP26, HUD released its Climate Action Plan in response to President Biden's Executive Order on Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad (www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/27/executive-order-on-tackling-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad/). HUD has been implementing this broad approach to the climate crisis that reduces climate pollution; increases resilience to the impacts of climate change; protects public health; delivers environmental justice; and spurs well-paying union jobs and economic growth. And, HUD is on track for meeting the milestones it established.
HUD has taken the following steps:
• Green and Resilient Retrofit Program: HUD received $1 billion from the historic Inflation Reduction Act, the most significant domestic climate action in U.S. history, for the Green and Resilient Retrofit Program. This will make funding available to support energy, water efficiency retrofits and climate resilience of HUD-assisted multifamily properties. This investment will improve the stock of affordable housing available to many low and extremely low-income families, often in marginalized communities, making it more energy efficient, healthier, and more resilient to extreme weather events.
• HUD Climate Communities Initiative: HUD, in partnership with local leaders, launched a suite of resources, support, and tools to help cities respond to equitably the climate crisis. This includes a climate resilience toolkit (https://files.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/HUD-Community-Resilient-Toolkit.pdf), implementation models, peer-to-peer learning opportunities, stakeholder engagement with underserved communities, and direct support to a cohort of climate cities.
• Mapping a Path Forward: HUD has committed to the creation of an Equitable Decarbonization Roadmap which will help establish a path for HUD's portfolio to meet the United States' climate commitment of reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, in a way that does not unduly burden low- and moderate-income households.
• Strengthening Resilience: HUD has updated CDBG-Disaster Recovery grant requirements to include a greater emphasis on climate mitigation, equity, and green building. This year, the agency created a Citizen Participation and Equitable Engagement Toolkit to aid CDBG-DR grantees in centering equity in disaster recovery programs through an enhanced citizen participation process.
• Green Building and Electrification: HUD will continue aligning building and substantial rehabilitation incentives and requirements with energy efficiency and equitable decarbonization goals, including requirements around achieving green building standards in new construction and substantial renovations. This will ensure HUD-assisted households are part of the shift to a low-carbon future.
• Good Green Jobs: HUD is working to implement the Inflation Reduction Act's once-in-a generation investments that will serve low-income homeowners and renters while also creating job opportunities for residents. This historic law will help address deep and long-standing inequities that have left tens of millions of Americans struggling to access affordable, energy efficient, and resilient housing.
• Healthy Housing: HUD announced the availability of nearly $590 million for programs to assess and remediate lead-based paint and other housing related health hazards. This funding will enable communities to mitigate the impacts of unhealthy housing, preserve affordable housing, enable older adults to stay in their homes, and to ensure that future generations can reach their full potential.

11/18/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-237.cfm,HUD Preserves 87 Affordable Rental Homes Through Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) Conversion with the Housing Authority of the City of Little Rock,"Recently closed RAD conversion transaction supports affordable rental homes across three properties in southwest Little Rock, AR
WASHINGTON, D.C. - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Office of Multifamily Housing recently closed a Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) transaction with the Housing Authority of the City of Little Rock, AR, to preserve and rehabilitate 87 affordable rental homes across three of the housing authority's properties: Sunset Terrace, Stephens Apartment Homes, and Central High Apartment Homes. The transaction includes a construction budget of $15 million to renovate the three properties, and the conversion of the rental assistance at the properties to HUD's Section 8 project-based voucher program. The three properties are all located southwest of downtown Little Rock.
""With this step, HUD is investing in affordable rental housing in Little Rock, Arkansas to ensure it's maintained and improved over time,"" said HUD Secretary Marcia Fudge. ""The improvements we are making will update HVAC systems, improve accessibility, and modernize the properties to provide families with safe, well-maintained homes.""
Sunset Terrace was built in 1942 as housing for military and manufacturing families during World War II. Due to the property's age, it has unmet capital needs, limited amenities, undersized homes, and Americans with Disabilities Act non-compliance. The property will be completely renovated using part of the $15 million in renovation funding leveraged through RAD. The rehabilitation will include the replacement of windows, flooring, cabinetry, and HVAC systems, and will expand kitchens, dining areas, bedrooms, and bathrooms. Homes will also be renovated to meet accessibility, mobility, and vision requirements. Exterior work will include replacement of roofing, siding, walkways, curbs, parking, plumbing, and utilities (sewer, electrical, gas, and water), and the addition of urban gardens and updated playground areas. The roof lines will be altered from 1940s architectural features to a more modern style.
Rehabilitation at the Central and Stephens properties will be less extensive due to their recent construction in 2011 and will include replacement of HVAC, lighting fixtures, flooring, interior and exterior doors, bathroom vanities and sinks, kitchen cabinetry, countertops and appliances, asphalt pavement, parking, and striping.
The transformation in Little Rock is made possible through a RAD program component that blends its use with Section 18 of the National Housing Act that allows for the disposition of obsolete public housing properties. A RAD/Section 18 Blend allows for the preservation and rehabilitation of affordable public housing rental homes that would otherwise become unavailable. Since its creation in 2018, over 60 Public Housing Authorities have completed almost 100 transactions using the RAD/Section 18 Blend. Through these conversions, PHAs were able to invest over $4 billion to substantially rehabilitate or redevelop approximately 25,000 public housing homes, providing significantly improved housing conditions for low-income families.
The Housing Authority of the City of Little Rock leveraged RAD to fully financing their $15 million construction budget through several sources:
Commercial Mortgage Public Housing Capital Funds HOME Funds National Housing Trust Funds 4% Low-Income Housing Tax Credits
• Commercial Mortgage
• Public Housing Capital Funds
• HOME Funds
• National Housing Trust Funds
• 4% Low-Income Housing Tax Credits
About RAD
RAD was designed to help address the multi-billion-dollar nationwide backlog of deferred maintenance in the public housing portfolio and to stem the loss of affordable housing that could no longer be kept to decent standards. From the program's inception through November 1, 2022, the Rental Assistance Demonstration has facilitated more than $15 billion in capital investment to improve or replace nearly 185,000 deeply rent-assisted homes, most of which house extremely low-income families, seniors, and persons with disabilities.
Under RAD, projects funded under the public housing program convert their public housing assistance to project-based Section 8 rental assistance. Under Section 8, residents continue to pay 30% of their income towards rent and the housing must continue to serve those with very low and extremely low incomes, as was the case when the property was assisted through the public housing program. Residents must be notified and consulted prior to conversion, are given a right to return to assisted housing post-construction so that the same tenants can enjoy these newly preserved and improved apartments and maintain the same fundamental rights they had as public housing residents.

11/21/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-238.cfm,HUD Increases Flood Insurance Options for Homeowners with FHA Mortgages Living in Special Flood Areas,"Federal Housing Administration to allow private flood insurance policies on insured single-family mortgages in special flood hazard areas
WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), through the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), is announcing today (www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/11/21/2022-25258/acceptance-of-private-flood-insurance-for-fha-insured-mortgages) that effective December 21, 2022, it will allow homeowners with FHA-insured mortgage financing to obtain flood insurance policies that conform to FHA requirements from private insurance providers. The change was announced through a final rule published in the Federal Register today and in a companion Mortgagee Letter, also published today, that provides implementation guidance for FHA-approved lenders.
FHA requires that insured mortgages for properties in Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)-designated Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs) have flood insurance. Previously, only flood insurance obtained through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) was permissible for FHA-insured mortgages, which limited choices for consumers.
""Today, HUD is increasing the flood insurance choices available to individuals and families with FHA-insured loans in areas that FEMA has designated to be at special risk for flooding,"" said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""Flood insurance is required to ensure families and individuals are prepared if disaster strikes. Increasing consumer options for this important protection is one way we are building more resilient communities in the face of climate change.""
""We know borrowers face affordability challenges right now, yet a flood can be devastating to a family who is not properly insured,"" said Federal Housing Commissioner Julia Gordon. ""The choice to select a private flood insurance option may enable some borrowers to obtain policies that are less expensive or provide enhanced coverage.""
As part of its implementation, as of December 21, 2022, FHA will require lenders to provide detailed flood insurance coverage information when electronically submitting mortgages for FHA insurance on properties in SFHAs. This data collection is an objective included in HUD's Climate Action Plan and will allow FHA to capture and analyze flood insurance information on mortgages in its portfolio at a more granular level than has been possible previously.
Ensuring that borrowers are protected against flood risk is a key component of HUD's Climate Action Plan. In 2021, HUD released its Climate Action Plan in response to President Biden's Executive Order on Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad (www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/27/executive-order-on-tackling-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad/). HUD has been implementing this broad approach to the climate crisis that reduces climate pollution; increases resilience to the impacts of climate change; protects public health; delivers environmental justice; and spurs well-paying union jobs and economic growth. The action today further guides the integration of climate resilience and environmental justice into HUD's core programs and policies.

11/22/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-239.cfm,HUD Enters Agreement with Atlanta Housing Authority to Resolve Compliance Review Findings of Disability Discrimination,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has approved a Voluntary Compliance Agreement (VCA) with the Housing Authority of the City of Atlanta, Georgia (AHA) resolving findings that arose from a compliance review. During the course of the compliance review, the AHA acknowledged that it needed to improve monitoring and oversight for reasonable accommodations requests from tenants who resided at properties that fell under AHA's oversight. Read the Agreement.
The findings by HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (FHEO) stated that the AHA failed to comply with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (Section 504) and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) by inadequately monitoring its subrecipient housing providers, who failed to process and delayed reasonable accommodation requests, as well as insufficient record keeping of such requests as required under HUD regulations.
Section 504 provides that no otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States shall, on the grounds of disability, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be otherwise subjected to discrimination under any program or activity that receives federal financial assistance, including from HUD. Title II of the ADA similarly prohibits disability discrimination, and extends to all services, programs, or activities of any public entity, including public housing agencies. FHEO's compliance review demonstrated that AHA should make significant improvements to meet its responsibilities under both laws.
""Public housing providers who receive federal assistance have a responsibility to ensure equal opportunity in housing for all the residents they serve,"" said Demetria L. McCain, HUD's Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD is committed to using all of its tools, including compliance reviews, to tackle housing discrimination, including discrimination against individuals with disabilities. We are pleased AHA engaged with the conciliation process with an eye toward resolution of this matter.""
FHEO's systemic compliance review of the housing provider included over 400 interviews of tenants, staff interviews, interrogatories of property managers, and the review of hundreds of policy and procedure documents. The Letter of Findings identified numerous issues with AHA's oversight and enforcement of Section 504 for its housing partners and specifically identified 15 victims of discrimination based on disability.
The three-year VCA that AHA entered includes a $2 million dollar victims fund that will pay compensation to the parties outlined in the LOF and to additional unidentified parties who have a right to have their accommodation denial reviewed. The VCA also requires extensive changes to the AHA's monitoring and oversight of its subrecipient housing partners, such as increased training, monthly audits of reasonable accommodation logs, an updated website and grievance policies, and other provisions to ensure that persons with disabilities can request and receive reasonable accommodations.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 877-8339 (Relay). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to hud.gov/fairhousing."

New Home Sales Sales of new single-family houses in October 2022 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 632,000, according to estimates released jointly today by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. This is 7.5 percent (±20.8 percent)* above the revised September rate of 588,000, but is 5.8 percent (±19.6 percent)* below the October 2021 estimate of 671,000.
Sales Price The median sales price of new houses sold in October 2022 was $493,000. The average sales price was $544,000.
For Sale Inventory and Months' Supply The seasonally-adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of October was 470,000. This represents a supply of 8.9 months at the current sales rate.

EXPLANATORY NOTES
These statistics are estimated from sample surveys. They are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated average relative standard errors of the preliminary data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. Changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show irregular movement. It takes 4 months to establish a trend for new houses sold. Preliminary new home sales figures are subject to revision due to the survey methodology and definitions used. The survey is primarily based on a sample of houses selected from building permits. Since a ""sale"" is defined as a deposit taken or sales agreement signed, this can occur prior to a permit being issued. An estimate of these prior sales is included in the sales figure. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimate of total sales is revised about 5.8 percent. Changes in sales price data reflect changes in the distribution of houses by region, size, etc., as well as changes in the prices of houses with identical characteristics. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau's website (www.census.gov/construction/nrs/how_the_data_are_collected/index.html).
* The 90 percent confidence interval includes zero. In such cases, there is insufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero."

WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced the members of the first-ever Tribal Intergovernmental Advisory Committee (TIAC). HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge is launching the committee to strengthen the nation-to-nation relationship between HUD and Tribal communities, coordinate policy across all HUD programs, and advise on the housing priorities of the American Indian and Alaska Native peoples. The function of TIAC is not to replace Tribal consultation, but rather serve as a tool to supplement it. The establishment of this first ever committee (www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2022-11-29/pdf/2022-25726.pdf) follows consistent engagement between HUD and Tribes across the county.
Announced during Native American Heritage Month and preceding the 2022 White House Tribal Nations Summit, the committee is born out of a 2021 Presidential memorandum (www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/26/memorandum-on-tribal-consultation-and-strengthening-nation-to-nation-relationships/) that directed all federal agencies to take actions to strengthen their policies and practices on Tribal consultation. That same year, HUD Secretary Fudge announced her intention to establish the first HUD Tribal advisory committee. Public comment was taken into consideration regarding both the structure of the committee and the nomination of its members. HUD's goal in selecting the committee members was to reflect appropriate representation across the federally recognized tribes. Several HUD representatives will serve on the committee as well.
""With the creation of the first-ever Tribal Intergovernmental Advisory Committee, HUD continues to answer the President's call to strengthen our relationships with our Tribal partners,"" said HUD Secretary Marcia Fudge, ""As we commemorate Native American Heritage Month, I'm proud to move forward alongside this new Committee with such esteemed members, who will help us to address the unique concerns of Indian Country.""
""During Native American Heritage Month, we celebrate the many contributions of American Indians and the influence they have had on our country,"" said Deputy Secretary Adrianne Todman. ""I'm thrilled to work hand-in-hand with our new Tribal Intergovernmental Advisory Committee (www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2022-11-29/pdf/2022-25726.pdf) in creating increased opportunities for Tribes and Tribal communities.""

WASHINGTON, D.C. - Of the 49.5 million rental housing units in the U.S., nearly 46 percent are located in rental properties of one-to-four units, according to the latest Rental Housing Finance Survey (www.census.gov/data-tools/demo/rhfs/#/) (RHFS) data released today by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Census Bureau. For these small rental properties, 70 percent (15.9 million) are owned by individual investors, and more than one-third (8.1 million) have a mortgage or similar debt.
""The Rental Housing Finance Survey provides insight on the financial, managerial, and physical characteristics of rental properties nationwide,"" said Solomon Greene, HUD's Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research. ""Given that the survey was in the field during 2021, it will help the Administration to better understand how rental property owners responded to the COVID-19 pandemic.""
The Rental Housing Finance Survey is funded by HUD and is collected every three years by the Census Bureau. The RHFS is the most comprehensive survey of rental housing properties in the United States, covering topics such as property configuration, ownership and management, rental income and expenses, financing, and capital improvements and expenses.

11/30/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-243.cfm,HUD Proposes to Modernize Indian Home Loan Guarantee Program to Provide More Homeownership Opportunities for Native American Families,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced the release of a proposed rule for the Section 184 Indian Home Loan Guarantee Program, which will modernize the program regulations and encourage homeownership opportunities in Indian Country. The proposed rule expands and revises the existing program regulations and will codify program requirements, while introducing much needed clarity for participating lenders. In addition, the proposed rule will increase homeownership opportunities for Native American families by providing a federal guarantee on qualifying loans in the event of default and authorize HUD to establish a minimum level of lending on trust land.
""Homeownership can be a powerful wealth building tool, and that's why HUD is proposing updates to the Indian Home Loan Guarantee Program to create more homeownership opportunities for Tribal communities,"" said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge, ""By setting requirements, attracting more lenders, and setting a minimum standard of lending, we are taking steps to make homeownership a reality for American Indian and Alaska Native individuals and families. Today's proposed rule is a part of the Biden-Harris Administration's commitment to strengthening the Nation-to-Nation relationship with Tribes and making equitable investments in Indian Country.""
Often referred to solely as the Section 184 Program, the Indian Home Loan Guarantee Program is a home loan product that was specifically created for American Indian and Alaska Native individuals and families; Alaska villages; Tribes; and tribally designated housing entities (TDHEs). This program's underwriting requirements, low down payment and reduced fees make the program more accessible to Native borrowers. While the HUD's loan guarantee encourages participation in the program by lenders, thereby expanding opportunities to access mortgage capital in Indian Country.
Provisions of the proposed rule include:
Outlining of the requirements for Tribal participation in the Section 184 program. Outlining of the requirements for eligible borrowers, eligible properties, and loan types for the Section 184 program. Outlining of the requirements for Servicers to service the Section 184 loan and the loss mitigation required when a loan is in default. Outlining claim types and requirements to submit claims to HUD. Outlining of HUD's ability to conduct periodic performance reviews, reporting requirements for Lenders and Servicers, and sanctions for noncompliance with regulations.
• Outlining of the requirements for Tribal participation in the Section 184 program.
• Outlining of the requirements for eligible borrowers, eligible properties, and loan types for the Section 184 program.
• Outlining of the requirements for Servicers to service the Section 184 loan and the loss mitigation required when a loan is in default.
• Outlining claim types and requirements to submit claims to HUD.
• Outlining of HUD's ability to conduct periodic performance reviews, reporting requirements for Lenders and Servicers, and sanctions for noncompliance with regulations.
Today's announcement delivers on HUD's commitment to Indian Country to invest unprecedented levels of resources and strengthen relationships with Tribes. Yesterday, HUD announced the creation of the first ever Tribal Intergovernmental Advisory Committee which will ensure that a broad range of Tribal voices are included in HUD policy and program discussions. On November 30, the White House will hold its two-day Tribal Nation's Summit where federal leadership, including HUD Deputy Secretary Adrianne Todman, will have the opportunity to engage with Tribal leaders directly.

12/01/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-244.cfm,FHA Announces New Single Family Title II Forward and Home Equity Conversion Mortgage Loan Limits for 2023,"WASHINGTON - Today, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) is announcing new loan limits for calendar year 2023 for its Single Family Title II forward and Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) insurance programs. Loan limits for most of the country will increase in the coming year due to house price appreciation during the first half of 2022, which is factored into the statutorily mandated calculations FHA uses to determine the limits each year.
""The loan limits announced today reflect steep increases in home prices throughout much of the country and will ensure continued access to FHA-insured mortgage financing despite those increases,"" said Assistant Secretary for Housing and Federal Housing Commissioner Julia Gordon.
Forward Mortgage Loan Limits
The new forward mortgage loan limits are effective for FHA case numbers assigned on or after January 1, 2023:
• Mortgage limits for the special exception areas of Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands are adjusted by FHA to account for higher costs of construction.
The maximum loan limits for FHA forward mortgages will rise in 3,222 counties. In 12 counties, FHA's loan limits will remain unchanged. By statute, the median home price for a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) is based on the county within the MSA that has the highest median price.
HECM Loan Limits
The HECM maximum claim amount will increase from $970,800 in calendar year 2022 to $1,089,300, effective for FHA case numbers assigned on or after January 1, 2023. This maximum claim amount is applicable to all areas, including the special exception areas of Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
Calculation of Loan Limits
FHA is required by the National Housing Act (NHA), as amended by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA), to set Single Family forward mortgage loan limits at 115 percent of area median house prices for a particular jurisdiction, subject to a specified floor and a ceiling. In accordance with the NHA, FHA calculates forward mortgage limits by MSA and county.
The NHA requires FHA to establish its floor and ceiling loan limits based on the national conforming loan limit set by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) for conventional mortgages owned or guaranteed by the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac).
The national conforming loan limit for 2023 for a one-unit property is $726,200. FHA's 2023 minimum national loan limit floor of $472,030 for a one-unit property is set at 65 percent of the national conforming loan limit. This floor applies to those areas where 115 percent of the median home price is less than the floor limit. Any area where the loan limit exceeds this floor is considered a high-cost area. In these areas, FHA establishes varying loan limits above the floor based upon the respective median home prices in each area.
The NHA requires FHA to set its maximum loan limit ceiling for high-cost areas at $1,089,300, which is 150 percent of the national conforming loan limit. Forward mortgage limits for the special exception areas of Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands are adjusted further by FHA to account for higher costs of construction.
Additionally, the FHA-insured HECM maximum claim amount is calculated at 150 percent of the Freddie Mac national conforming limit of $726,200. FHA's current HECM regulations do not allow the HECM limit to vary by MSA or county; instead, the single HECM limit applies to all HECMs regardless of where the property is located.

12/05/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-245.cfm,HUD Awards $30 Million to Fund ROSS Service Coordinators to Support Needs of Public and Indian Housing Residents,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development awarded funding to hire and maintain Service Coordinators who will assess the needs of residents of conventional Public Housing or Indian housing in addition to coordinating available resources in the community. Service Coordinators assist residents of Public and Indian Housing to make progress towards economic and housing goals by removing educational, professional, and health-related barriers.
The ROSS-SC awards will go to 111 Public Housing Agencies (PHAs), Tribally Designated Housing Entities (TDHEs), Resident Associations, and Nonprofit organizations supported by residents, PHAs, and/or tribes/TDHEs across the country to fund 135 Service Coordinator positions. Key changes to the 2022 program funding includes raising the maximum salary for Service Coordinators, adding Digital Inclusion to the list of areas of need, and making direct services an eligible expense when there are service provider gaps. These changes will result in better, more consistent services and increased engagement with the local partners to address the needs of both the residents and the community itself.
""Through addressing residents' needs, we can increase stability in housing, health and personal finance. Service Coordinators encourage a holistic approach to providing for the needs of public housing residents,"" said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""These Service Coordinators will play an important role in supporting residents, particularly the growing demographic of the disabled and elderly, as they gain greater independence within their communities.""
The ROSS-SC program endeavors to ensure progress along a continuum through training and the use of supportive services. For elderly or disabled public housing residents this can also include the ability to age in place or remain living independently for as long as possible.
Core functions of the ROSS-SC Program include:
• Resident Needs Assessment: ROSS applicants/grantees must assess the needs of residents in the project(s) to be served to determine the critical needs that residents identify as barriers to achieving self-sufficiency. The Needs Assessment must ensure all residents have meaningful access to participate including persons with Limited English Proficiency (LEP) and persons with disabilities as required by Title VI and Section 504. The results of the needs assessment are a key component of your application.
• Coordination and Direct Service Delivery: The role of each ROSS-SC shall be designed to meet the needs of both individual residents and the local community they will serve. The ROSS-SC must build partnerships with local service providers, tribal departments, and/or other organizations to coordinate the delivery of services and to ensure that program participants are linked to the supportive services they need. The ROSS-SC must also assess any gaps in service delivery by existing partners/tribal departments/local service providers and may supplement these through subcontracts with other organizations possessing the expertise to fulfill the unmet needs of active ROSS participants. The ROSS-SC may also coordinate educational and/or community events that help residents achieve economic independence and stability.
• Case Management/Coaching: The ROSS-SC program must provide general case management to residents which includes intake, assessment, education, and referral to service providers in the local community and/or subcontractors.
• Resident Engagement: Grantees must find creative ways, including identifying local partners, to engage residents and Resident Associations in activities that help build organizational capacity and leadership; this can include supporting resident-led projects that address the needs of the community. This should include consulting the Resident Association(s) in the project(s) served by the ROSS-SC grant.
• Evaluation: Grantees must regularly monitor and evaluate the progress of participants, the quality of services delivered by partners and subcontractors, and the overall success of the program. Regular monitoring and evaluation will help grantees make any necessary changes to improve the implementation of their program during the course of the grant.
• Reporting: Grantees must submit an annual report to HUD. The annual report is due October 30th of each year. Final reports are due 90 days after the grant term ends.

12/06/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-246.cfm,HUD Policy Development & Research to Hold Quarterly Meeting to Discuss the Effects of Institutional Investors in the Housing Market,"HUD Secretary Marcia Fudge Delivers Opening Remarks
WASHINGTON - Today, December 6, 2022, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Office of Policy Development & Research (PD&R) will hold its quarterly update meeting to discuss the issues around institutional investors and their impact on housing markets across the United States. The event will include pre-recorded opening remarks by HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge before moving into two panel discussions.
This timely event will share research and data and will highlight what communities have done to preserve affordable housing. Since the start of the pandemic, the housing market has witnessed an increase in activity by large investors who often oversee more than 1,000 properties in their portfolio. This activity has produced a strain on the already limited prospects of first-time homebuyers and has deepened the gaps in racial wealthy and homeownership.
""Institutional investors have access to resources that make them impossible to compete with. This is especially true for minority first-time homebuyers, who already face institutional barriers,"" said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""HUD has taken steps to ensure that our defaulted assets will land in the hands of non-profits or individual owners, but this is a much bigger problem that will take everyone coming together to figure out how to sustain housing that people can afford.""
""This PD&R Quarterly will profile the impact of institutional investors in the housing market and provide examples of how various levels of governments, along with nonprofits, can drive housing supply to owner-occupants and mission-driven entities,"" said Solomon Greene, PD&R's Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary.

12/08/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-247.cfm,HUD Announces Improvements to Climate-Forward Housing Program,"Rate Reduction Incentive Program Enhancements to Encourage Public Housing Agency Participation
WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is announcing updated guidance on the use and eligibility of the Rate Reduction Incentive (RRI). The RRI serves as a climate-friendly incentive program available to Public Housing Agencies (PHA) that encourages them to reduce their utility rates beyond what is already required by statute and/or regulation.
The program directly supports HUD's Climate Action Plan which sets forth goals to create climate resiliency, reduce greenhouse emissions, and pursue environmental justice in housing. The RRI helps HUD move towards those goals since energy efficiency solutions made possible through the program reduce a PHAs carbon footprint, promote long-term sustainability, and can improve the lives of residents. Not only do the program benefits allow for cost savings for PHAs, but they will also pave the way for the shared benefits of better property quality, additional support to families, and improved property maintenance.
""This updated guidance will help to create more sustainable communities, including by offering increased support for residents,"" said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""HUD will continue to advance our Climate Action Plan with steps like these - which provide cost savings, benefit hard-working Americans, and looks out for our planet for future generations.""
The updates and changes to the guidance provide clarification on the approval process, additional supplemental direction, and changes to policy. The overarching goal is to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the RRI and serve as a reference guide that offers clear and consistent information. Policy-wise, the changes make it possible for a PHA to retain either 50% or 100% of their savings, depending upon the type of contract entered, and in a multiyear contract the number of documents and the process of administering eligibility requirements is reduced.
Here are a few examples, including some real-world scenarios, of actions PHAs can take that are allowed under the program:
PHAs can negotiate special rates with a utility company that are specific to the housing agency (this can be for a contract term of up to 5 years). PHAs can participate in the purchasing of power through a third-party supplier which can result in savings through invoice credits or a fixed utility rate. PHAs can work with utility providers who offer reduced rates for those who make efficiency upgrades to things like boilers, windows, or toilets. PHAs can take advantage of renewable energy sources, like on-site or community solar development. Here are a few examples: Developers in Rhode Island have developed a solar production facility by aggregating the power needs of nine (9) Housing authorities that are members of the Public Housing Association of Rhode Island (PHARI). The solar arrays will provide over 20 million kWh of electricity to authorities in Providence, North Providence, Newport, Cranston, Smithfield, Warwick, Warren, Bristol, and Lincoln. This renewable solar energy will offset estimated 29 million kWh per year that these housing authorities use annually. Albany Housing Authority is able to participate in a Community Solar Project that is producing 3.7M kWh of annual solar production. They will receive solar credits through this program from their utility provider. They also are able to benefit from the RRI program to retain a portion of the savings. Ithaca Housing Authority is able to participate in a Community Solar Project and receive a benefit through the RRI program to retain a portion of the savings.

12/08/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-248.cfm,HUD Charges Colorado Landlord with Harassment and Retaliation,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has charged Vernon Morgan, the owner of a house in Greeley, Colorado, with discrimination for subjecting a female tenant to harassment and retaliation because of sex. Read HUD's Charge.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from discriminating because of sex, including harassing tenants. Sexual harassment includes unwelcome sexual advances and comments, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical behavior that is sexual in nature. Harassment because of sex can also include conduct that is not necessarily sexual, such as offensive conduct or remarks pertaining to a tenant's actual or perceived sex.
""No one should feel harassed or unsafe in their own home because of their sex, and no one should fear escalated harassment or retaliation when trying to enforce their fair housing rights,"" said Demetria L. McCain, HUD's Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""As this charge demonstrates, HUD will stand with tenants to eradicate sexual harassment and other forms of discrimination by landlords.""
HUD's Charge of Discrimination alleges that Morgan harassed the tenant because of her sex. Morgan's harassing conduct allegedly included frequent unwelcome invitations to meals, trips, and other activities; sexual and/or gendered innuendos, comments, and gestures; derogatory and belittling comments; and peering into the tenant's windows from outside the property. According to the Charge, after the tenant told Morgan that his conduct was unwelcome and constituted sexual harassment, she pursued a protection order against him and reported the harassment to the local police. Morgan then retaliated against the tenant and sought to evict her. The Charge further alleges that because of Morgan's illegal actions, the tenant was forced to vacate her home.
""Landlords who subject tenants to harassment, discriminatory statements, and retaliation because of sex violate the Fair Housing Act,"" said HUD General Counsel Damon Smith. ""HUD is committed to enforcing the Act and holding those landlords accountable.""
A United States Administrative Law Judge will hear HUD's charge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds, after a hearing, that discrimination has occurred, the judge may award damages to the tenant for her losses as a result of the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, to deter further discrimination, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties to vindicate the public interest. If the federal court hears the case, the judge may also award punitive damages to the complainant.
People who believe they are the victims of housing discrimination should contact HUD at (800) 669-9777 (voice) 800-927-9275 (TTY) or the Department of Justice at (800) 896-7743 or 202-514-4713. Additional information is available at www.hud.gov/fairhousing and www.justice.gov."
12/08/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-249.cfm,HUD Announces Racial Equity Agreement with Affordable Rental Housing Provider,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has entered a Voluntary Compliance Agreement for Aboussie Pavilion Apartments, resolving a compliance review concerning non-discrimination in marketing and tenanting procedures. Aboussie Pavilion Apartments consists of two buildings known as Bevo and Bavarian for a total of 273 units in St. Louis, Missouri. The Property provides affordable subsidized units through the Section 8 program for families with a member who is 62 or older or has a disability. Read the Agreement.
This Agreement arises from a compliance review that was conducted by HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (FHEO) under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. FHEO opened the review based on information indicating disproportionately low participation rates of Black residents relative to the housing market. The review sought to ensure eligible persons were not discriminated against in opportunities to learn about, apply to, and reside in HUD subsidized housing on the basis of race, color, or national origin. In particular, the review revealed disparities in the Property's tenant screening practices related to credit history and criminal records which disproportionately impacted Black applicants.
HUD enforces the Fair Housing Act, which prohibits discrimination because of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, and disability. HUD also enforces other federal civil rights laws, including Title VI of the Civil Rights Act which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance.
""Tenant selection policies can create unnecessary barriers that result in illegal discrimination and denials of desperately needed housing. HUD funded housing providers must tailor tenant selection policies to avoid discriminating against applicants because of their race, color, and national origin,"" said Demetria L. McCain, HUD's Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""We are committed to advancing equity and embedding fairness in our decision-making processes. We take seriously our mission to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all, including those who have been historically wronged"".
The Agreement mandates a fund in the amount of $156,000 to compensate individuals who were denied due to credit history or criminal records during the review period. In addition, the Agreement requires creation of a new waitlist after robust marketing to those least likely to apply, committing a minimum of $10,000 towards advertising, outreach, and website development; revising all policies that include an evaluation of credit or rental history consistent with civil rights laws and HUD's guidance; and waiving move-in fees for formerly denied applicants who reapply and are admitted. This Agreement does not constitute admissions by the housing providers or evidence of a final determination by HUD of violations of Title VI or any other laws.
Individuals who believe they have experienced discrimination in housing may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 877-8339 (Federal Relay Service)."

SEATTLE - U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Deputy Secretary Adrianne Todman and U.S. Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal joined Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell, King County Regional Homelessness Authority CEO Marc Dones, and other officials and housing advocates to mark significant progress in its effort re-house households and increase the supply of affordable housing through their House America commitment. As of December 9, the King County Regional Homelessness Authority has distributed more than 1,200 emergency housing vouchers to households experiencing homelessness—one of the best lease-rates in the nation, and the Seattle Office of Housing worked with numerous partners to build nearly 800 units of affordable housing in the city. The event was hosted by the Chief Seattle Club with Executive Director Derrick Belgrade at a supportive local housing project that opened in January.
""HUD is pleased to work with the City of Seattle, under Mayor Harrell's leadership, to address the housing supply and homelessness challenges the city faces,"" said HUD Deputy Secretary Adrianne Todman. ""The Biden Administration is committed to connecting people to safe, stable, and affordable housing. We are proud of the City's sustained efforts in leveraging federal resources and collaborating with partners, which have culminated in Seattle exceeding their House America goals.""
In the last two years, the Biden-Harris administration has made unprecedented efforts to end homelessness, which include the White House Housing Supply Action Plan (www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/16/president-biden-announces-new-actions-to-ease-the-burden-of-housing-costs/) that aims to close the housing supply gap in 5 years; and the American Rescue Plan Act (www.usich.gov/sites/default/files/document/USICH_American_Rescue_Plan_Guide.pdf) that President Biden signed to deliver one of the largest investments in ending homelessness in U.S. history. As part of the American Rescue Plan legislation passed by Congress in March 2021, Secretary Marcia L. Fudge launched the House America initiative as part of the Biden-Harris Administration's direct response to the crisis of homelessness, which was rising even before the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic. House America is a national partnership in which HUD and the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness called on local, tribal, and state leaders across the country to partner in distributing 70,000 emergency housing vouchers and $5 billion in HOME grants to help more Americans struggling with homelessness to get re-housed, and build additional housing for people experiencing homelessness.
""The American Rescue Plan was one of the most ambitious, progressive, and responsive packages that we have passed in Congress, and it continues to pay dividends even now. The House America initiative and the entire housing assistance package in the American Rescue Plan helped us tackle a housing crisis that had been exacerbated by the COVID pandemic,"" said Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal. ""The results of this initiative in Seattle prove that we can get thousands of families housed and stable by working swiftly, decisively, and cooperatively across all levels of government. I was honored to help pass this bold package, and look forward to continuing our work to address the housing crisis in our district.""
Working together, the House America initiative leverages the Housing First approach that the City of Seattle and the King County Regional Homelessness Authority are using. Housing First is an evidence-based strategy recognizing that housing, and the safety and stability it provides, is a necessary first step to helping people rebuild their lives. Housing first is not housing only, but housing first starts with a solid foundation—a safe place to live—and builds on it with healthcare, treatment, social services, and education or work supports.
""President Biden and HUD's House America initiative shows a true commitment to combating the homelessness crisis by elevating the best solution we have - housing,"" said Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell. ""Through partnership and urgency, we have created hundreds of units for people to recover and restore their lives. We will not be complacent in our efforts to address unsheltered homelessness - we remain dedicated to setting ambitious housing goals and driving forward the historic investments in our budget necessary to meet and exceed them.""
To date, they have achieved the following progress goals:
Near full utilization of federally-funded Emergency Housing Vouchers, with 1,234 households already leased and moved in to safe and stable homes. This meets 94% of their goal of 1,314 households housed, with a leasing rate that is one of the best in the nation, and nearly double that of peer cities. Creation of 796 new units of affordable housing in the City of Seattle, exceeding our goal of 772 new units. These new units represent 12 new affordable housing buildings that opened in 2022 and are located in 10 different neighborhoods across Seattle.

WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Office of HIV/AIDS Housing announced it will award more than $13 million in Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH) Renewal and Replacement Grants, which assist with tenant based rental assistance, supportive services, and other housing activities. This is the second of two rounds of grant announcements.
Research shows that a stable home is critical to the well-being of persons living with HIV/AIDS, and results in better health outcomes and reduced transmission of the disease. In addition to housing assistance, these local programs will provide access to supportive services such as case management, mental health services, substance abuse services, and employment training. The combination of housing assistance and supportive services are critical in sustaining housing stability, promoting better health outcomes, and increasing quality of life, which promotes self-sufficiency efforts for those able to transition to the private housing market.
Since 1992, HUD's HOPWA Program has provided national leadership and resources that support the development and operation of high-quality supportive housing programs. Under the HOPWA Program, HUD makes grants to cities, states, and nonprofit organizations to provide housing assistance and supportive services to low-income persons living with HIV/AIDS and their families. By providing assistance with housing and related services, the HOPWA program helps persons living with HIV/AIDS enter into housing, access and remain in medical care, and adhere to complex treatment regimens.

12/15/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-252.cfm,FHA Announces New Assistance Option to Help Senior Homeowners with Reverse Mortgages Impacted by COVID-19,"New COVID-19 Home Equity Conversion Mortgage Property Charge Repayment Plan allows servicers to offer homeowners up to five years to repay past-due property charges.
WASHINGTON - Today, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) is announcing new flexibilities to help senior homeowners with FHA-insured Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECMs) who are behind on required property charge payments due to effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The new COVID-19 HECM Property Charge Repayment Plan allows mortgage servicers to offer eligible homeowners up to five years to repay property charges, such as taxes and homeowners insurance, that the servicer advances on the homeowner's behalf when the homeowner is unable to make these payments.
""For senior homeowners, recovering from the financial effects of the pandemic may be especially challenging,"" said Federal Housing Commissioner Julia Gordon. ""The new repayment plan option announced today will give more seniors behind on their property charges the opportunity to fulfill the obligations of their HECM and remain in their homes.""
With the new COVID-19 HECM Property Charge Repayment Plan:
Borrowers may receive a repayment plan regardless of the dollar amount of property charge payments owed. Borrowers can benefit from the use of jurisdictional Homeowner Assistance Funds. Servicers can offer homeowners a repayment plan of up to five full years (60 months) regardless of any prior repayment plan usage. Servicers can offer the COVID-19 HECM Property Charge Repayment Plan for up to one year after the end of the COVID-19 National Emergency.
• Borrowers may receive a repayment plan regardless of the dollar amount of property charge payments owed.
• Borrowers can benefit from the use of jurisdictional Homeowner Assistance Funds.
• Servicers can offer homeowners a repayment plan of up to five full years (60 months) regardless of any prior repayment plan usage.
• Servicers can offer the COVID-19 HECM Property Charge Repayment Plan for up to one year after the end of the COVID-19 National Emergency.
To be eligible, borrowers must attest that they have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which can be a verbal statement to the servicer.
About HECM Property Charge Payments
Homeowners are required to pay property charges as a condition of their HECM. If they are unable to maintain these payments, they are considered in default and their mortgage servicer must advance funds to pay the property charges. Failure to resolve a property charge default can result in foreclosure. To remedy the default, servicers may offer homeowners a repayment plan to repay the advances made by the servicer. FHA's standard HECM property charge repayment policy only permits 60 months in total to repay property charge advances."
12/19/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-253.cfm,HUD Releases 2022 Annual Homeless Assessment Report,"Biden-Harris Administration investments and actions prevented a spike in homelessness overall, and led to decreases in homelessness among Veterans, families, and youth
Homelessness rose for individuals, people with disabilities who experience long-term homelessness, and people in unsheltered settings
WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today released its 2022 Annual Homeless Assessment Report (AHAR) Part 1 to Congress (https://huduser.gov/portal/datasets/ahar/2022-ahar-part-1-pit-estimates-of-homelessness-in-the-us.html). The report found 582,462 people were experiencing homelessness on a single night in January 2022. COVID-19 and its economic impacts could have led to significant increases in homelessness, however investments, partnerships and government agency outreach resulted in only a .3% increase in the number of people experiencing homelessness from 2020 to 2022. The Biden-Harris Administration intends to not only stop but reverse the post-2016 trend of rising homelessness and reduce it 25% by 2025, as stated in All In, The Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness (www.usich.gov/news/after-halting-rapid-rise-in-homelessness-biden-harris-administration-announces-plan-to-reduce-homelessness-25-by-2025), which was released today by the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness. Compared with 2020, homelessness among people in shelters declined by 1.6%, while homelessness among people in unsheltered settings increased by 3.4%. The rate of overall homelessness due in large part to a robust federal response that prevented evictions through Emergency Rental Assistance distributed to more than three million households, expanded resources for vulnerable families through the Child Tax Credit and provided other financial transfers through stimulus.
Homelessness among certain sub-populations decreased. The number of veterans experiencing homelessness decreased by 11%, contributing to a 55% decrease since 2010. Between 2020 and 2022, the number of families with children experiencing homelessness declined by 6% between 2020 and 2022, marking a total decline of 36% since 2010. The number of people under the age of 25 who experienced homelessness on their own as ""unaccompanied youth"" also declined by 12%.
""HUD and everyone in the Biden-Harris Administration is committed to ensuring every person has a safe, stable place to call home. Data shows that homelessness remains a national crisis, but it also shows that the historic investments this Administration has made to address this issue, can work,"" said U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""The Biden-Harris Administration is working to significantly reduce homelessness across the country and combat the racial and ethnic disparities resulting from systemic racism.""
While the overall number of people experiencing homelessness in 2022 increased slightly compared with 2020, it rose significantly for individuals, people with disabilities who experience long-term homelessness, and people in unsheltered settings. Single individuals not part of family households continue to represent the largest group of people experiencing homelessness. Homelessness among single individuals increased by 3.1%. The number of chronically homeless individuals (individuals with disabilities experiencing homelessness for long periods of time) increased by 16% between 2020 and 2022.
People who identify as Black, African American, or African, as well as indigenous people (including Native Americans and Pacific Islanders) continue to be overrepresented among those experiencing homelessness.
The AHAR data reflects a single-night snapshot of homelessness in America in early 2022 and the first complete single-night count of people experiencing homelessness since the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic. It shows that overall homelessness remained relatively unchanged despite the economic challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic.
These results, however, do not reflect the full impact of the Biden-Harris Administration's American Rescue Plan and HUD's House America initiative, which largely took place during calendar year 2022. For instance, the majority of HUD's Emergency Housing Voucher program lease-ups took place during 2022. Also, during 2022, HUD released a first-of-its-kind Initiative to Address Unsheltered and Rural Homelessness, which HUD plans to award in early 2023.
HUD releases the AHAR to Congress in two parts. Part 1 provides Point-in-Time (PIT) estimates, offering a snapshot of homelessness on a single night. The one-night counts are conducted during the last 10 days of January each year, with extensions approved on a case-by-case basis. The PIT counts also provide an estimate of the number of people experiencing homelessness within particular homeless populations such as individuals with chronic patterns of homelessness and veterans experiencing homelessness.
The 2022 report provides comparisons with 2020 data because many communities were considerably impacted by COVID-19 during the 2021 PIT count and did not conduct an unsheltered PIT count. The 2020 PIT estimate included both sheltered and unsheltered homelessness. In addition, the report compares 2022 data to data from 2010, the first year that the federal government set a national goal to end homelessness.

Today, the Biden-Harris administration released a federal plan for ending homelessness in America that starts with the ambitious goal of reducing homelessness 25% by 2025. All In: The Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness builds on the success of previous plans and will do more than any previous federal effort to systemically prevent homelessness and combat the systemic racism that has created racial and ethnic disparities in homelessness.
Click to read All In: The Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness (www.usich.gov/sites/default/files/document/All_In.pdf). ""My plan offers a roadmap for not only getting people into housing but also ensuring that they have access to the support, services, and income that allow them to thrive,"" said President Biden. ""It is a plan that is grounded in the best evidence and aims to improve equity and strengthen collaboration at all levels.""
President Biden encourages state and local governments to use All In, which was developed by the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH), as a blueprint for creating their own plans to prevent and end homelessness and setting their own ambitious goals for 2025.
All In recommits the federal government to strategies that have been proven to work, like ""Housing First""-the model of care that treats housing as the immediate solution to homelessness, but not the only solution. Once housed, many people need support to stay housed-from health care and job training to legal and education assistance. This model works because it treats people with dignity, personalizes their care, and recognizes that-without housing-every other aspect of a person's life suffers.
The release of the plan coincides with the week of Homeless Person's Memorial Day, which commemorates the people who have lost their life while living without a home. People who experience homelessness die nearly 30 years earlier than the average American and at the average age that Americans died in 1900. All In responds to homelessness like a life-and-death crisis rooted in housing and health problems-not a crime for the justice system to solve.
While homelessness is deadly, it is also preventable. The pandemic proved the power of prevention: The Biden-Harris administration's response to COVID-including emergency rental assistance for people at risk of eviction and direct cash assistance for most Americans-prevented millions from losing their homes and kept evictions at pre-pandemic levels. All In aims to further fix systems and failed policies in order to prevent homelessness, or the risk of it, long before it happens.
All In was built from the ground up and shaped by public input from more than 500 people who have experienced homelessness as well as leaders, providers, advocates, developers, and other partners from more than 600 communities, tribes, and territories. The plan is based on more than 1,500 online comments and more than 80 listening sessions that told USICH the federal government needs to:
Urgently address the basic needs of people in crisis; Expand the supply of and access to affordable housing and high-quality support; Build better systems to prevent people from losing their home in the first place; Collaborate across sectors, systems, and jurisdictions; Rely on data and evidence that show what works; and Include people who have experienced homelessness in the policymaking process to dismantle systems that create disparities.
• Urgently address the basic needs of people in crisis;
• Expand the supply of and access to affordable housing and high-quality support;
• Build better systems to prevent people from losing their home in the first place;
• Collaborate across sectors, systems, and jurisdictions;
• Rely on data and evidence that show what works; and
• Include people who have experienced homelessness in the policymaking process to dismantle systems that create disparities.
""Nobody-no veteran, no American-should experience homelessness in the greatest country in the world,"" said Veterans Affairs Secretary Denis McDonough, the chair of USICH, which developed All In with 19 federal agencies. ""Together, we've driven down veteran homelessness by 55% since 2010, showing that we know how to tackle this issue if we all work together. Under President Biden's leadership, we are going to build on that momentum and drive toward the day when every American has a good, safe place to call home.""
After the Obama-Biden administration released and implemented the nation's first federal strategic plan to prevent and end homelessness, homelessness steadily and significantly dropped from 2010 to 2016. Since 2016, homelessness has been on the rise. But after two years of unprecedented federal investment, the Biden-Harris administration has begun to halt the rapid rise and now has a plan to reduce homelessness 25% by 2025. According to the 2022 Annual Homelessness Assessment Report (AHAR)-which reveals the pandemic's impact on homelessness and was released today by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)-582,462 people were experiencing homelessness on a single night in January. That represents an increase of 2,034 people-less than 1% since before the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020.

""Everyone deserves a safe and stable place to call home. After years of steep rises in homelessness and amid historic challenges that included a global pandemic, the data shows that we can make progress even under the most difficult circumstances,"" said HUD Secretary Marcia Fudge, who served as chair of USICH during the development of All In. ""We have a long way to go with systems to fix however the Biden-Harris administration's historic investments represent our commitment to addressing homelessness and the underlying racial inequities. All In is our action plan to speed up the progress.""
In the last two years, the Biden-Harris administration has made unprecedented efforts to end homelessness, which include the White House Housing Supply Action Plan (www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/16/president-biden-announces-new-actions-to-ease-the-burden-of-housing-costs/) that aims to close the housing supply gap in 5 years; the American Rescue Plan Act (www.usich.gov/sites/default/files/document/USICH_American_Rescue_Plan_Guide.pdf) that President Biden signed to deliver one of the largest investments in ending homelessness in U.S. history; and the House America initiative that is on track to find permanent housing for more than 100,000 people experiencing homelessness and add more than 20,000 units of affordable housing into the pipeline by the end of this month.
Although overall homelessness remained flat from January 2020 to January 2022, unsheltered homelessness-which includes people living in cars and tents-rose by 3%. As homelessness has become more visible, there has been a troubling rise in state and local laws that criminalize and exacerbate homelessness by making it illegal for people without a home to do certain activities in public that are otherwise legal in the setting of a home: sleeping, sitting, eating. All In serves as a more effective alternative to criminalization.
Today, USICH and the White House also announced a new initiative to help cities and states reduce unsheltered homelessness. The 19 federal agencies that make up USICH will work with select state and local governments to accelerate the implementation and effectiveness of strategies to get people off the streets and into homes.

""Housing should be treated as a human right,"" said USICH Executive Director Jeff Olivet. ""Many Americans ask, 'Is it possible to end homelessness?' The answer is, yes, the United States can end homelessness by fixing systems-not by blaming the people being failed by them. With All In, the Biden-Harris administration outlined a set of strategies and actions for doing just that. Now we must scale what works and develop new and creative solutions to build a future where no one experiences the tragedy and indignity of homelessness-and everyone has a safe, stable, accessible, and affordable home.""
""The evidence shows that stable housing is essential to health and well-being. Like many health conditions, homelessness is preventable, and I am proud to be part of an administration that acknowledges the power of prevention,"" said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra, who serves as vice chair of USICH.
USICH will host webinars in 2023-starting in January-to help partners and communities use All In to develop local and systems-levels plans to prevent and end homelessness, set state and local goals to reduce homelessness by 2025, hold the federal government accountable, and learn more about federal programs, strategies, and actions to prevent and end homelessness.

12/20/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-255.cfm,HUD Seeking First-of-Its-Kind Public Input to More Equitably and Accurately Allocate Disaster Recovery Funds,"Two new Requests for Information (RFIs) to mark inaugural feedback effort for Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) funds
WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today released two new Requests for Information (RFIs), marking the first time the Department has asked the public for feedback on how to simplify, modernize, and more equitably distribute critical disaster recovery funds: Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR (www.hudexchange.info/programs/cdbg-dr/)) and Mitigation (CDBG-MIT (www.hudexchange.info/programs/cdbg-mit/)). This move is a broader element of HUD's newly published Climate Action Plan, which emphasizes both equity and resilience in disaster recovery, as well as the Biden-Harris Administration's commitment to strengthening low- and moderate-income communities.
""Having visited the damage of Hurricanes Ian and Ida (www.wafb.com/2021/09/18/hud-secretary-marcia-fudge-tours-new-orleans-area-hurricane-damage/), I have seen firsthand how weather-related disasters harm communities unequally,"" said Marcia L. Fudge, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). ""Here at HUD, we know that investing in equity and resilience presents us an opportunity to meet our climate goals and build more stable, diverse, and inclusive communities with quality affordable homes for all. These RFIs are the next step in our process to ensure recovery resources can be delivered more efficiently and equitably in the future.""
""Through CDBG-DR funding, we can provide critical support to disaster recovery survivors who need it most,"" said Marion Mollegen McFadden, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development. ""Only HUD offers disaster resources that prioritize the needs of people of modest means. Unfortunately, the one-off appropriation process delays local access to these funds by months, confusing grantees, producing unnecessary barriers to participation in recovery programs, and thus dulling the effects of our efforts. It's time we right these wrongs by streamlining how these funds are disseminated - while doubling down on our responsibility to ensure equitable outcomes.""
""The first step in strengthening the CDBG-DR program is, for the very first time, seeking feedback on what data and information HUD should use in assessing the need for assistance and making funding available,"" said Solomon Greene, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research, said. ""I am proud that the Biden-Harris Administration is asking the public to share thoughts with us. Other HUD programs benefit from public comments, and I expect that recommendations in response to this RFI will inform how HUD makes future allocations.""
CDBG-DR and CDBG-MIT funds focus on long-term recovery and resilience efforts, targeted to families with low- and moderate-incomes in the most impacted and distressed areas. Through CDBG-DR (https://files.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/CDBG-DR-Fact-Sheet.pdf), HUD spends billions of dollars helping communities recover from the most devastating disasters. CDBG-DR and CDBG-MIT funds are unique from other Federal disaster assistance programs administered by FEMA and the SBA, as well as private insurance, as the only federal resource with the primary purpose of benefitting low- and moderate-income communities.
But despite their importance, there is no regular annual appropriation for CDBG-DR and statutory authority is provided through each appropriation. This means HUD must customize grant requirements for each disaster through Federal Register notices, resulting in delays in disbursal of funds, lack of standardization and consistency, and the need for grantees to manage multiple grants with different rules. HUD estimates that it takes 1.5 years from the time of disaster until the first CDBG-DR dollar is spent on physical housing recovery. These RFIs will inform the policy that will tear down barriers and eliminate unnecessary administrative burden, as to provide better and quicker assistance to those affected.
HUD's Climate Action Plan notes that the Department is committed to advancing the goals of Executive Order 13985, which requires that HUD allocate resources in a manner that addresses the historic failure of the Federal government to invest sufficiently, justly, and equally in underserved communities, particularly communities of color. These RFIs are a result of both this long-term strategy and the greater efforts of the Biden-Harris administration to prioritize an equitable and methodical response to Presidentially-declared natural disasters.
In another example of the Biden-Harris Administration's effort to hasten and modernize disaster response, Secretary Fudge announced the first round of funding allocations through the new Rapid Unsheltered Survivor Housing (RUSH) program this October. These funds address homelessness by filling in federal assistance gaps in communities hit by disasters. The first round of funding consisted of $6.8 million to the State of Florida and seven of the state's localities impacted by Hurricane Ian.

WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) awarded $25.4 million in HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) vouchers to 99 Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) across the country. This award will help homeless Veterans and their families find and sustain permanent housing.
The HUD-VASH program provides housing and an array of supportive services to veterans experiencing homelessness by combining rental assistance from HUD with case management and clinical services provided by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Thanks to the joint efforts of HUD, VA, and United States Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH), the number of Veterans experiencing homelessness has fallen by 11% since early 2020 - the biggest decline in more than 5 years.
""We've made significant strides reducing the number of Veterans experiencing homelessness and these investments will build on that progress,"" said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""The Biden-Harris Administration has made ending homelessness a top priority. Today's announcement puts us one step closer to ensuring every Veteran who serves our country has safe, stable housing.""
Provided through the HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) Program, this supportive housing assistance combines rental assistance from HUD with case management and clinical services provided by the VA. This round of allocations will support 2308 HUD-VASH vouchers, and a breakdown of the awards by recipient is available on HUD's website.
""No Veteran should experience homelessness in this country they fought to defend,"" said VA Secretary Denis McDonough. ""These HUD-VASH vouchers will help more than 2,300 Veterans find good homes and stay in those homes, where they belong - and there's nothing more important than that.""
This calendar year, VA has provided more than 34,000 permanent housing placements for homeless Veterans - putting VA on track to meet, and even exceed, its goal of 38,000 permanent housing placements for homeless Veterans in 2022 (www.va.gov/opa/pressrel/pressrelease.cfm?id=5767).
Since 2008, Congress has appropriated a total of $885 million for new HUD-VASH vouchers, and billions more to renew these vouchers every year. To date, nearly 107,000 HUD-VASH vouchers (106,989) have been awarded to Public Housing Authorities and VA Medical Center (PHA/VAMC) partnerships. Approximately 700 PHAs nationwide administer HUD-VASH vouchers."

The loan guarantee, offered through the Section 108 Loan Guarantee Program (Section 108), will be used to finance the extension of sanitary sewer lines to a 400-acre site that is proposed for new development in the Corbet Industrial Park. Though two businesses already operate in the park, they currently rely on temporary sewage disposal facilities, which are not sustainable and could deter or limit the growth of business. This project will benefit people with low- and moderate-incomes (LMI) by creating job opportunities. The loan requires that at least 51 percent of the full-time equivalent jobs are held by or made available to people with low and moderate incomes.
""Stable infrastructure is a key component in supporting economic development in low-income communities,"" said Marion McFadden, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary, Office of Community Planning and Development at HUD. ""This loan guarantee will support the Sandy Township in its pursuit to generate jobs for low-income individuals and set the stage to attract future commercial endeavors. Having the Commonwealth's support for this infrastructure project will ensure growth and give this community a competitive edge. This loan guarantee is a good example of how HUD provides states with a potent investment tool to support infrastructure in smaller communities"".
Section 108 provides Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds to states and communities as a source of low-cost, long-term financing for economic and community development projects that primarily benefit low- and moderate-income persons. Section 108 can be used for a variety of projects, such as housing, infrastructure, and other physical development projects. The flexibility of the program makes it an attractive and effective tool for states and local governments."

WASHINGTON - Today, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Marcia L. Fudge announced $4,409,000 in Choice Neighborhoods Planning Grants to nine communities across America. These grants of up to $500,000 each will bring together community partners to create comprehensive neighborhood revitalization plans to redevelop severely distressed HUD-assisted housing, improve outcomes for residents, and bring new amenities to high-poverty neighborhoods.
The grants will go to communities of all sizes from small cities, such as Salem, NJ with a population of just under 5,000, to large urban centers like Washington, DC. HUD has named Washington, DC, Steubenville, OH, Lorain, OH, Salem, NJ, New Orleans, LA, Harrisburg, PA, Goldsboro, NC, Fort Wayne, IN, and Flint, MI as this year's recipients. See listing of specific organizations and funding amounts below.
""Choice Neighborhoods grants are unlike any other - they are not just an investment in homes, they are an investment into entire communities,"" said Secretary Fudge. ""I look forward to seeing how the nine new Choice Neighborhoods communities use these grants to improve outcomes for education, health care, the economy, and overall quality of life for residents. These funds will make a real change for the people we serve, building safer, healthier communities for all.""
Choice Neighborhoods supports the revitalization of communities through an emphasis on creating mixed-income housing and linking those housing investments with effective services for residents and physical neighborhood improvements. Through Planning Grants, local leaders, residents, and stakeholders, such as public housing authorities, cities, schools, police, business owners, nonprofits, and private developers, come together to create a community-driven ""Transformation Plan"" that address these ""Housing, People, and Neighborhood"" goals.
Since its founding, the Choice Neighborhoods program, along with the private and public leverage it attracts, has collectively invested more than $5 billion into historically disinvested communities.

12/23/2022:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2022/pr22-259.cfm,HUD and Census Bureau Report New Residential Sales in November 2022,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Census Bureau jointly announced the following new residential sales statistics for November 2022:

New Home Sales
Sales of new single family houses in November 2022 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 640,000, according to estimates released jointly today by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. This is 5.8 percent (±22.7 percent)* above the revised October rate of 605,000, but is 15.3 percent (±13.0 percent) below the November 2021 estimate of 756,000.
Sales Price The median sales price of new houses sold in November 2022 was $471,200. The average sales price was $543,600.
For Sale Inventory and Months' Supply The seasonally-adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of November was 461,000. This represents a supply of 8.6 months at the current sales rate. The December report is scheduled for release on January 26, 2023. View the full schedule in the Economic Briefing Room (www.census.gov/construction/soc/schedule.html).

EXPLANATORY NOTES
These statistics are estimated from sample surveys. They are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated average relative standard errors of the preliminary data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. Changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show irregular movement. It takes 4 months to establish a trend for new houses sold. Preliminary new home sales figures are subject to revision due to the survey methodology and definitions used. The survey is primarily based on a sample of houses selected from building permits. Since a ""sale"" is defined as a deposit taken or sales agreement signed, this can occur prior to a permit being issued. An estimate of these prior sales is included in the sales figure. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimate of total sales is revised about 5.8 percent. Changes in sales price data reflect changes in the distribution of houses by region, size, etc., as well as changes in the prices of houses with identical characteristics.

WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today awarded over $9 million to 4 Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) to help families increase their earned income and improve their economic mobility through the Jobs Plus program.
Jobs Plus grants support work readiness and connect public housing residents with employment, education, and financial empowerment services -part of an evidence-based model proven to help public housing residents find and keep jobs. Read more about how these PHAs will put their grant funds to work. This program also supports HUD's Bridging the Wealth Gap agenda which pursues economic justice and asset building for renters.
""HUD is committed to lifting individuals and families up by focusing on the multifaceted issues around poverty,"" said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge, ""Through training, employment, and financial and community support, we are setting people up to be successful for the long term. As we all know, upward mobility is crucial to a better quality of life and that's what makes the Jobs Plus program so powerful. We are giving families what they need to be completely self-sufficient in every way.""
The approach of the Jobs Plus program is one that combines traditional employment, training, and job placement services with a rent incentive and a place-based investment in building community support for work. The program requires PHAs to partner locally with Department of Labor Workforce Development Boards and American Jobs Centers. Additionally, Jobs Plus grantees are required to demonstrate a 25 percent match from community partners, providing wrap-around supportive services to improve employment and earnings outcomes. Cross-agency partnerships are essential to changing the economic prospects of public housing residents. The Jobs Plus program's place-based model helps residents support each other through the process, cultivating a culture of work and enhancing economic resiliency.
Though the fundamentals of the program have not changed with this year's funding cycle, the program has seen some welcomed changes. Many of the changes bring further clarification to key components of the program, but they also include the allowance of PHAs to meet eligibility with smaller populations of work-able adults than before. Program changes now also require that applicants meet with program leadership to discuss implementation, feasibility, and impact.
The following public housing authorities are receiving funding:"
