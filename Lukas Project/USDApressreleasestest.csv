19-Jan-21,/media/press-releases/2021/01/19/secretary-perdue-statement-mou-animal-biotechnology,Secretary Perdue Statement on MOU on Animal Biotechnology,"(Washington, D.C., January 19, 2021)
 – U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue issued the following statement after signing a 
Memorandum of Understanding
 (PDF, 141 KB) with the Assistant Secretary for Health and Head of the Public Health Service Admiral Brett Giroir, M.D., establishing a regulatory environment at the Department of Agriculture for agricultural animal biotechnology innovation:


“Today’s Memorandum of Understanding clears a path to bring our regulatory framework into the 21
st
 century, putting American producers on a level playing field with their competitors around the world. In the past, regulations stifled innovation, causing American businesses to play catch-up and cede market share,” 
said Secretary Perdue
. “America has the safest and most affordable food supply in the entire world thanks to the innovation of our farmers, ranchers and producers. Establishing a new, transparent, risk and science-based regulatory framework would ensure this continues to be the case.”


Background:


Today, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced the finalization of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Food and Drug Administration (FDA) outlining responsibilities concerning the regulation of certain animals developed using genetic engineering that are intended for agricultural purposes (such as human food, fiber, and labor). This MOU complements USDA’s issuance of an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR) on the Movement of Animals Modified or Developed by Genetic Engineering on December 28, 2020.


Agricultural biotechnology holds tremendous potential to improve animal health, enhance farm productivity, improve nutrition, and even reduce the need for some animal health measures. USDA and FDA have a long history of delineating the review of products with overlapping jurisdictional authority between the two agencies to promote regulatory clarity and reduce duplicative review. USDA and FDA are committed to working together to foster safe use of this promising technology and encourage innovation.


The terms of the MOU support USDA’s ANPR outlining a contemplated regulatory framework that would apply to certain animals (cattle, sheep, goats, swine, horses, mules, or other equines, catfish, and poultry) developed using genetic engineering intended for agricultural purposes. Under this framework, USDA would safeguard animal and human health by providing end-to-end oversight from pre-market reviews through post-market food safety monitoring for certain farm animals modified or developed using genetic engineering that are intended for human food.


The MOU also allows for the transition of portions of FDA’s pre-existing animal biotechnology regulatory oversight to USDA. USDA would continue to coordinate closely with FDA to fulfill oversight responsibilities and provide the appropriate regulatory environment, ensuring the safety of products derived from new technologies and fostering innovation at the same time. As always, FDA would continue its review of intentional genomic alterations intended for any purpose other than agricultural use, such as biopharma and non-heritable genomic alteration, and the regulation of dairy products, table and shell eggs, certain meat products, and animal food (feed) derived from animals developed using genetic engineering.

15-Jan-21,/media/press-releases/2021/01/15/secretary-perdue-statement-h-2a-modernization,Secretary Perdue Statement on H-2A Modernization,"(Washington, D.C., January 15, 2021)
 - U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue today issued a statement applauding the Department of Labor’s final rule modernizing the H-2A visa program:


“This final rule streamlining and modernizing the H-2A visa process will go a long way in ensuring American farmers have access to a stable and skilled workforce, all while removing unnecessary bureaucratic processes. USDA’s goal is to help farmers navigate the complex H-2A program that is administered by Department of Labor, Department of Homeland Security, and the State Department so hiring a farm worker is an easier process,” said Secretary Perdue. “These modernizations make the Federal government more responsive to our customers, ensuring American agriculture continues to lead the world for years to come.”


Background:


The final rule will streamline the H-2A application process by mandating electronic filing of job orders and applications. These elements are designed to bring the H-2A application process into the digital era, by harnessing the power of the FLAG electronic filing system to share information with other federal agencies like the Department of Homeland Security while also sharing information with the State Workforce systems and domestic farmworkers.


Additionally, the final rule will provide additional flexibilities to cut down on unnecessary burdens on the agricultural employers that use the program. These flexibilities include the ability to stagger the entry of workers into the country over a 120-day period and allowing agricultural employers the flexibility to file a single application for different dates of need instead of multiple applications.

15-Jan-21,/media/press-releases/2021/01/15/usda-offers-additional-assistance-certain-producers-through,USDA Offers Additional Assistance for Certain Producers Through Coronavirus Food Assistance Program,"(Washington, D.C., January 15, 2021)
 – U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue announced the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) will provide additional assistance through the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP), expanding eligibility for some agricultural producers and commodities as well as updating payments to accurately compensate some producers who already applied for the program. Producers who are now eligible and those who need to modify existing applications due to these updates can contact USDA’s Farm Service Agency (FSA) between Jan. 19 and Feb. 26. Some of these changes are being made to align with the recently enacted Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 while others are discretionary changes being made in response to ongoing evaluation of CFAP.


“The COVID-19 pandemic has left a deep impact on the farm economy, and we are utilizing the tools and monies available to ease some of the financial burdens on American producers to ensure our agricultural economy remains strong, independent and a global leader in production,” said Secretary Perdue. “As part of implementing CFAP 1 and CFAP 2, we identified new areas of support and Congress recently directed us to provide additional relief. This additional assistance builds on to the $23.6 billion in assistance already provided to our farmers and ranchers impacted by the pandemic, and we will continue to implement other provisions enacted by Congress.”


Background:


Expanded Eligibility for CFAP 2


Contract producers of swine, broilers, laying hens, chicken eggs and turkeys who suffered a drop in revenue in 2020 as compared to their 2019 revenue because of the pandemic now are eligible for assistance. Producers could receive up to 80% of their revenue loss, subject to the availability of funds.


Producers of pullets and turfgrass sod also now are eligible for CFAP payments. The commodities were not explicitly included in the initial CFAP 2 rule. Payments are based on eligible sales, and the payment calculation in the updated rule includes crop insurance indemnities, Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP), and Wildfire and Hurricane Indemnity Program – Plus (WHIP+) payments.


Updated Payment Calculations for CFAP 2


Similarly, FSA adjusted the payment calculation to use the producer’s eligible 2019 calendar year sales, and 2019 crop insurance indemnities, NAP, and WHIP+ payments, multiplied by the applicable payment rate for all sales commodities, which include specialty crops, aquaculture, tobacco, specialty livestock, nursery crops and floriculture, for CFAP 2. Producers who applied during the sign-up period that closed Dec. 11, 2020, can modify an existing CFAP 2 application between Jan. 19 and Feb. 26, 2021.


Additionally, FSA adjusted the payment calculation for certain row crops for CFAP 2, specifically those for which a producer had crop insurance coverage but not an available 2020 Actual Production History (APH) approved yield. FSA is now using 100% of the 2019 Agriculture Risk Coverage-County Option (ARC-CO) benchmark yield to calculate payments when an APH is not available rather than 85%, which was in the original CFAP 2 calculations. This calculation change is only for producers with crop insurance coverage who grow barley, corn, sorghum, soybeans, sunflowers, upland cotton and wheat. Producers who applied during the sign-up period that closed Dec. 11, 2020, can modify an existing CFAP 2 application between Jan. 19 and Feb. 26, 2021.


CFAP 1 ‘Top-up’ Payments for Swine


FSA is providing an additional CFAP 1 inventory payment for swine to help producers who face continuing market disruptions from changes in U.S. meat consumption due to the pandemic. Swine producers with approved CFAP 1 applications will soon automatically receive a “top-up” payment of $17 per head increasing the total CFAP1 inventory payment to $34 per head.


More Information


Newly eligible producers who need to submit a CFAP 2 application or producers who need to modify an existing one can do so between Jan. 19 and Feb. 26, 2021, by contacting their local USDA Service Center. New applicants can also obtain one-on-one support with applications by calling 877-508-8364.


In addition to the changes being made to CFAP, per language in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021, FSA will extend 2020 Marketing Assistance Loans to provide additional flexibilities for farmers. FSA is also preparing to move forward on implementation of the remaining provisions of the recently passed Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021.

14-Jan-21,/media/press-releases/2021/01/14/secretary-perdue-statement-establishment-wildland-fire-subcabinet,Secretary Perdue Statement on the Establishment of Wildland Fire Subcabinet,"(Washington, D.C., January 14, 2021)
 – U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue today issued a statement celebrating the establishment of the Interagency Wildland Fire Subcabinet. Executive Order on Establishing The Wildland Fire Management Policy Committee will open up more communication channels to ensure better forest management effectiveness between the Departments and Agencies within the Federal government.


“While I am proud of our progress to promote active management, reduce hazardous fuels, work across boundaries and increase the resiliency of our nation’s forests and grasslands, I believe more can be done,” said Secretary Perdue. “With the establishment of a subcabinet dedicated exclusively to wildland fire management, we will be better equipped to prevent and fight wildfires, ensuring these national treasures will continue to be enjoyed by future generations of Americans.”


Background:


Executive Order on Establishing The Wildland Fire Management Policy Committee will set United States policy to:




Improve coordination among agencies on wildland fire management policy, implementation and oversight issues;


Reduce unnecessary duplication across the Federal Government by coordinating and consolidating existing wildland fire related councils, working groups, and other formal cross-agency initiatives, as appropriate;


Efficiently and effectively manage preparedness resources, initial attack response, extended attack and large fire support, and hazardous fuels at a cross boundary, landscape scale;


Promote integrated planning and procurement among agencies for Federal investments in wildland fire management infrastructure; and


Support workforce development and efforts to recruit, train, and retain federal wildland firefighters to efficiently and effectively respond to wildfire on public lands, and to protect life, property and community infrastructure.

12-Jan-21,/media/press-releases/2021/01/12/usda-releases-agriculture-innovation-research-strategy-summary-and,USDA Releases Agriculture Innovation Research Strategy Summary and Dashboard,"(Washington, D.C., January 12, 2021)
 – Today, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) released its 
U.S. Agriculture Innovation Strategy Directional Vision for Research
 (PDF, 4.8 MB) summary and 
dashboard
 that will help to guide future research decisions within USDA. The strategy synthesizes the information USDA collected as part of a public announcement earlier this year engaging the public on research priorities under the 
Agriculture Innovation Agenda (AIA)
.


“This initial report is a culmination of creative minds from across the agricultural community,” said Deputy Under Secretary Scott Hutchins, who leads USDA’s Research, Education, and Economics mission area, and who is responsible for research efforts under the AIA. “Innovation and ingenuity have always been key to solving critical agricultural production challenges and will also be critical for addressing new and emerging challenges on the horizon—and our stakeholders advocated for some truly bold goals. We believe this information and the AIA will create enthusiasm, bridge collaborations, drive constructive discussions, and spark imagination to convey the positive role innovation will play to help solve challenges that face our nation in meeting pressing demands to feed a growing population in a sustainable way,” said Hutchins.


USDA collected hundreds of responses through the RFI and stakeholder-led workshops. Respondents were asked to identify transformational research goals for the next era of agriculture productivity and environmental conservation. They were also asked to propose approaches to these opportunities around four innovation cluster areas (Genome Design, Digital Automation, Prescriptive Intervention, and Systems Based Farm Management), and to identify gaps, barriers, and hurdles to meeting these goals.


This report summarizes the extensive stakeholder input and defines discovery goals that will help inform research to best address the AIA for the next 10 to 30 years.


USDA developed the 
public dashboard
 to help sort the information collected from stakeholders. Stakeholders and customers can use the dashboard to take a deeper dive into the data to gain insights on agricultural innovation opportunities over three time horizons, including near-term solutions, longer-term transformational solutions, and next era concepts.


Both products are iterative and are starting points for moving the innovation community forward in reaching agricultural research goals and AIA outcomes. USDA will seek additional input from stakeholders to continue to shape and build the agriculture innovation strategy and fill any remaining gaps where more input is needed. Next steps include aligning existing USDA research programs against these bold innovation goals, while also linking existing research activities to the objectives to inform the broader innovation community of progress and enlist their engagement.


Background on USDA’s Agriculture Innovation Agenda (AIA):


The AIA is a Department-wide effort to align USDA’s resources, programs, and research to provide farmers with the tools they need to position American agriculture as a global leader in meeting future food, fiber, fuel, feed, and climate demands. As part of the AIA, USDA set ambitious goals to increase agricultural production by 40 percent, while cutting the environmental footprint of U.S. agriculture in half by 2050.


The AIA is comprised of four main components. The first component is to develop a U.S. Agriculture Innovation Strategy that aligns and synchronizes public and private-sector research. The second component is to align the work of our customer-facing agencies and integrate innovative technologies and practices into USDA programs. The third component is to conduct a review of USDA productivity and conservation data to improve our ability to track progress against our goals. Finally, USDA set benchmarks to hold us accountable.

 – U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue announced the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) will purchase an additional $1.5 billion worth of food for nationwide distribution through the Farmers to Families Food Box Program. In total, USDA has 
distributed more than 132 million food boxes
 in support of American farmers and families affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.


“This new round of Farmers to Families Food Boxes will go a long way in helping American families access nutritious and healthy meals as we recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. Thanks to the President Trump’s leadership, we have helped tens of millions of families and countless farmers with this program,” 
said Secretary Perdue
. “President Trump has committed to helping the American people recover and rebuild and this program helps American families get back on solid ground by ensuring they receive the nutritious food they need during these difficult times.”


“With over 3.3 billion meals distributed to families across this nation, I am proud to share that thanks to the Trump administration’s efforts, the Farmers to Families Food Box Program has an additional $1.5 billion to continue to feed families in need, provide employment and support our small farmers. During these unprecedented times, this Administration will continue to fight for American families and will always put them first!” - 
Advisor to the President Ivanka Trump


Background:


The additional funding for the program was included in the COVID-19 relief package as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act passed December 21, 2020. In this fifth round of purchases, USDA will again purchase combination boxes to ensure all involved recipient organizations have access to fresh produce, dairy products, fluid milk and meat products, and seafood products will also be included in this round.


The solicitation will be issued to over 240 organizations that have previously received Basic Ordering Agreements (BOA). Solicitations to existing BOA holders are expected to be issued by the end of the week, with contract awards expected to be made by January 19. Deliveries will begin shortly after awards are issued and continue through the end of April. Additional BOA proposals will not be reviewed nor accepted at this time. A complete list of BOA holders can be found at 
www.ams.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media/RoundFourBOAHolders.pdf
 (PDF, 180 KB).


An amendment to the BOA will be issued to clarify the amount of acceptable processed meat products, to include seafood products and to clarify certain labelling requirements. Pre-cooked seafood products are now eligible for food box inclusion and can be aggregated with pre-cooked meat (beef, pork, chicken and turkey) products and egg or egg products to meet the existing material description weight requirements. In addition, USDA has emphasized that other hard, semi-firm or semi-soft cheese, for example, Blue, Brick, Colby, Edam, Gorgonzola, Gouda, Gruyere, Monterey, Muenster, Parmesan, Provolone and Romano are acceptable in addition to cheddar and other cheeses specified in the solicitation.


The Farmers to Families Food Box program is part of the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP), which was developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Using authority provided by the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, USDA partnered with national, regional and local distributors, whose workforces were significantly impacted by the closure of restaurants, hotels and other food service businesses, to purchase and distribute agricultural products to Americans in need.


The fourth round of the program was 
announced
 on Oct. 23, 2020, and purchased a total of $463 million worth of food delivered between Nov. 1 through Dec. 31, 2020. The fourth round was funded by an additional $500 million made available through supplemental appropriations provided to the Secretary in the CARES Act.


The third round of the Farmers to Families Food Box program was 
announced
 July 24, 2020, and the 
President announced
 on Aug. 24, 2020, that up to an additional $1 billion was being made available for deliveries through Oct. 31, 2020. USDA announced contracts for the third round on Sept. 17, 2020. By the end of the third round on Oct. 31, USDA purchased more than $3.566 billion worth of food.


In the 
second round
 of purchasing and distribution, which began July 1 and concluded Sep. 18, 2020, USDA purchased more than $1.781 billion of food through extended contracts of select vendors from the first round of the program as well as new contracts focused on Opportunity Zones in order to direct food to reach underserved areas, places where either no boxes have yet been delivered, or where boxes are being delivered but where there is additional need.


The 
first round
 of purchases occurred from May 15 through June 30, 2020 and saw more than 35.5 million boxes delivered in the first 45 days.


Updates to the number of food boxes verified as delivered will continue to be displayed on the USDA’s 
Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) website

4-Jan-21,/media/press-releases/2021/01/04/usda-continues-move-snap-participants-forward,USDA Continues to Move SNAP Participants Forward,"(Washington, D.C., January 4, 2021)
 – The U.S. Department of Agriculture today announced a final rule enhancing employment and training opportunities for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) participants.


SNAP participants have exclusive access to training and support services to help them enter or move up in the workforce through state SNAP Employment and Training (E&T) programs. The final rule makes a wide range of enhancements to these services to empower more SNAP participants to gain the skills, training, or work experience they need to move forward and into work.


“USDA has a long-standing commitment to increasing opportunities for SNAP participants to move towards and into employment. This rule continues USDA’s efforts to connect more SNAP households with the dignity and hope that work provides,” said USDA Deputy Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services Brandon Lipps.


Background:


In March, USDA published the proposed rule, “Employment and Training Opportunities in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.” The rule published today finalizes many of those changes—improving E&T programs by ensuring that states use evidence-based strategies to help participants get the skills local employers need most, by requiring the use of case management services for E&T participants, and by allowing E&T funds to be used for subsidized employment and apprenticeships.


Today’s final rule underscores USDA’s commitment to improving SNAP E&T programs, in partnership with states. Each year, USDA provides more than $100 million for states to operate their E&T programs. In addition, if a state invests its own money or outside funding to improve its SNAP E&T programs, the federal government will reimburse the state for 50 percent of those funds. Beyond funding, USDA efforts to support SNAP E&T include:




Hosting the first ever 
SNAP E&T National Forum.
 The virtual, 
three-day conference
 took place Oct. 13-15 and connected more than 1,500 partners from across the country to share and learn best practices to promote and boost employment among SNAP households through state E&T programs.


Operating 
SNAP to Skills
, which provides states and their partners with coaching and intensive technical support on how to build strong E&T programs. This year, seven states – Oregon, Colorado, Louisiana, Illinois, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island – joined the 22 other states that have participated in SNAP to Skills since the program was launched in 2015.


Providing training, such as the 
SNAP E&T State Institutes and Learning Academies
, to develop expertise in administering SNAP E&T among individuals, partner organizations, and state agencies across the country.


Issuing more than $6.7 million in 
SNAP E&T National Partnership Grants
 in 2020 to help four national nonprofit organizations expand program capacity and develop networks of third-party partners to serve SNAP participants.




USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service administers 15 
nutrition assistance programs
 that leverage American agricultural abundance to ensure children and low-income individuals and families have nutritious food to eat. FNS also co-develops the 
Dietary Guidelines for Americans,
 which provide science-based nutrition recommendations and serve as the cornerstone of federal nutrition policy. Follow us on Twitter at

(Washington, D.C., December 31, 2020)
 – The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) recognizes the achievements of longtime broadcaster Orion “Big O” Samuelson for six decades of contributions to agriculture journalism.


“There’s a saying that today’s news is tomorrow’s history,” said U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue. “Orion Samuelson’s decades of agriculture reporting has helped farmers understand the latest Washington policies and he has also helped all audiences appreciate the importance of agriculture to our communities and to the economy.”


Samuelson is retiring this month after 60 years in agriculture broadcasting with WGN radio in Chicago. There, he covered agriculture and food production, met with U.S. presidents, travelled to dozens of countries, and encountered many foreign dignitaries, all while reporting on the contributions of American agriculture to the U.S. and world economy. Samuelson is a 2003 National Radio Hall of Fame inductee.

31-Dec-20,/media/press-releases/2020/12/31/usda-approves-maine-accept-snap-benefits-online,USDA Approves Maine to Accept SNAP Benefits Online,"(Washington, D.C., December 31, 2020)
 – U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue today announced approval of a request from Maine to provide online purchasing of food to Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) households. This approval will allow Maine to expedite the implementation of online purchasing with currently authorized SNAP online retailers with a target start date to be announced at a later time. Maine’s SNAP participation is more than 144,000 individuals, more than 78,000 households, and totals $204 million annually in federal benefits. This announcement further demonstrates President Trump’s whole of America approach to fighting the coronavirus pandemic by ensuring those affected are fed.


Background:


SNAP online purchasing
 is currently operational in Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. Authorized online retailers include ALDI, Amazon, Carlie C’s, H-E-B, ShopRite, TheFreshGrocer, Walmart, Woods Supermarket, and Wright’s Markets, Inc. Please refer to our 
website
 to see the states in which these retailers are operating. With these states, more than 90% of all households receiving SNAP will have access to online purchasing.


Multiple stakeholders – notably, state agencies, their third-party processor, and any retailers that wish to participate – must work together to implement online purchasing using SNAP benefits. To ease the process, FNS put together a simplified template for states that want to operate online purchasing and provided guidance to interested retailers, which is available online.


USDA continues to provide significant technical assistance to all interested stakeholders to ensure implementation plans are thorough and appropriate preliminary testing is conducted to avoid compromising the state’s entire benefit system. Each state, EBT processor, and retailer presents their own mix of challenges so FNS is providing customer service based on each of their specific needs.


Until states are prepared to operate the pilot, USDA recommends utilizing other options that retailers may already provide, such as Pay at Pick-up (also known as “Click and Collect”), where SNAP cardholders can shop online and then pay for their purchase using their EBT card at pick-up. Grocery pickup is already an option that these retailers offer beyond SNAP so they are already thinking through how they can provide a safe environment to do so with the concerns around social distancing.


During these challenging times, FNS is working hand-in-hand with state program leadership, to provide support and guidance to adapt to the challenges of this public health emergency. FNS is granting states significant program flexibilities and contingencies to best serve program participants across our 15 nutrition assistance programs.

29-Dec-20,/media/press-releases/2020/12/29/make-every-bite-count-usda-hhs-release-dietary-guidelines-americans,"Make Every Bite Count: USDA, HHS Release Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025","(Washington, D.C., December 29, 2020)
 – Nutrition in America took a major step forward today with the publication of Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025. Jointly published by the U.S. Departments of Agriculture (USDA) and Health and Human Services (HHS) every five years, the guidelines provide science-based recommendations designed to foster healthy dietary patterns for Americans of all ages – from birth through older adults. Importantly, this edition expands the guidance, for the first time including recommended healthy dietary patterns for infants and toddlers.


“At USDA and HHS, we work to serve the American people – to help every American thrive and live healthier lives through access to healthy foods and providing nutrition recommendations,” 
said U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue
. “With the release of the dietary guidelines, we have taken the very important step to provide nutrition guidance that can help all Americans lead healthier lives by making every bite count.”


Dietary Guidelines for Americans
 is the nation’s trusted resource for evidence-based nutrition guidance. The guidelines are designed for use by healthcare professionals and policy makers for outreach to the general public and provide the nutritional foundation for federal nutrition programs. The dietary guidelines should not be considered clinical guidelines for the treatment of disease.


“The science tells us that good nutrition leads to better health outcomes, and the new dietary guidelines use the best available evidence to give Americans the information they need to make healthy decisions for themselves and their families,” 
said HHS Secretary Alex Azar
. “USDA and HHS have expanded this edition of the dietary guidelines to provide new guidance for infants, toddlers, and pregnant and breastfeeding women, helping all Americans to improve their health, no matter their age or life stage.”


As always, the new guidelines build on the previous editions and were informed by the scientific report developed by the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, along with comments from the public and input from federal agencies. USDA and HHS thank the committee for their work and dedication over the last fifteen months, providing the departments with a comprehensive scientific review and proposal of overarching recommendations, a highly regarded step of critical importance in dietary guidelines development. USDA and HHS also made transparency a priority in this edition and appreciate the many public comments that were received throughout this process.


Today’s release provides the public with the most up-to-date evidence on dietary behaviors that promote health and may help prevent chronic disease. Steeped in scientific evidence, the key recommendations look similar to those of the past and address two topics that garnered much attention throughout the development of the guidelines – added sugars and alcoholic beverages. Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 carried forward the committee’s emphasis on limiting these dietary components, but did not include changes to quantitative recommendations, as there was 
not a preponderance of evidence
 in the material the committee reviewed to support specific changes, as required by law. As in previous editions, limited intake of these two food components is encouraged. In fact, this sentiment remains prominent throughout the policy document and complements the four overarching guidelines, which encourage Americans to “Make Every Bite Count” by:




Following a healthy dietary pattern at every life stage.


Customizing and enjoying nutrient-dense food and beverage choices to reflect personal preferences, cultural traditions, and budgetary considerations.


Focusing on meeting food group needs with nutrient-dense foods and beverages from five food groups – vegetables, fruits, grains, dairy and fortified soy alternatives, and proteins – and staying within calorie limits.


Limiting foods and beverages higher in added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium, and limiting alcoholic beverages.




For consumers, USDA’s MyPlate translates and packages these principles of dietary guidance for Americans in a way that is handy and accessible. To share these messages broadly, USDA offers the 
Start Simple with MyPlate campaign
 and a new MyPlate website to help individuals, families, and communities make healthy food choices that are easy, accessible, and affordable, in addition to helping prevent chronic disease. For more information, please visit

 – The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) today issued a movement permit to Mr. S. Nicholas Claus of the North Pole, a broker with Worldwide Gifts, Unlimited. The permit will allow reindeer to enter and exit the United States between the hours of 7 p.m. December 24, 2020 and 7 a.m. December 25, 2020, through or over any U.S. border port.


“This is a holiday season like no other. But as I told my grandkids, Santa has immunity to COVID, so he and his reindeer will circle the globe as planned,” said USDA Marketing and Regulatory Programs Under Secretary Greg Ibach. “We are all looking forward to Mr. Claus’ special brand of Christmas cheer, this year more than ever. To help ensure a smooth trip, USDA worked with Worldwide Gifts Unlimited to issue this permit in advance and waived all applicable fees.”


Veterinary officials ensured the reindeer met all entry requirements before issuing the permit. It was noted on the health certificate that one reindeer, Rudolph, has a minor physical anomaly. The veterinarian indicated that Rudolph’s red nose, while bright, was normal for him and not a concern.


The reindeer will arrive pulling a wooden sleigh with jingling bells attached, filled with brightly wrapped gifts. Port personnel, who will wear appropriate personal protective equipment and follow all COVID safety rules, will clean and disinfect the runners and underside of the sleigh at the time of entry. They will also conduct a short visual inspection of the reindeer. Mr. Claus will disinfect his boots and thoroughly wash his hands. These measures are intended to prevent the entry of any livestock diseases the team may encounter during deliveries to farms around the world prior to entering the United States.


Mr. Claus also provided an advance list of what port personnel should expect upon their arrival. This includes a variety of food items, all of which come from approved locations and none of which pose a threat to U.S. animal or plant health.


“It’s important that Worldwide Gifts, Unlimited take all the right steps and precautions to protect against the potential introduction of pests and diseases,” explained Mr. Claus. “I appreciate USDA’s assistance every year as we gear up for our big night.”


Whether you see the smiles, joy, and wonder on children’s faces this Christmas morning in person or on video chat, enjoy the moment. Happy holidays from USDA!

21-Dec-20,/media/press-releases/2020/12/21/secretary-perdue-announces-groundbreaking-proposal-transfer,Secretary Perdue Announces Groundbreaking Proposal to Transfer Agricultural Animal Biotechnology Regulatory Framework to USDA,"(Washington, D.C., December 21, 2020)
 – Today, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue announced a significant step in modernizing regulations of agricultural animals modified or produced by genetic engineering. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) will be moving forward with an 
Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR)
 to solicit public input and feedback on a contemplated regulatory framework that would modernize our system into a scientifically-sound, risk-based, and predictable process that facilitates the development and use of these technologies for U.S. farmers and ranchers under USDA’s authorities. This initiative follows President Donald Trump’s 
Executive Order
 on agricultural biotechnology that called upon federal agencies to make regulatory improvements to rectify some of the long-standing barriers to innovation for U.S. agriculture.


“Our livestock producers need all the tools in the toolbox to help protect against animal diseases and continue to meet the challenge of feeding everyone now and into the future. If we do not put these safe biotechnology advances to work here at home, our competitors in other nations will,” said Secretary Perdue. “Science-based advances in biotechnology have great promise to continue to enhance rural prosperity and improve the quality of life across America’s heartland and around the globe. With this effort, we are outlining a pragmatic, science-based, and risk-based approach that focuses on potential risk to animal and livestock health, the environment, and food safety in order to provide our farmers and ranchers the tools they need to continue to feed, clothe and fuel the world.”


Background:


Last year, President Trump directed federal agencies to modernize the regulatory framework for agricultural biotechnology products by establishing regulatory approaches proportionate to the product’s risks, avoid unjustified distinctions across similar products, and promote future innovation and competitiveness. USDA will publish an ANPR on animal biotechnology as a keystone effort in fulfilling this Executive Order.


This ANPR will transition portions of FDA’s pre-existing animal biotechnology regulatory oversight to USDA. USDA will consult with FDA to ensure our reviews benefit from FDA’s expertise, while providing developers with a one-stop-shop for their products at USDA. USDA looks forward to FDA experts participating in the development of our review process.


Through this ANPR, USDA is proposing to establish a flexible, forward-looking, risk-proportionate and science-based regulatory framework that provides a predictable pathway to commercialization and keeps pace with advances in science and technology for certain farm animals (cattle, sheep, goats, swine, horses, mules, or other equines, catfish, and poultry) developed using genetic engineering intended for agricultural purposes.


USDA’s proposed safety review would cover molecular characterization, animal health (including noninfectious, infectious, and zoonotic diseases), efficacy (for disease and pest resistance traits), environmental considerations, food safety evaluation of any expressed substance (including allergenicity and compositional analyses of key components), and food storage and processing. USDA’s proposal would provide end-to-end regulatory oversight from pre-market reviews through post-market food safety monitoring of animals. USDA will continue to coordinate closely with the FDA to fulfill oversight responsibilities and provide the appropriate regulatory environment, ensuring the safety of products derived from new technologies, while fostering innovation at the same time.


Under the regulatory framework being contemplated, USDA would provide regulatory oversight from pre-market reviews through post-market food safety monitoring for certain farm animals developed using genetic engineering. USDA would promulgate regulations using the authorities granted to the Department through the Animal Health Protection Act (AHPA), the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA), and the Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA). Pursuant to these authorities, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) would conduct a safety assessment of organisms developed using genetic engineering that may increase an animal’s susceptibility to pests or diseases of livestock, including zoonotic diseases, or ability to transmit the same. The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) would conduct a pre-slaughter food safety assessment to ensure that the slaughter and processing of animals developed using genetic engineering would not result in a product that is unsound, unhealthful, unwholesome, or otherwise unfit for human food.

17-Dec-20,/media/press-releases/2020/12/17/trump-administration-sets-pace-food-loss-and-waste-reduction,Trump Administration Sets the Pace for Food Loss and Waste Reduction Efforts to Continue,"(Washington, D.C., December 17, 2020)
 – Today, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced the renewal of the 
joint agency formal agreement
 (PDF, 724 KB) including the 
Winning on Reducing Food Waste Initiative
. The agreement reaffirms the agencies’ commitment to improve coordination and communication efforts to better educate Americans on the impacts and importance of reducing food loss and waste. Food loss and waste negatively impact food security, the economy, communities, and the environment.


Since the Trump Administration launched the 
Winning on Reducing Food Waste Initiative
, the collaborative effort has achieved great success. Public-private partnerships, like the 
United States Food Loss and Waste 2030 Champions
, are key to successfully reducing food loss and waste by implementing proven strategies and sharing best practices. In 2020, the Trump Administration welcomed ten new businesses and organizations to the 2030 Champions.


Today's renewed three-year agreement will continue to build on these successful partnerships and reiterate our shared commitment to work towards the national goal of reducing food loss and waste by 50 percent by 2030.


“The United States is getting a handle on its serious food waste problem,”
 said EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler
. “The three-year renewal of this joint agency agreement will help our country achieve its ambitious goal of cutting food waste by 50 percent by 2030.”


“Our nation’s agricultural abundance should be used to nourish those in need, not fill the trash,” 
said U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue
. “As the world’s population continues to grow and the food systems continue to evolve, now is the time to continue to educate consumers and businesses alike on the need for food waste reduction.”


“We’ve seen great strides in food loss and waste reduction since first entering the joint agency formal agreement with our federal colleagues, and through collaborative efforts with our public and private partners,”
 said FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn, M.D.
 “At FDA, we’ve encouraged food manufacturers and retailers to standardize the way quality-based date labels are used on packaged foods and developed 
videos and materials
 to educate consumers. With these continued partnerships and important efforts, we’re on track to see a 50 percent reduction of food waste by 2030.”


As part of the 
Winning on Reducing Food Waste Initiative
, EPA, USDA, and FDA issued its FY2019-2020 Federal Interagency Strategy in April 2019, which identifies six priority areas on which the agencies will focus their efforts to reduce food loss and waste in the U.S. In May 2020, the Federal Interagency Strategy was updated by listing contributing efforts for each of the strategy's six priority action areas:




Priority Area 1: Enhance Interagency Coordination


Priority Area 2: Increase Consumer Education and Outreach Efforts


Priority Area 3: Improve Coordination and Guidance on Food Loss and Waste Measurement


Priority Area 4: Clarify and Communicate Information on Food Safety, Food Date Labels, and Food Donations


Priority Area 5: Collaborate with Private Industry to Reduce Food Loss and Waste Across the Supply Chain


Priority Area 6: Encourage Food Waste Reduction by Federal Agencies in their Respective Facilities




The agencies also launched partnerships with organizations at the forefront of food loss and waste reduction efforts. In April 2019, the agencies signed an agreement with 
ReFED
(link is external)
, a network of the nation's leading business, nonprofit, foundation, and government leaders committed to reducing U.S. food waste. In October 2019, another partnership with the 
Food Waste Reduction Alliance
, formalized collaboration on education and outreach efforts with three major sectors of the supply chain: food manufacturing, retail, and restaurant and food service.


Background


The 
Winning on Reducing Food Waste Initiative
 is a 
collaborative effort
 (PDF, 579 KB) among USDA, EPA, and FDA to reduce food loss and waste through combined and agency-specific actions. Individually and collectively, these agencies contribute to the initiative, encourage long-term food waste reductions, and work toward the goal of reducing food loss and waste in the U.S. These actions include research, community investments, education and outreach, voluntary programs, public-private partnerships, tool development, technical assistance, event participation, and policy discussion.

Meeting the national goal of cutting food waste in half by 2030 will take a sustained commitment from everyone. Success requires action from the entire food system.


Facts About Food Waste




EPA estimates that more food (over 70 billion pounds) reaches landfills than any other material in everyday trash, constituting 24 percent of discarded municipal solid waste.


Landfills are the third largest source of human-related methane emissions in the U.S.


Food waste not only impacts landfill space and emissions, it negatively impacts the economy. USDA estimates the value of food loss and waste for retailers and consumers each year to be over $161 billion.


Wasted food also results in unnecessary expenditures of U.S. domestic energy resources. Every time food is lost or wasted, all the energy that went into producing that food is also wasted.

17-Dec-20,/media/press-releases/2020/12/17/usda-nasa-sign-agreement-improve-agricultural-earth-science,"USDA, NASA Sign Agreement to Improve Agricultural, Earth Science Research","(Washington, D.C., December 17, 2020)
 - The U.S. Department of Agriculture and NASA have signed a memorandum of understanding aimed at strengthening their longstanding partnership on space-based assets benefitting life on Earth.


The agreement brings together NASA’s experience with technology development and space-borne Earth science measurements and USDA’s scientific experience and knowledge of agricultural production, resource conservation, food security and safety, and forests and working lands.


USDA and NASA will explore research gaps of importance to the agricultural community that could be addressed through innovative Earth observation systems and technologies developed over the next decade. The collaboration also will address recommendations made in the 2017 National Academies’ Earth Science Decadal Survey.


“As we’ve seen over the past 100 years, increasing innovation in agriculture is limitless,” said U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue. “This partnership between USDA and NASA will bring together the best research, science, and technology we have to offer to help produce more food to feed the growing world. We are continuing an already great collaborative effort to utilize space-based technologies across sectors and into agriculture.”


“When we combine research on the International Space Station with the amazing capabilities that Earth observation provides, I believe that NASA, in partnership with USDA, could transform farming and bolster agricultural production in ways we can’t even imagine today,” said NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine. “Microgravity research can unlock secrets in a wide variety of fields, and I’m particularly excited about our agency’s potential impact on next-generation agricultural techniques.”


The agreement also will leverage USDA’s connections with the agricultural community and the global marketplace.


The partnership outlined in the agreement will benefit a variety of Earth and space-based goals, including activities in support of NASA’s 
Artemis program
, which will land the first woman and the next man on the Moon and establish sustainable exploration with our commercial and international partners. Plant-related research on the International Space Station, and other space or ground platforms, may lead to creative new ways to improve American and global agriculture, protect the environment, and contribute to better human health.


In addition, the agencies collaborate on education and communication activities to inspire youth in America to pursue careers in STEM and agriculture through the National Science and Technology Council’s Committee on STEM Education.

 – U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue today applauded the accomplishments made by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) over the past year.


“While this was a tough year with the coronavirus, historic wildfires, and weather damage, USDA met these challenges with a multitude of programs and services to support Americans and keep our agricultural sector running and responsive to the country’s needs,” said Secretary Perdue. “We salute our mission areas and agencies for keeping our customers front and center, serving the American people, farmers, ranchers, foresters, and producers.”


Farmers to Families Food Box Program:


USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) purchased $8.6 billion in food for delivery to food banks, churches, schools, community organizations, tribal organizations, and international food aid organizations through various programs during Fiscal Year 2020. Using Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP) funding, USDA announced the 
Farmers to Families Food Box Program
 on April 17, 2020. Through this program, USDA has been partnering with national, regional and local distributors, whose workforces have been significantly impacted by the closure of restaurants, hotels and other food service businesses, to purchase up to $4.5 billion in fresh fruits and vegetables, dairy products and meat products from American producers of all sizes. Distributors then package these products into family-sized boxes and transport them to food banks, community and faith-based organizations, and other nonprofits serving Americans in need. 
The Food Box Program
 has provided more than 125 million food boxes to Americans in need and will purchase nearly $4.5 billion worth of food by the end of the year.

Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP) Funding:


Working with the Office of the Chief Economist (OCE), the Office of the General Counsel (OGC), and the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS); FSA and the Farm Production and Conservation Business Center quickly built and delivered two rounds of the 
CFAP
, which provides financial assistance to help producers absorb some of the revenue losses and increased marketing costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. So far, CFAP 1 and CFAP 2 made available $30 billion in relief. Additionally, USDA’s Farm Service Agency (FSA) and Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) worked together to adopt new processes for electronic signatures to ensure producer and field staff could use electronic tools safely and securely.

Ensuring Access to Food:


USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) took unprecedented steps to ensure that children and low-income individuals had access to nutritious food in response to the pandemic as well. FNS issued more than 4,000 program flexibilities to adjust to local needs and maximize access for all eligible families across each of USDA’s 15 nutrition assistance programs. In October, USDA announced it would allow free meals to continue to be available to all children throughout the entire 2020-2021 school year. This unprecedented move is part of USDA’s unwavering commitment to ensuring all children across America have access to nutritious food as the nation recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Trade:


In January, the United States and China reached a historic agreement on a 
Phase One trade deal
 that set forth structural and technical reforms to China’s trade practices in the areas of intellectual property, technology transfer, agriculture, financial services, and currency and foreign exchange. The Phase One agreement addressed many non-tariff barriers to U.S. agriculture; it also included a commitment by China to make substantial purchases of U.S. goods and services. This agreement led to a record pace of Chinese purchases in many sectors, boosting agricultural commodity prices. In July, 
The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA)
 entered into force, replacing the decades-old NAFTA, expanding market access for U.S. farmers to sell their products to our closest neighbors. In ongoing engagements with 
the European Union
, and as the U.S. pursues a post-Brexit free trade agreement with the United Kingdom, Secretary Perdue and USDA called for transparent, science-based trade policies that foster innovation and ensure that agriculture remains economically, environmentally and socially sustainable.

Customer Service:


USDA’s Farm Service Agency (FSA) stood up a call center to help producers with questions and assistance with program applications for CFAP and 
Seafood Trade Relief Program
. The call center has received over 25,000 calls, including over 800 in Spanish, since its inception in May. In just two weeks, the Farm Production and Conservation Business Center developed and deployed a 
new tool
 that walks producers through eligible commodities for CFAP and outlines their next steps. Another new decision tool, the 
Conservation Concerns Tool
, gives landowners conservation solutions to fit their business needs. In addition to searching for information on farmers.gov, producers can also 
log into farmers.gov
 to manage their conservation business online.


Rural Broadband:


USDA invested $1.3 billion to support rural broadband expansion through the 
ReConnect Pilot Program
. Included in this total is $85 million provided through the CARES Act. In total, these investments are connecting approximately 280,000 households, 19,978 farms and 10,053 businesses to high-speed internet.


Innovation and Sustainability Agenda:


Through the 
Agriculture Innovation Agenda
, USDA committed to stimulate innovation so that American agriculture can achieve the goal of increasing U.S. agricultural production by 40 percent while cutting the environmental footprint of U.S. agriculture in half by 2050. The initiative is comprised of four main components; developing a research strategy; aligning the work of our customer-facing agencies and integrating innovative technologies and practices into USDA programs; setting benchmarks to track progress toward meeting future food, fiber, fuel, feed and climate demands. As one example of Agriculture Innovation Agenda efforts, USDA, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are working together to deliver on the U.S. national goal of reducing food loss and waste by 50 percent by 2030 through consumer education, food date labeling, measurement, and collaboration with private industry.

USDA Agency Accomplishments:


USDA serves the American people at more than 4,500 locations across the country. While each mission area accomplished a great deal in 2020, notable accomplishments are as follows:


Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS)
 purchased $8.6 billion in food for delivery to food banks, churches, schools, community organizations, tribal organizations, and international food aid organizations through various programs during Fiscal Year 2020. Using Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP) funding, USDA partnered with national, regional and local distributors, whose workforces were significantly impacted by the closure of restaurants, hotels and other food service businesses, to purchase and distribute agricultural products to American families across the country. The food was packaged and distributed through the innovative 
Farmers to Families Food Box Program
, begun in May. The food box program has provided more than 125 million food boxes to Americans in need and will purchase nearly $4.5 billion worth of food by the end of the year. In addition, AMS purchased $1.3 billion worth of American-produced agricultural products through the 
Food Purchase and Distribution Program
 (FPDP), one of three 
USDA trade mitigation programs
 aimed at assisting farmers suffering from damages caused by unjustified trade retaliation by foreign nations. AMS also continued its support for the nation’s food safety net through its regular, ongoing 
Section 32 purchases
 of a variety of domestically produced and processed agricultural products. Approximately $700 million in Section 32 purchases were made for 
The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP)
 this year, of which over $496 million in purchases are scheduled for delivery in FY 2021.


Agricultural Research Service (ARS)
 scientists identified a promising, highly effective new vaccine that protects against the circulating strain of African Swine Fever that is affecting the pork industry in Europe and Asia. In just two months, ARS researchers produced the entire genome of the Asian giant hornet, a new invasive insect that is a threat to honey bee colonies. ARS made the data freely accessible to researchers even before publishing in a scientific journal to help coordinate an effective and rapid response. ARS scientists also designed the scent lure for traps that led to the detection and destruction of the first nest of these invasive insects in the United States. To help inform livestock and poultry producers, ARS initiated emergency response research on SARS-CoV-2; the research demonstrated that livestock and poultry species are not a source of infection for SARS-CoV-2 and insects are not a risk factor for the transmission of the virus to humans.


Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)
 played a vital role to ensure the free flow of agricultural trade by keeping U.S. agricultural industries free from pests and diseases. Examples include eradicating a disease-causing bacteria (Ralstonia solanacearum race 3 biovar 2) from more than 650 U.S. commercial greenhouses in just two months; eradicating an outbreak of avian influenza in North and South Carolina, preventing spread to other areas and limiting the overall impact on the poultry industry; publishing the final SECURE rule, the first-ever major revision of USDA’s biotechnology regulations, which streamlines and modernizes our system; and establishing the first-ever robust foot-and-mouth disease vaccine bank.


Economic Research Service (ERS)
 produced timely economic research and data to address emerging national and global issues. Among these efforts, Commodity Outlook reports on how the pandemic has affected commodity markets, as well as contributions to the new U.S. Census Bureau Household Pulse Survey, which provides near real-time data on households experiencing food insufficiency, or not having enough food, among other measures. Other ERS research helps decisionmakers with emerging issues, such as a study on how the European Commission’s new Farm to Fork and Biodiversity Strategies might affect agricultural production and food security. ERS also coordinated with the National Agricultural Statistics Service to conduct the Survey of Irrigation Organizations, which will provide the first data in more than 40 years on the operation of surface-water delivery and groundwater management organizations and their influence on on-farm water use and drought resiliency of the irrigation sector.


Farm Production and Conservation (FPAC) Business Center
 streamlined processes and improved mission support delivery, which enables staff of USDA’s Farm Service Agency, Natural Resources Conservation Service, and Risk Management Agency to continue providing best-in-class customer service and delivery of farm programs. The Business Center improved fleet management through enhanced reporting tools and new processes for vehicle-sharing, decreasing underutilized vehicles in the fleet by 21 percent in recent years. The Business Center has also provided critical support – from software to rulemaking – for the implementation of programs, including the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program 2, which was developed and deployed in six weeks. The Business Center has also led development of farmers.gov, a single web experience that provides farmers, ranchers, and forest landowners with self-service applications and program information.


Farm Service Agency (FSA)
 helped farmers, livestock producers and foresters weather a tough 2020, marked with a pandemic and natural disasters. This included delivering two rounds of the 
Coronavirus Food Assistance Program
 (CFAP), which to date has made available $30 billion to help producers absorb some of the increased marketing costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. FSA’s suite of disaster assistance programs provided more than $212 million to help offset losses from the year’s wildfires, hurricanes, and drought. FSA also helped farmers and ranchers get the financing they needed to start, expand or maintain a family farm, obligating more than $7.5 billion in direct and guaranteed farm ownership and operating loans, the highest in agency history. This includes more than $3.4 billion for beginning farmers, also an agency record.


The
 Food and Nutrition Service (FNS)
 responded to the COVID-19 pandemic in many ways, including 
Emergency Meals to You
, a public-private partnership which delivered more than 40 million meals to approximately 400,000 children in rural areas during Spring and Summer 2020 school closures. FNS also stood up a new version of food assistance called 
Pandemic EBT
, to cover the cost of meals children would normally receive at school. FNS quickly expanded access to 
online purchasing
 for more than 97 percent of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) participants in 46 states and the District of Columbia. FNS continues to work with interested states and retailers, with a priority on independently owned and operated retailers. This year also realized key policies in line with the agency’s commitment to customer service, program integrity and self-sufficiency, including the first ever SNAP 
Employment and Training (E&T) National Work Forum
, bringing together more than 1,500 partners nationwide to discuss ways to move SNAP participants forward into work opportunities.


Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS)
 advanced science-based and data-driven initiatives to modernize policies, operations, and inspection systems. Among them, a regulatory change that modernizes swine slaughter inspection which establishments can choose to operate under, as well as finalizing the Egg Products Inspection Regulations rule, the first time that egg product inspection methods have been modernized since Congress passed the Eggs Product Inspection Act in 1970. During the COVID-19 pandemic, FSIS protected its employees by supplying and requiring the use of protective equipment as outlined in guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). FSIS continued to fulfill its Congressionally mandated mission to ensure the safety and wholesomeness of meat, poultry, and egg products provided to consumers. No FSIS-regulated establishments closed due to a lack of inspection personnel.


USDA’s 
Foreign Agricultural Service
 supported policy and marketing channels to promote free, fair and reciprocal trade and to expand opportunities for U.S. agriculture in the global marketplace. The historic 
Phase One trade agreement with China
, addresses a multitude of structural barriers that had impeded exports of U.S. food and agricultural products. The United States also strengthened ties with its North American neighbors and expanded opportunities for U.S. agriculture via the landmark 
U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA)
, which entered into force in July, and made substantial progress towards a free trade agreement with Kenya, while also 
successfully resolving longstanding trade issues there
. 
The pandemic changed the way U.S. agriculture conducted business and interacted with international audiences
, underscoring the value of USDA’s ongoing efforts to provide vital market intelligence to U.S. stakeholders and also leading to the development of innovative new marketing channels such as 
virtual trade shows
 that are allowing U.S. exporters to connect directly, yet safely, with potential overseas customers.


USDA’s Forest Service (USFS)
 opened hundreds of thousands of acres of national forests to visitor access and sold more timber than it has in the past 22 years, providing a sustainable flow of forest products and supporting rural economies. In addition, the agency improved forest conditions and reduced wildfire risk on over 2.2 million acres through timber harvest, removing hazardous fuels like dead and downed trees, and combating disease, insect and invasive species infestations. The Forest Service is working more closely than ever with tribes, states, and local partners through Shared Stewardship Agreements to make sure the right work happens in the right place at the right time. So far, 44 states and territories are involved, and agreements have resulted in increased forest resiliency, safer communities, reduced wildfire risk, job production, and stabilized economies.


National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) 
delivered on its mission to provide timely, accurate, and useful official federal data to the public on nearly all aspects of U.S. agriculture. NASS released nearly 400 scheduled reports, including many topics connected to the 2017 Census of Agriculture. The agriculture census is the only source of uniform, comprehensive, and impartial agriculture data for every county in the nation. These 
deep-dive reports
 looked at states and counties; race, ethnicity and gender; market value of agricultural products; congressional districts; Navajo nations; organics; American Indian Reservations: watersheds; and specialty crops. NASS also released results of the censuses of agriculture for Puerto Rico, Guam, the Northern Marianas Islands, American Samoa, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. NASS added an open-access, customizable, web-based geospatial tool called 
Crop Condition and Soil Moisture Analytics
 (Crop-CASMA) to its 
geospatial portfolio
. Crop-CASMA produces near real-time topsoil and subsoil moisture data aligned with NASS’s weekly crop progress reporting calendar.


National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA)
 awarded $24 million in grants for universities, colleges, small business, technical schools and youth development programs, such as 4-H, to spur rapid response innovation addressing the pandemic. To expand the pipeline of tomorrow’s agricultural scientific and professional workforce, NIFA awarded grants, scholarships, and Centers of Excellence designations to minority-serving colleges and universities. NIFA and the National Science Foundation announced 
seven new artificial intelligence institutes
 across the country to accelerate research, expand America's workforce and transform society for the future. NIFA awarded 
12 grants totaling more than $7 million
 to initiate research on big data analytics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and predictive technologies needed to keep U.S. agriculture on the leading edge of food and agricultural production.


Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)
 worked with agricultural producers to develop more than 100,000 conservation plans as well as place conservation practices and enhancements on more than 19 million acres through the 
Environmental Quality Incentives Program
 (EQIP) and 
Conservation Stewardship Program
 (CSP). NRCS helped producers protect more than 230,000 acres of wetlands, grasslands and prime farmlands with conservation easements. NRCS also works closely with conservation partners and other organizations to spur innovation and to increase impacts of conservation. In October, NRCS awarded more than $14.6 million in 
Conservation Innovation Grants
 to 24 projects, generating more than $15.3 million in partner matching funds.


The Office of the Chief Economist (OCE)
 developed estimates of COVID-19-related damages to the U.S. agricultural sector; these estimates were then used to develop payment rates for the Coronavirus Food Assistance Programs. In addition, OCE estimated impacts of adverse weather on agricultural producers to assist Departmental decision making on drought, hurricanes, derecho, and wildfires. OCE’s World Agricultural Outlook Board coordinated and developed USDA’s annual 10-year agricultural commodity projections and the monthly 
World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE)
, the most widely used source for domestic and global commodity market estimates and forecasts available. OCE coordinated USDA’s Agricultural Outlook Forum, USDA’s premiere annual event, which drew more than 1,800 participants. OCE provided input on numerous rulemakings -- including more than 140 pesticide-related EPA documents -- which ensured consideration of agricultural interests.


The
 
Office of Partnerships and Public Engagement (OPPE)
 hosted more than 50 statewide community prosperity summits to focus on solutions to challenges facing rural and underserved communities and connect them to the education, tools, and resources available to them through USDA programs and initiatives. In 2020, OPPE also connected hundreds of faith-based, youth, military, and community organizations to distributors to form partnerships through the Farmers to Families Food Box Program during COVID-19. This year, OPPE reestablished the Advisory Committee on Minority Farmers; the USDA-1890 Land-Grant Universities Task Force; the USDA-1994 Tribal College Leadership Group; and the USDA-Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities Leadership Group. OPPE awarded more than $19 million across 50 nonprofits, institutions of higher education, and tribes that support socially disadvantaged and veteran farmers and ranchers.


Through the 
Office of Tribal Relations
 (OTR), USDA remains committed to Indian Country through broad intergovernmental and outreach efforts. The Office of Tribal relations has helped ensure that policy makers at USDA are aware of challenges and barriers to programs to Indian Country and work quickly to ensure that programs and services do not have an adverse impact on tribes, tribal organizations or tribal citizens. USDA is committed to upholding its government-to-government relationship through consultations on topics ranging from the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations to industrial hemp.


USDA’s 
Research, Education, and Economics Mission Area
 (REE) released the 
USDA Science Blueprint
, which will set the vision for USDA’s scientific research for the next five years. USDA’s agricultural research is vital to helping our farmers, ranchers, producers, and foresters increase efficiency and productivity, and our science agencies play an integral role in setting new visions for innovation through their work. This will serve as a roadmap to guide scientific collaborations across USDA and with our partnering research organizations.


Risk Management Agency (RMA)
 administered crop insurance to help agricultural producers weather this year’s many natural disasters. In 2020, federal crop insurance provided more than $113 billion in total coverage, and to date, has paid out more than $5.8 billion in indemnities. RMA worked diligently to maximize flexibilities to help producers better cope with the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
This included
 extending deadlines, waiving certain requirements and deferring interest. RMA also worked with Approved Insurance Providers (AIPs) to ensure continuity of crop insurance services such as processing policies, claims, and written agreements. And finally, RMA has rolled out new coverage options, including those that help producers impacted by hurricanes, as well as expanded options for hemp producers.


Rural Development (RD)
 invested in a range of services and programs to support rural America. The 
ReConnect Pilot Program
 invested $1.3 billion for rural broadband expansion to connect approximately 280,000 households, 19,978 farms and 10,053 businesses to high-speed internet. RD invested a record $6.3 billion in 125 projects to 
upgrade or build electric infrastructure
. Another $2.1 billion will expand access to 
safe drinking water and improve wastewater management systems
 for 2.1 million rural Americans. The 
Business and Industry (B&I) Loan Guarantee Program
 brought $1.7 billion to 384 rural businesses; these investments created or saved nearly 18,000 jobs. The 
Community Facilities Programs
 funded the construction or modernization of 1,683 essential community facilities such as rural hospitals, educational institutions and public safety facilities, benefiting 20 million rural residents, across all 50 states, Guam, Virgin Islands and the Western Pacific. The 
Distance Learning and Telemedicine Grant Program
 invested $71.5 million in 116 projects to benefit 12 million rural residents.

USDA is an equal opportunity provider, employer and lender."
14-Dec-20,/media/press-releases/2020/12/14/usda-announces-joint-final-rule-regarding-equal-treatment-faith,USDA Announces Joint Final Rule Regarding Equal Treatment of Faith-Based Organizations USDA-Supported Social Service Programs,"(Washington, D.C., December 14, 2020)
 – Today, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced a joint final rule with eight other Agencies—the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Labor, the Department of Education, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Agency for International Development, and the Department of Veterans Affairs—to implement President Trump’s Executive Order No. 13831, on the Establishment of a White House Faith and Opportunity Initiative (May 3, 2018). This rule ensures that religious and non-religious organizations are treated equally in USDA-supported programs, and it clarifies that religious organizations do not lose their legal protections and rights just because they participate in federal programs and activities.


“This rule ensures this Department lives up to its motto – to ‘do right and feed everyone.’ It means that faith-based organizations can participate in USDA programs and provide assistance without facing additional burdens,” said U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue.


Background:


This final rule ensures equal treatment for faith-based organizations, consistent with the Constitution and other federal law. It removes requirements in prior regulations that placed unequal burdens on religious organizations, cast unwarranted suspicion on them, and were in tension with their religious liberty rights. This final rule also clarifies that religious organizations do not lose various legal protections because they participate in federal programs and activities, such as the rights to accommodations and conscience protections under the First Amendment, Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and other federal laws.


This final rule preserves most of the existing regulations governing participation of religious organizations in the USDA’s financial assistance programs, including provisions barring providers from discriminating against beneficiaries based on religion and requiring that any religious activities by the organization be separated in time or location from any services directly funded with federal money.


The final rule was drafted in response to Executive Order 13831, issued in May 2018. The Agencies worked collaboratively to draft notices of proposed rulemaking that were published or delivered to Congress in January 2020. The nine agencies then received over 95,000 public comments from a range of interested parties, including Members of Congress; state and local governments, agencies, and officials; faith-based services providers and umbrella organizations; advocacy organizations; and individuals. The Agencies considered those comments, modified their regulations to address concerns raised in the comments, and drafted responses included in the final rule.

9-Dec-20,/media/press-releases/2020/12/09/trump-administration-invests-12-million-high-speed-broadband-rural,Trump Administration Invests $12 Million in High-Speed Broadband in Rural Louisiana,"ALEXANDRIA, La., Dec. 9, 2020
 – The Trump Administration today announced that the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is investing approximately $12 million to provide broadband service in unserved and underserved rural areas in Louisiana. This investment is part of the $550 million Congress allocated to the 
second round of the ReConnect Program
.


“Broadband is critical for rural communities to grow, attract businesses and maintain a high quality of life. The funding announced today will connect rural homes, businesses, farms and community facilities such as health care services, fire stations and schools with adequate access to reliable broadband,” USDA Louisiana State Director for Rural Development Roy Holleman said. “Under the leadership of President Trump and Agriculture Secretary Perdue, USDA is committed to being a strong partner in deploying this critical infrastructure in Louisiana and across all of America’s rural communities, because we know when rural America thrives, all of America thrives.”


Star Telephone Company Inc. will use a $6.1 million ReConnect grant, and a $6.1 million Reconnect loan to deploy a fiber-to-premises network. This high-speed broadband network will connect 3,857 people, 69 businesses, 149 farms, five educational facilities and two essential community facilities in Rapides, Concordia, Pointe Coupee, Avoyelles and Evangeline parishes in Louisiana.


Background:


In March 2018, Congress provided $600 million to USDA to expand broadband infrastructure and services in rural America. On December 13, 2018, Secretary Perdue announced the rules of the program, called “ReConnect,” including how the loans and grants will be awarded to help build broadband infrastructure in rural America.


On April 20, 2020, USDA announced the Department has received 172 applications for $1.57 billion in Round Two of the ReConnect Program. The second round will enable USDA to implement innovative new solutions to rural connectivity by leveraging financial options with our partners and continuing the success of the first round of funding. The application window for Round Two closed on April 15, 2020.


In Round One of the ReConnect Program, USDA invested $698 million to bring high-speed broadband e-Connectivity to approximately 167,000 households, 17,000 rural small businesses and farms, and more than 500 health care centers, educational facilities and critical community facilities located in 33 states.

23-Nov-20,/media/press-releases/2020/11/23/usda-launches-askusda-improves-and-streamlines-customer-experience,"USDA Launches AskUSDA, Improves and Streamlines Customer Experience","(Wa
shington, D.C., November 18, 2020) –
 Today, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced the official launch of the AskUSDA Contact Center program. The AskUSDA Contact Center will serve as the “one front door” for phone, chat, and web inquires, transforming how the public interacts with USDA and providing an enhanced experience for the public.


Prior to the creation and implementation of AskUSDA, members of the public had to navigate dozens of phone numbers and had no chat function or online platform for self-service, creating frustrations and inefficiencies.
  
AskUSDA was created to make USDA more responsive to the public by providing a single destination for phone, chat, and web inquiries. 
Whether it’s talking to a USDA representative via phone, chatting with a live agent on our website, or communicating with USDA via e-mail, the public will have streamlined access.


The launch of AskUSDA delivers a centralized contact center that offers customer service and consistent information for the public. With over 29 agencies and offices, USDA’s mission impacts every single person in the U.S. and hundreds of millions around the globe. AskUSDA assures that farmers, researchers, travelers, parents, and more have efficient access to the information and resources they need.


AskUSDA is set up to handle common questions across programs that service a variety of audiences. For example, customers who may have basic questions about USDA’s nutrition services can be assisted across phone, e-mail, and web chat by trained AskUSDA representatives, and customers who may have complicated questions about loan programs can be quickly connected to agency experts. AskUSDA also hosts over five thousand articles for a self-service option to help with more common questions such as food safety inquiries or pet-travel guidance.


Over the course of its pilot program, AskUSDA successfully assisted with over 93,000 citizen inquiries, and the AskUSDA website resulted in over 1.4 million knowledge article page views. USDA looks forward to continuing to implement this enhanced best in class contact center across the Department. 


The public can contact AskUSDA by phone at (833) ONE-USDA with representatives available 9:00am-5:30pm 
EST 
weekdays. The website (
https://ask.usda.gov/

USDA is an equal opportunity provider, employer and lender"
23-Nov-20,/media/press-releases/2020/11/23/usda-shares-easy-home-advice-handling-food-safely-thanksgiving,USDA Shares Easy At-Home Advice for Handling Food Safely this Thanksgiving,"(Washington, D.C., November 23, 2020)
 – This week, Americans will enjoy a delicious meal on Thanksgiving Day with family and friends – either in person or virtually. Taking the necessary steps toward safe food handling and sanitation will help protect you and your loved ones this year. To make sure your Thanksgiving meal is prepared safely, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is offering food safety advice to reduce foodborne illness, including on Thanksgiving Day.


“Our data shows that consumers can reduce their likelihood of foodborne illness by focusing on good hand hygiene and other food safety practices,” said Dr. Mindy Brashears, USDA’s Under Secretary for Food Safety. “As home chefs nationwide prepare their Thanksgiving meals, proper handwashing and avoiding cross contamination in the kitchen are critical to keeping your loved ones safe.”


Wash Your Hands


The first step to safe food preparation is to clean. In 
recent USDA observational research
, participants did not even attempt to wash their hands, or did not wash their hands sufficiently about 95 percent of the time before and during meal preparation.


Handwashing is recommended to control the spread of germs, especially before, during and after preparing food (especially after touching raw meat or poultry).


Thawing the Turkey


Frozen turkeys should never be thawed on the counter or in hot water and must not be left at room temperature for more than two hours. The best method to thaw the turkey is in the refrigerator since this allows slow, safe thawing. When thawing turkey in the refrigerator, allow about 24 hours for every five pounds of turkey. Once thawed, it can remain safe in the fridge for one to two days. Other safe thawing methods include a cold-water bath or the microwave. If you use either of these thawing methods, you should cook the turkey immediately after it is thawed. If using the cold-water method, allow 30 minutes per pound, and submerge the turkey in its original wrapping to avoid cross-contamination. If thawing in the microwave, make sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions when defrosting the turkey.


Avoid Cross-Contamination


In a recent study, USDA found 60 percent of kitchen sinks were contaminated with germs after participants washed or rinsed poultry. To avoid this cross-contamination risk, do not wash your turkey. But if you do wash your turkey or put your turkey in the sink, you need to fully clean and sanitize your sink. Cleaning and sanitizing is a two-step process. To clean, rub down surfaces — including the sink, cutting boards, and counter tops — with soap and hot water, and then sanitize them with a cleaning solution to remove any residual germs you cannot see. You can use a homemade solution of one tablespoon of unscented, liquid chlorine bleach in one gallon of water. Let air dry.


Do Not Stuff the Turkey


Although many choose to stuff the turkey, USDA does not recommend doing so for optimal safety. Instead, cook stuffing outside of the turkey cavity to reduce cross-contamination risk. This will also allow your turkey to cook more quickly.


Cooking to the Safe Temperature


A whole turkey is safe when cooked to a minimum internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit as measured by a food thermometer in three parts: the thickest part of the breast, the innermost part of the wing, and the innermost part of the thigh. Even if the turkey has a pop-up temperature indicator, you should still use a food thermometer to check that the bird has reached at least 165 degrees Fahrenheit in those three places. If you are planning to cook a turkey breast instead of a whole turkey, check the temperature with the food thermometer (165 degrees Fahrenheit) at the thickest part the breast. All previously cooked side dishes should be reheated to 165 degrees Fahrenheit as measured by a food thermometer as well.


The Two-Hour Rule


To make sure food stays safe to eat through the weekend, all perishable items should be refrigerated within two hours of when they finished cooking. After two hours, perishable food will be in the Danger Zone (40 to 140 degrees Fahrenheit) too long, which is when bacteria can multiply quickly and cause the food to become unsafe. If foods have been left out for more than two hours they should be discarded.


Store and Reheat Leftovers


Store leftovers in small, shallow containers in the refrigerator until the Monday after Thanksgiving Day or in the freezer for later use. Shallow containers help cool leftovers more quickly than storing them in large containers. Reheat leftovers to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit. Check the internal temperature of the food in several places with a food thermometer after allowing a resting time.

USDA is an equal opportunity provider, employer and lender."
18-Nov-20,/media/press-releases/2020/11/18/usda-forest-service-announces-key-changes-nepa-procedures,USDA Forest Service Announces Key Changes to NEPA Procedures,"WASHINGTON, Nov. 18, 2020
 – The USDA Forest Service today announced the publication of a final rule implementing key changes to its National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulations. The changes include new tools and flexibilities to tackle critical land management challenges as part of a broader agency effort to better serve the American people through timely, high-quality management decisions affecting infrastructure, permitting and restoration of natural resources on their national forests and grasslands.


“These changes will ensure we do the appropriate level of environmental analysis to fit the work, locations and conditions,” said U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue. “The new categorical exclusions will ultimately improve our ability to maintain and repair the infrastructure people depend on to use and enjoy their national forests – such as roads, trails, campgrounds and other facilities.”


Categorical exclusions are a type of analysis for certain activities that typically do not have significant environmental effects. The rule establishes new or revised categorical exclusions that eliminate redundant efforts, allowing for previous environmental analyses to be used to support new decisions under certain circumstances, among other efficiencies.


The Forest Service finalized the regulations following its review of extensive public engagement and decades of experience complying with NEPA, one of the nation’s foundational environmental laws. The changes will allow Forest Service officials to concentrate resources on projects that are potentially more complex or have greater public interest, while also meeting NEPA requirements and fully honoring the agency’s environmental stewardship and public engagement responsibilities.


The updated regulations will publish tomorrow, Nov. 19 in the Federal Register and will take effect immediately. For additional details about the rule, visit

18-Nov-20,/media/press-releases/2020/11/18/usda-opens-registration-2021-agricultural-outlook-forum,USDA Opens Registration for the 2021 Agricultural Outlook Forum,"(Washington, D.C., November 18, 2020)
 – Registration is now open for the 97th annual Agricultural Outlook Forum (AOF), the largest annual meeting and premiere event of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The two-day Forum will take place 
on Feb. 18-19, 2021
. Due to COVID-19 and current restrictions on large gatherings in the Washington, D.C. area, USDA will hold the 2021 Forum virtually for the first time and registration will be free for the event.


The 2021 Forum, themed “Building on Innovation: A Pathway to Resilience,” builds on USDA’s 
Agriculture Innovation Agenda
, launched earlier this year to align USDA’s resources, programs, and research toward the goal of increasing U.S. agricultural production by 40 percent while cutting the environmental footprint of U.S. agriculture in half by 2050. The Forum will feature a panel of distinguished guest speakers and 30 breakout sessions developed by agencies across USDA. Topics covered include the food price outlook, innovations in agriculture, U.S. and global agricultural trade developments, and frontiers in sustainability and conservation. In addition, the USDA Chief Economist will unveil the Department’s latest outlook for U.S. commodity markets and trade, and discuss the U.S. farm income situation.


The 2021 Forum’s program will be announced in early December.


About USDA’s Outlook Forum


USDA’s Agricultural Outlook Forum began in 1923 to distribute and interpret national forecasts to farmers in the field. The goal was to provide the information developed through economic forecasting to farmers so they had the tools to read market signals and avoid producing beyond demand. Since then, the event has developed into a unique platform where key stakeholders from the agricultural sector in the United States and around the world come together every year to discuss current and emerging topics and trends in the sector. More than 1,800 people attended the 2020 Forum.


The Agricultural Outlook Forum, which is organized by USDA’s Office of the Chief Economist together with other USDA agencies, is independent of commercial interests and aims to facilitate information sharing among stakeholders and generate the transparency that supports well-functioning open markets.

 – The Trump Administration today announced that the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is investing $11.3 million to provide broadband service in unserved and underserved rural areas in Alaska. This investment is part of the $550 million Congress allocated to the 
second round of the ReConnect Program
.


“Broadband is a cornerstone to prosperity in Alaska’s rural communities because it is essential to economic development, as well as access to health care, educational opportunities and connections to people and services,” USDA Alaska State Director for Rural Development Jerry Ward said. “Under the leadership of President Trump and Agriculture Secretary Perdue, USDA is committed to being a strong partner in deploying this critical infrastructure in Alaska and across all of America’s rural communities, because we know when rural America thrives, all of America thrives.”


Mukluk Telephone Company Inc. will use a $4.1 million ReConnect grant to deploy a fiber-to-the-premises network. This network will connect 641 people, 24 businesses, two public schools, two fire stations, two post offices and a city hall to high-speed broadband in Teller and Brevig Mission.


Matanuska Telephone Association Inc. will use a $1.9 million ReConnect grant to deploy a fiber-to-the-premises network. This network will connect 463 people to high-speed broadband in the Sheep Creek and Kashwitna areas of the Mat-Su Borough.


Arctic Slope Telephone Association Cooperative Inc. will use a $5.3 million ReConnect grant to deploy a fiber-to-the-premises network. This network will connect 239 people, 28 businesses, a public school and a post office to high-speed broadband in Kaktovik.


Background:


In March 2018, Congress provided $600 million to USDA to expand broadband infrastructure and services in rural America. On Dec. 13, 2018, Secretary Perdue announced the rules of the program, called “ReConnect,” including how the loans and grants will be awarded to help build broadband infrastructure in rural America.


On April 20, 2020, USDA announced the Department has received 172 applications for $1.57 billion in Round Two of the ReConnect Program. The second round will enable USDA to implement innovative new solutions to rural connectivity by leveraging financial options with our partners and continuing the success of the first round of funding. The application window for Round Two closed on April 15.


In Round One of the ReConnect Program, USDA invested $698 million to bring high-speed broadband e-Connectivity to approximately 167,000 households, 17,000 rural small businesses and farms, and more than 500 health care centers, educational facilities and critical community facilities located in 33 states.

USDA is an equal opportunity provider, employer and lender."
12-Nov-20,/media/press-releases/2020/11/12/usda-epa-welcome-two-new-members-us-food-loss-and-waste-2030,"USDA, EPA Welcome Two New Members as U.S. Food Loss and Waste 2030 Champions","(WASHINGTON, D.C., 
November 12, 2020)
 — Today, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Sonny Perdue and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Andrew Wheeler announced the addition of 
Meijer
, an American supercenter chain throughout the Midwest, and 
UNFI,
 a North America Food wholesaler, to the U.S. Food Loss and Waste 2030 Champions. Champions are U.S. businesses and organizations that pledge to reduce food loss and waste in their own operations by 50 percent by the year 2030. The commitment and action of these businesses will help the U.S. move closer to the national goal, protect and save valuable resources, and improve food system efficiencies while reducing waste.


“Businesses are leaders in innovation, and we applaud Meijer and UNFI for taking a leadership role in reducing food loss and waste,” 
said U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue
. “We encourage more manufacturers, grocers, restaurants, and other businesses to become U.S. Food Loss and Waste 2030 Champions.”


“Unfortunately, most of America’s current daily waste is in fact wasted food,” 
said EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler
. “We welcome Meijer and UNFI to our Food Loss and Waste 2030 Champions program. Their efforts and leadership will help us reach our national goal of reducing food loss and waste by 50 percent by 2030.”


“With millions of American families struggling every day to access sufficient, nutritious food, it is simply unacceptable that so much is wasted. We recognize the importance of collaboration as we work to address this challenge and are thrilled to join the U.S. Food Loss and Waste 2030 Champions to share best practices with others in our industry. As a critical link in the food supply, UNFI is committed to digging in to help find solutions,” 
said UNFI Director of Sustainability and Social Impact Alisha Real
.


Meijer and UNFI join the impressive list of existing 2030 Champions, which includes: Ahold Delhaize, Amazon, Aramark, Blue Apron, Bon Appetit, Browns Superstores, Campbells, Compass Group, ConAgra, Farmstead, General Mills, Giant Eagle, Hello Fresh, Hilton, Kellogg’s, Kroger, Las Vegas Sands, Marley Spoon, MGM Resorts, Mom’s Organic Market, Pepsico, Sodexo, Sprouts, The Wendy’s Company, Unilever, Walmart, Walt Disney World, Wegmans, Weis, Whitsons, and Yum! Brands.


Ongoing Federal Food Waste Reduction Efforts


USDA has taken significant steps to highlight the need to reduce food waste nationally. In October 2018, USDA, EPA, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) signed a formal agreement to align efforts across the federal government to educate consumers, engage stakeholders, and develop and evaluate solutions to food loss and waste. Earlier this year, the agencies updated the federal interagency strategy by listing contributing efforts in each of the priority action areas:




Priority Area 1: Enhance Interagency Coordination


Priority Area 2: Increase Consumer Education and Outreach Efforts


Priority Area 3: Improve Coordination and Guidance on Food Loss and Waste Measurement


Priority Area 4: Clarify and Communicate Information on Food Safety, Food Date Labels, and Food Donations


Priority Area 5: Collaborate with Private Industry to Reduce Food Loss and Waste Across the Supply Chain


Priority Area 6: Encourage Food Waste Reduction by Federal Agencies in their Respective Facilities

Background


Meeting the national goal of cutting food waste in half by 2030 will take a sustained commitment from everyone. Success requires action from the entire food system including the food industry, and the U.S. 2030 Food Loss and Waste Champions group can help lead the way.


Facts About Food Waste




The most recent available EPA data estimate that in 2017 more food (over 75 billion pounds) reached landfills and combustion facilities than any other material in everyday trash, constituting 22 percent of discarded municipal solid waste.


Landfills are the third largest source of human-related methane emissions in the United States.


Food waste not only impacts landfill space and emissions, it negatively impacts the economy. USDA estimates the value of food loss and waste for retailers and consumers each year to be over $161 billion.


Wasted food also results in unnecessary expenditures of U.S. domestic energy resources. Every time food is lost or wasted, all of the energy that went into producing that food is also wasted.
