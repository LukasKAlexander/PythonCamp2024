01/05/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-001.cfm,HUD Announces $10 Million in Capacity Building Grants for Rural America,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today awarded $10 million in capacity-building grants to five national non-profit organizations which will, in turn, fund rural housing development organizations, Community Development Corporations (CDCs), Community Housing Development Organizations (CHDOs), local governments, and Indian tribes (eligible beneficiaries) to carry out affordable housing and community development activities in rural areas for hard-working, low-income families and individuals.
Funded through HUD's Rural Capacity-Building for Affordable Housing and Community Development grant (RCB), these national intermediary organizations will support local eligible beneficiaries to spur affordable housing activities and community development in some of America's hardest hit rural communities. These national organizations will provide training, technical assistance, and financial support to these local beneficiaries, helping them serve hundreds of low-income or low- and moderate-income families and persons in rural areas.
""The RCB program demonstrates the importance of public and private partnerships to help our rural communities across America meet critical housing and community development needs,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson.
""Whether developing important organizational infrastructure, stimulating job creation, or strengthening small businesses, these grants help inspire public and private investment in rural areas that need resources to thrive. HUD is pleased to empower rural communities struggling to address economic uncertainty and unprecedented challenges,"" said HUD Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development John Gibbs.
The following organizations will receive RCB funds (see individual descriptions below):

01/14/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-002.cfm,HUD Secretary Ben Carson Introduces Find Shelter Tool to Help Community Members Locate Service Providers and Local Resources,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson today introduced the Find Shelter tool, a new resource developed by the Department to help individuals and families in need to locate nearby resources. Specifically, users can search for facilities that provide shelter, clothing, health clinics, and food pantries to those in need. Find Shelter provides mapping and contact information for these service providers and the site is optimized for mobile use.
""The Find Shelter website is another tool with which we can relieve homelessness and provide people with the resources they need,"" said Secretary Ben Carson. ""Particularly as we continue to recover from the coronavirus pandemic, it’s important to make sure individuals and families know where to go to get help.""
The tool is designed to help community members serve their neighbors in need. Particularly during the coronavirus pandemic there has been a surge in Neighbors Helping Neighbors across the country, which has been an important force in serving vulnerable Americans. The Find Shelter tool will only bolster this effort get people the help they need. The site includes downloadable, printable posters and palm cards that can be displayed near public computers for individuals and families looking to locate resources.
Research from HUD indicates that in 2019, most of the country experienced a combined decrease in homelessness, with the exception of significant increases in unsheltered and chronic homelessness on the West Coast, particularly in California and Oregon, offset those nationwide decreases, causing an overall increase in homelessness of 2.7 percent. HUD's 2019 Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress found that 567,715 persons experienced homelessness on a single night in 2019, an increase of 2.7 percent since 2018, but a nearly 11 percent decline since 2010. The number of families with children experiencing homelessness declined 5 percent from 2018 and more than 32 percent since 2010. Local communities also reported a continuing trend in reducing veteran homelessness across the country-the number of veterans experiencing homelessness fell 2.1 percent since January 2018 and by 50 percent since 2010."
01/14/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-003.cfm,HUD Reaches Agreement with Oklahoma Housing Providers for Alleged Religious Discrimination,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson announced today that the Department has reached a Conciliation Agreement with Vintage Housing, Inc., and Wilhoit Properties, Inc, the owner and manager of Cardinal Heights and Carriage Crossing senior apartments in Collinsville and Coweta, Oklahoma, resolving allegations that they removed bibles and christian reading material from the properties' common areas. Under the settlement, the housing providers agreed, among other things, to develop new policies regarding the display of religious materials for use in all the residences they manage or own and provide fair housing training for employees, with a portion dedicated to religious discrimination. Read the agreement.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in housing and in housing-related services based on religion and other protected characteristics. The complaint, filed on behalf of Secretary Carson in October 2020, followed a letter to HUD from a resident at the Carriage Crossing apartment complex who was upset that the property's management demanded the removal of religious material from common spaces.
""The Trump Administration is committed to ensuring that housing providers do not discriminate on the basis of religion under the Fair Housing Act,"" said Secretary Carson. ""This settlement lets housing providers know that barring religious materials, while allowing secular materials, infringes upon the rights of the people, and HUD will not stand for discrimination against any group for practicing their religious traditions.""
Persons who believe they have experienced housing discrimination may file a complaint of discrimination by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 or visiting How to File a Complaint on HUD's website. Materials and assistance are available for persons with limited English proficiency. Individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing may contact the Department using the Federal Relay Service at (800) 877-8339."
01/14/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-004.cfm,HUD Selects Thirty Public Housing Agencies to Join the Expansion of the Moving to Work (MTW) Demonstration Program,"WASHINGTON - Today, HUD announced the first thirty-one public housing agencies to join a small group of innovative agencies as part of the Moving to Work (MTW) demonstration program. Additionally, HUD is also inviting agencies interested in participating in this unique demonstration to submit applications for the third and fourth cohorts of the MTW Expansion. The selectees for the second cohort will be announced later this spring.
MTW is a demonstration program that enables public housing authorities to think outside the box by using their funding flexibly and developing creative solutions for serving vulnerable families in their communities. Through the expansion of the MTW demonstration, HUD will learn from MTW interventions in order to improve the delivery of federally assisted housing and promote self-sufficiency for low-income families across the nation.
MTW is key in moving away from a ""one-size-fits-all"" approach to affordable housing and allowing communities to effectively address the distinct issues they face. The locally tailored policies adopted by current and future MTW agencies will be a part of solving the challenges faced by all PHAs.
""At HUD, we believe that individuals know how to best govern their own lives. We have seen that giving PHAs flexibility to care for their vulnerable populations has led to excellent results for low-income families,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""The MTW Expansion allows PHAs to tailor services to fit their communities' unique needs, improving upon the outdated 'one-size-fits-all' approach to affordable housing. At the same time, HUD will evaluate specific policy changes so we can apply ""what works"" to other agencies and benefit families across the nation.""
Through the thirty-one agencies selected in this initial cohort, HUD will evaluate the overall impact of MTW flexibilities on PHAs with less than 1,000 units. Selected PHAs represent communities from across the nation, including: Auburn, Alabama; Fayetteville, Arkansas; Pocatello, Idaho; Ruston, Louisiana; Ripley, Missouri; Neptune, NJ; Rosenberg, Texas. In their own words, selected PHAs will use MTW designation in order to: offer encouragement in the form of incentives to help families work toward self-sufficiency and homeownership; establish emergency or transitional services to the homeless or otherwise hard to house; leverage financial flexibility to adequately fund all programs; develop creative partnerships with public and private collaborators; address mental health impediments of assisted residents; remove barriers that discourage income increases; achieve the highest level of internal operating efficiency; and much more. For a full list of the selectees in this initial cohort, please visit www.hud.gov/mtw.
Through the PHAs that will be selected through their third and fourth cohorts through the notices that were published today, HUD will learn whether work requirements promote self-sufficiency or how incentives could encourage landlords to participate in HUD's Housing Choice Voucher program.
The third cohort of the MTW Expansion will test the impact of implementing a work requirement policy on both the agency and the residents it serves. PHAs may choose to implement a work requirement policy in the public housing and/or voucher programs. In the third cohort, HUD seeks to balance the goal of allowing applicant PHAs maximum flexibility to design a work requirement policy while still ensuring that the policies across the PHAs are similar enough to support rigorous evaluation.
The fourth cohort of the MTW Expansion will evaluate landlord incentives and their effect on landlord participation in the HCV program. PHAs in the fourth cohort of the MTW Expansion must implement at least two MTW landlord incentive activities from a provided list of MTW landlord incentive activities. HUD will select PHAs for the fourth cohort of the MTW Expansion using a lottery, thereby establishing two groups: a ""treatment group"" of PHAs that join the fourth cohort of the MTW Expansion and a ""control group"" of PHAs that do not join the fourth cohort of the MTW Expansion. An independent research team will compare outcomes for the PHAs that were selected to join the fourth cohort of the MTW Expansion and the PHAs that do not join the fourth cohort of the MTW Expansion.
MTW is a demonstration program for PHAs that provides them the opportunity to design and test innovative, locally designed strategies that use Federal dollars more efficiently, help residents find employment and become self-sufficient, and increase housing choices for low-income families. MTW allows PHAs exemptions from many existing public housing and voucher rules and provides funding flexibility with how they use their Federal funds. PHAs in the MTW demonstration have pioneered a number of innovative policy interventions that have been proven to be successful at the local level, and subsequently rolled out to the rest of the country's PHAs.
Currently there are 39 MTW PHAs throughout the nation. In 2015, Congress allowed HUD to expand the MTW demonstration program to 100 additional PHAs over a seven year period.
The 100 new MTW PHAs will be added in several cohorts. Each cohort will experiment with a certain affordable housing policy, and HUD will study that specific policy change to learn what successful MTW innovations should be applied to all PHAs across the nation. The MTW Research Advisory Committee recommended the following policy changes that HUD will evaluate: MTW flexibilities, rent reform, work requirements, and landlord incentives.
Interested agencies should think about the types of policies they would like to implement as part of the MTW demonstration program. Examples of policies that have been implemented by agencies can be found on the MTW website: www.hud.gov/mtw
More information on how to apply can be found on HUD's website at www.hud.gov/mtw or PIH Notice 2021-02 and PIH Notice 2021-03. or you may contact the MTW office at: MTW-info@hud.gov."
01/19/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-005.cfm,HUD Finalizes Key Step in Expanding Availability of Affordable Manufacturing Housing,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development published a final rule (www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/01/12/2020-28227/manufactured-home-construction-and-safety-standards) on January 12, 2021 in the Federal Register which revises the federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974. The final rule represents the first substantive update to the Standards in almost a decade. The changes are designed to eliminate outdated regulatory barriers that have been an impediment to expanding the availability of this affordable housing type while protecting the safety of manufactured housing.
""This is another example of the sweeping changes this Administration has implemented to address the nation's affordable housing challenges,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""By eliminating the unnecessary red-tape barriers for manufactured housing, we're paving the way for more American families to benefit from the financial stability of homeownership.""
""Secretary Carson has been a champion of safe and affordable manufactured housing since he arrived at HUD. It's thanks to his leadership and dedication that today we have removed so many of the impediments to supplying this affordable homeownership option for the nation's working families,"" said Assistant Secretary for Housing Dana Wade.
The final rule includes removing the requirement for manufacturers to submit approval for certain alternative construction features and adding requirements for carbon monoxide alarms in manufactured housing. In addition, the rule:
Modernizes code provisions and allows for more optimal use of manufactured housing in urban areas, including Opportunity Zones; Adds provisions for manufactured homes designed for structures desired by consumers, such as attached garages and carports; and Includes provisions for design of attached manufactured homes such as zero-lot-line, townhome style housing, which increases design flexibility, reduces regulatory burden and expands consumer choice.

01/19/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-006.cfm,Economic Growth Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act: Implementation of National Standards for the Physical Inspection of Real Estate (NSPIRE),"WASHINGTON - Today the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) issued a proposed rule for the National Standards for the Physical Inspection of Real Estate (NSPIRE). This new approach incorporates extensive stakeholder input to redesign the methods HUD uses to ensure properties are in a safe, decent, and sanitary condition.
Since taking office, Secretary Carson led extensive housing reforms, placing the health and safety of affordable housing residents as an essential HUD priority. He emphasized the need for these changes after seeing firsthand the public housing inspection process. ""Despite us learning more as a society about the consequences of health and housing, the way HUD evaluates housing quality has basically remained unchanged for over twenty years. NSPIRE brings much needed updates to our programs and provides consistency to the families we serve. Families in HUD programs shouldn't have to worry about the safety or healthiness of their home depending on the program that's providing the assistance,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson.
To establish this new inspection approach, HUD assembled a team of talented researchers, scientists, academics, inspectors, analysts, and HUD professionals with decades of affordable housing inspection experience. By drawing on this experience, NSPIRE, as implemented by the new rule, will significantly enhance HUD's ability to focus on affordable housing properties that are not meeting quality expectations.
NSPIRE's approach improves processes directly impacting U.S. assisted, and affordable housing resources to provide decent, safe, and habitable homes for millions of transitioning and low-income families. The NSPIRE Rule https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/01/13/2021-00098/economic-growth-regulatory-relief-and-consumer-protection-act-implementation-of-national-standards strengthens HUD's affordable housing oversight. This includes the ability to identify substandard housing, streamline the current array of regulations, and reduce historically complex affordable housing procedures. The improvements demonstrated by the NSPIRE rule outline how HUD effectively evaluates housing across all HUD programs, ""having a singular set of standards allows us to have deeper insight into those conditions that impact families and the success of housing programs through defining common patterns and themes that might otherwise go undetected"" said HUD DAS David Vargas Real Estate Assessment Center (REAC).
Small and rural housing providers, for example, face unique challenges. As part of the overall set of regulatory changes being proposed in the NSPIRE rule, HUD would implement regulatory relief for small, rural housing providers to reduce unnecessary burdens and costs.
""Small and rural providers manage incredibly difficult processes, and this rule will allow them to see specific measurable changes to aid in improving effectiveness of inspections while reducing the operational burdens to manage these important processes,"" said PIH General Deputy Assistant Secretary Dominique Blom. NSPIRE components will fuse data and information from a large number of sources to determine areas to reduce risk and provides that information to decision makers and stakeholders so that they can take timely action to improve the conditions of the properties.
With NSPIRE, HUD's approach embraces a responsive model for program administration. The NSPIRE rule introduces an innovative and robust framework to ensure NSPIRE remains responsive to changes in the housing industry, stakeholder needs, and advances in technology. The provisions in the rule lay out regular and repeated input from stakeholders, including technical experts, leading to updates at least once every three years —including opportunities for public comments.
In line with Secretary Carson's vision, this rule fortifies HUD's deep commitment to millions of families that rely on HUD to constantly improve the processes of assessing property conditions and to ensure tenants have healthy and habitable homes. This responsive model would place the most focus on residents, their safety, and their units. It stresses the importance of eliminating safety and health hazards from homes and enhances the reliability of our assessments. The NSPIRE people-first approach encourages stronger communication and collaboration between residents and owners through regular and consistent feedback for significant improvements now and far into the future.
HUD seeks public comment on all aspects of the proposed rule. To be considered, comments should be submitted in accordance with guidance published in the Federal Register notice. The Proposed Rule is available for review and feedback at https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/01/13/2021-00098/economic-growth-regulatory-relief-and-consumer-protection-act-implementation-of-national-standards. It is open to comments until 03/15/2021."
01/19/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-007.cfm,HUD Awards $4.4 Million for Carbon Monoxide Detectors in Public Housing,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary, Ben Carson today awarded an additional $4.4 million under the Capital Fund Emergency Safety and Security Program to 58 public housing agencies (PHA) for the purchase and installation of carbon monoxide (CO) detectors in public housing units where they are necessary. This is in addition to the $5 million already awarded to 59 PHAs for carbon monoxide detectors in March 2020. In less than one year, HUD has awarded a total $9.4 in Capital Fund Emergency Safety and Security Program funding to 117 PHAs for the purchase and installation of carbon monoxide detectors.
""Since I started at HUD, we have been committed to ensuring the health and wellbeing of all Americans living in public housing,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""The threat of carbon monoxide poisoning can be effectively eliminated by the installation of a CO detector. These grants will enable public housing agencies across the country to install CO detectors and keep our neighbors safe.""
HUD added the purchase and installation of carbon monoxide detectors as an eligible cost under the Capital Fund Emergency Safety and Security Program in FY 2019, recognizing the need for specific funding for this purpose. Carbon monoxide is a byproduct of fuel-fired combustion appliances, such as furnaces and water heaters. If not properly vented, this undetectable gas can be dangerous and even deadly.
The following public housing authorities will receive grant awards in January 2021. Read individual project descriptions."
01/21/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-008.cfm,Biden Administration Authorizes Extension of Federal Housing Administration Single Family Foreclosure and Eviction Moratorium,"WASHINGTON - Yesterday, the Biden Administration requested the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and other Federal Agencies to extend its foreclosure and eviction moratorium for single family mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or guaranteed by the Office of Native American Programs' Section 184 and 184A loan guarantee programs through March 31, 2021. Today, HUD executed one of the first Administration actions to provide meaningful support to the nation's individuals and families who are struggling to make their mortgage payments due to the financial devastation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
""As President Biden promised, his new Administration is quickly addressing the widespread needs of a nation that is in urgent need of meaningful assistance to begin combatting the effects of COVID-19,"" said Acting Federal Housing Commissioner Janet Golrick. ""Immediately safeguarding borrowers with HUD-insured or guaranteed mortgages is an important first step in tackling larger, systemic housing challenges that must be overcome.""
The moratorium prohibits servicers from initiating or proceeding with foreclosure and foreclosure-related eviction actions for HUD insured or guaranteed single family forward and reverse mortgages, except for those secured by legally vacant and abandoned properties. Further, HUD requires mortgage servicers to provide up to six months of COVID-19 forbearance when a borrower experiencing a financial hardship due to COVID-19 requests this assistance, and up to an additional six months of COVID-19 forbearance for a borrower who requests an extension of the initial forbearance.
HUD encourages borrowers with HUD-insured or guaranteed mortgages who can make their mortgage payments to continue to do so. Those who are struggling financially because of COVID-19 should engage with their mortgage servicer – the entity to which they make their monthly mortgage payments. HUD provides post-COVID-19 forbearance loss mitigation options to assist borrowers with bringing their mortgage current.
Borrowers with FHA-insured mortgages seeking additional information on available options should visit FHA's COVID-19 Resources for Homeowners web page on FHA.gov. Borrowers with mortgages guaranteed under the Section 184 or Section 184A programs seeking additional information on available options should visit HUD's COVID-19 Resources for Native Americans web page.

""President Biden asked the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to consider an immediate extension of eviction and foreclosure moratoriums on federally-backed single family mortgages. In order to provide much-needed economic relief and support to working families, HUD has implemented the President's requests.
""Millions of Americans are at risk of eviction or foreclosure because of the COVID-19 pandemic and corresponding economic crisis, and the Biden Administration is pursuing a comprehensive strategy to prevent widespread housing loss. As we have seen throughout the pandemic, this looming wave of evictions and foreclosures disproportionately impacts communities of color. These executive actions are a critical first step to ensure that families hit hard by the economic crisis will not be forced from their homes during their time of need.
""Specifically, HUD has extended the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) eviction and foreclosure moratorium until March 31, 2021 and extended the Public and Indian Housing (PIH) eviction and foreclosure moratorium until March 31, 2021.
""Failing to prevent widespread evictions and foreclosures would lead to untold hardship for families and to overwhelmed emergency shelter capacity, increasing the likelihood of COVID-19 spread in our communities. The Biden Administration is committed to using the tools at its disposal and to working with Congress to help struggling households keep a roof over their heads. These agency actions support the Administration's broader strategy by immediately extending nationwide restrictions on evictions and foreclosures."""

""HUD and the new administration are quickly addressing the urgent housing needs of a nation combating the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic,"" said Acting HUD Secretary Matthew E. Ammon. ""And, in just the first week of the Biden Administration, HUD has taken a number of critical actions to strengthen the department and to provide a foundation for a more equitable housing system that is needed for our nation to build back better and expand opportunity for all.""
First Week Accomplishments
Extension of eviction and foreclosure moratoriums
HUD implemented President Biden's requests to immediately extend eviction and foreclosure moratoriums on federally-backed single family mortgages through March 31, 2021, to provide meaningful support to homeowners struggling financially as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Extension of forbearance request deadline
The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) announced that it will execute the Biden Administration's request to extend the deadline for borrowers with FHA-insured mortgages who are struggling financially due to COVID-19 to request and receive mortgage payment forbearance from their mortgage servicer. The new deadline is March 31, 2021, allowing borrowers additional time to request and obtain up to six months of an initial pause in their mortgage payments.
Redressing discriminatory housing practices and policies
HUD committed to working with President Biden and his administration to redress the federal government's legacy of housing discrimination and to securing equal access to housing opportunity for all.
Tackling the climate crisis
HUD committed to making the necessary investments in communities disproportionally impacted by the effects of climate change to ensure more sustainable, safe, and affordable housing in communities that need it most.
Tribal consultation and strengthening Nation-to-Nation relationships
HUD committed to implementing President Biden's Memorandum on Tribal consultation and strengthening Nation-to-Nation relationships and to continuing its critical work to meet the housing needs of Tribal Nations.
Secretary-Designate Marcia L. Fudge's Senate nomination hearing
HUD Secretary-Designate Marcia L. Fudge appeared before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Development for her nomination hearing: ""It bears mentioning, particularly in this moment of crisis, that HUD - perhaps more than any other department - exists to serve the most vulnerable people in America. That mandate matters a great deal to me. It is consistent with my own values, and it is precisely what has always motivated me to service.""
New leadership appointees
HUD Chief of Staff Jenn Jones announced a slate of new HUD leadership appointees: ""These last four years have tested our faith in our government, our democracy and at times, our humanity. This experienced team is hard at work alongside fellow career staff to rebuild the department and to increase equitable access to housing for millions of families. With their vast expertise and knowledge and their unwavering commitment to serving the American people, this team will play a vital role in the Biden Administration's ambitious agenda to build back better."""
01/29/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-017.cfm,HUD Renews Funding for Thousands of Local Homeless Programs,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today awarded $2.5 billion to renew support to thousands of local homeless assistance programs across the nation. HUD's Continuum of Care (CoC) grants will provide critically needed support to 6,597 local programs on the front lines of serving individuals and families experiencing homelessness. See local impact of funding below.
Due to the pandemic, the funding announced today renews grants for existing programs. This process was dramatically streamlined because communities have been and will continue to be consumed with COVID-19 response and have limited capacity to participate in the traditional CoC competition.
""HUD wants to ensure that thousands of local homeless assistance providers continue to receive federal funds needed to provide stable housing for people experiencing homelessness during these trying times,"" said Acting HUD Secretary Matt Ammon. ""Renewing these grants not only offers relief to our local partners but it allows Continuums of Care to continue their work to end homelessness and help keep our most vulnerable neighbors off the streets.""
""We are excited about the opportunity to provide funding without diverting the attention of communities from the vital work of preventing, preparing for, and responding to the pandemic,"" said James Arthur Jemison, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development.
HUD's Continuum of Care grant funding supports a broad array of interventions designed to assist individuals and families experiencing homelessness, particularly those living in places not meant for habitation, located in sheltering programs, or at imminent risk of experiencing homeless. Each year, HUD serves more than a million people through emergency shelter, transitional, and permanent housing programs.

01/29/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-018.cfm,HUD and Census Bureau Report New Residential Sales in December 2020,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Census Bureau jointly announced the following new residential sales statistics for December 2020:

New Home Sales
Sales of new single-family houses in December 2020 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 842,000. This is 1.6 percent (±15.8 percent)* above the revised November rate of 829,000 and is 15.2 percent (±17.2 percent)* above the December 2019 estimate of 731,000.
Sales Price
The median sales price of new houses sold in December 2020 was $355,900. The average sales price was $394,900.
For Sale Inventory and Month's Supply
The seasonally-adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of December was 302,000. This represents a supply of 4.3 months at the current sales rate.

EXPLANATORY NOTES
These statistics are estimated from sample surveys. They are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated average relative standard errors of the preliminary data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. Changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show irregular movement. It takes 4 months to establish a trend for new houses sold. Preliminary new home sales figures are subject to revision due to the survey methodology and definitions used. The survey is primarily based on a sample of houses selected from building permits. Since a ""sale"" is defined as a deposit taken or sales agreement signed, this can occur prior to a permit being issued. An estimate of these prior sales is included in the sales figure. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimate of total sales is revised about 4.3 percent. Changes in sales price data reflect changes in the distribution of houses by region, size, etc., as well as changes in the prices of houses with identical characteristics. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at Census Bureau's website (www.census.gov/construction/nrs/how_the_data_are_collected/index.html)."
02/02/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-015.cfm,HUD and Puerto Rico Housing Department Announce New Action to Enable Stronger Recovery for the Island,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and Puerto Rico's housing department, Departamento de la Vivienda, today announced two partial approvals of Vivienda's Action Plan, approving the use of $6.2 billion in Community Development Block Grant Mitigation (CDBG-MIT) funding for Puerto Rico.
""HUD and the Biden Administration are committed to working with Puerto Rico to reset our relationship on the island's recovery efforts, and the action we are taking will play a key role in this effort by ensuring that Puerto Rico is able to access and spend critical disaster and recovery funds on urgent unmet needs,"" said Arthur Jemison, HUD's Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Office of Community Planning and Development.
On January 20, 2021, HUD, under the previous administration, issued a Partial Approval of Puerto Rico's Annual Action Plan worth more than $4.9 billion. This Partial Approval carried with it conditions on Puerto Rico's CDBG-MIT funds. Under the new Administration, HUD and the Departamento de la Vivienda are committed to resetting the relationship and accelerating access to promised reconstruction and resilience funding while ensuring transparency and accountability. HUD is working to remove onerous conditions placed on the more than $20 billion of CDBG-DR and CDBG-MIT funds allocated to Puerto Rico, which are unique to Puerto Rico, to free up these long-promised funds and bring the relationship in line with other jurisdictions.
Further, the Partial Approval required HUD's Office of Community Planning and Development (CPD) to take an action by February 1, 2021, or have the burdensome terms and conditions of the Plan further codified, and thus difficult to amend.
Working in consultation with Vivienda's leadership, on February 1, 2021, HUD CPD approved several new elements of the Plan, giving access to another $1.3 billion in CDBG-MIT funding. At the suggestion of Vivienda, HUD CPD issued technical disapproval to an aspect of the Action Plan, giving the organization both the time to make minor changes in the Plan and the window to work with HUD to remove the conditions previously imposed. This action enables Vivienda and HUD to reset their relationship on Puerto Rico's disaster recovery and to eliminate the red tape that prevents faster recovery.
Specifically, HUD's action gives Vivienda access to an additional $1.3 billion, for a total of $6.2 billion under the Action Plan, and creates the opportunity for Vivienda and HUD to remove the onerous conditions in the previous administration's Partial Approval and Grant Agreement that are holding back progress by slowing the housing department's access to the funds. By giving Vivienda additional time to enhance its housing plan, HUD will have the necessary time to work with Vivienda to remove oversight impediments, while allowing the $6.2 billion to go to work on the island immediately."
02/02/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-015sp.cfm,HUD y el Departamento de la Vivienda de Puerto Rico Anuncian Medida Para Hacer Posible una Recuperación Firme para la Isla,"WASHINGTON - El Departamento de Vivienda y Desarrollo Urbano de los Estados Unidos (HUD) y el Departamento de la Vivienda de Puerto Rico (Vivienda) anunciaron hoy dos aprobaciones parciales del Plan de Acción presentado por Vivienda, aprobando el uso de $6,200 millones en fondos del programa de Desarrollo Comunitario con Subsidio para Mitigación (CDBG-MIT) de Puerto Rico.
""HUD y la Administración Biden están comprometidos a trabajar con Puerto Rico para reiniciar nuestra relación con los esfuerzos de recuperación de la isla. La acción que estamos tomando hoy tendrá un papel preponderante en este esfuerzo para asegurar que Puerto Rico tenga la capacidad de acceder y ejecutar los fondos de desastre y recuperación, críticos para las urgentes necesidades pendientes en la isla"", dijo Arthur Jemison, Subsecretario Principal Adjunto de la Oficina de Planificación y Desarrollo Urbano de HUD.
El 20 de enero de 2021, HUD, bajo la administración anterior, emitió una Aprobación Parcial del Plan de Acción de Puerto Rico por un valor superior a los $4,900 millones. Esta Aprobación Parcial imponía condiciones para los fondos CDBG-MIT de Puerto Rico. Bajo la nueva Administración, HUD y el Departamento de la Vivienda están comprometidos a reiniciar la relación y acelerar el acceso a los fondos de reconstrucción y resiliencia prometidos, asegurando transparencia y responsabilidad. HUD está trabajando para retirar las onerosas condiciones impuestas a los más de $20,000 millones en fondos CDBG-DR y CDBG-MIT asignados a Puerto Rico, condiciones únicas para Puerto Rico, para así liberar estos fondos largamente prometidos y alinear la relación de manera semejante a otras jurisdicciones.
Aún más, la Aprobación Parcial exigía que la oficina de HUD de Planificación y Desarrollo Comunitario (CPD por sus siglas en inglés) actuara el primero de febrero de 2021 o reglamentara aún más los arduos términos y condiciones del Plan, haciéndolos más difíciles de enmendar.
Trabajando en conjunto con el liderazgo de Vivienda, el primero de febrero de 2021 la oficina de CPD de HUD aprobó nuevos elementos del plan, otorgando acceso a otros $1,300 millones de los fondos CDBG-MIT. A sugerencia de Vivienda, el equipo CPD de HUD emitió una desaprobación técnica de un aspecto del Plan de Acción, para brindarle a la organización el tiempo para realizar ajustes menores al plan, y un intervalo para trabajar con HUD para remover las condiciones anteriormente impuestas. Esta acción les permite a Vivienda y HUD reiniciar su relación en la recuperación del desastre en Puerto Rico y eliminar trámites burocráticos que impiden una recuperación más rápida.
Específicamente, la acción de HUD le da a Vivienda acceso a $1,300 millones adicionales, para un total de $6,200 millones bajo su Plan de Acción, y crea la oportunidad para que Vivienda pueda remover las excesivas condiciones de la administración anterior en su Aprobación Parcial y Acuerdo de Subsidio que ha retrasado el progreso al desacelerar el acceso del Departamento de la Vivienda a los fondos. Al otorgarle tiempo adicional para mejorar su plan de vivienda, HUD tendrá el tiempo necesario para trabajar con Vivienda para remover los impedimentos de supervisión, mientras permite que los $6,200 millones lleguen a la isla de inmediato."
02/03/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-019.cfm,"Federal Housing Administration Issues Measures to Protect Health, Safety, and Homeownership Security of Borrowers Impacted by COVID-19","WASHINGTON - Today, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) issued a series of waivers of provisions in its Single Family Housing Policy Handbook 4000.1 that would normally require in-person contact between mortgage servicers and borrowers, including seniors with FHA-insured Home Equity Conversion (HECM) reverse mortgages. These waivers allow important mortgage servicing activities to continue, but in a manner that allows for safe social distancing to help combat the COVID-19 pandemic.
""President Biden has made it clear that protecting the health, safety, and homeownership security of the nation's most vulnerable populations, including seniors, are urgent and immediate priorities,"" said Acting HUD Secretary Matthew Ammon. ""The policy waivers issued today are another important step in addressing these priorities.""
Specifically, the waivers issued today build upon previous waivers and put in place the following provisions through December 31, 2021:
Allowing alternative methods for servicers to conduct borrower interviews for FHA-insured forward and HECM mortgages when performing early default interventions for borrowers in danger of foreclosure; Waiving the $5,000 property charge payment arrearages cap on recalculated repayment plans, allowing servicers to help more HECM borrowers who are behind on their property charge payments; and Eliminating the requirement for servicers to obtain a signature on an occupancy certification from a HECM borrower.
• Allowing alternative methods for servicers to conduct borrower interviews for FHA-insured forward and HECM mortgages when performing early default interventions for borrowers in danger of foreclosure;
• Waiving the $5,000 property charge payment arrearages cap on recalculated repayment plans, allowing servicers to help more HECM borrowers who are behind on their property charge payments; and
• Eliminating the requirement for servicers to obtain a signature on an occupancy certification from a HECM borrower.
The waivers issued today augment FHA's actions last week to execute on President Biden's ""Day One"" request to provide urgent and immediate support to the nation's homeowners struggling to make their mortgage payments due to COVID-19. To execute the President's Day One request, FHA extended its foreclosure and eviction moratorium for borrowers with FHA-insured single family mortgages through March 31, 2021. FHA also extended the deadline for borrowers financially impacted by COVID-19 to request a new forbearance from their mortgage servicer through March 31, 2021.
FHA encourages borrowers with FHA-insured mortgages who can make their mortgage payments to continue to do so. Borrowers with FHA-insured mortgages seeking additional information on available options should visit FHA's COVID-19 Resources for Homeowners web page on FHA.gov. Other borrowers are encouraged to visit the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's Coronavirus Mortgage and Housing Assistance (www.consumerfinance.gov/coronavirus/mortgage-and-housing-assistance/) web pages."
02/09/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-020.cfm,HUD Charges Missouri Housing Provider with Discriminating Against Applicant with a Disability,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is charging Dahms Investments, LLC, the owner of duplex apartments in Hamilton, Missouri, and their property manager, with violating the Fair Housing Act by refusing to grant a prospective tenant with a mental health disability a reasonable accommodation to waive the required pet deposit for her assistance animal.
HUD's charge specifically alleges that the property manager told the woman that she would have to pay hundreds of dollars in pet fees and that she did not look like she had a disability. The charge further alleges that the property manager told the woman that rules related to assistance animals only applied to individuals who are blind and/or deaf. Read HUD's charge.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from denying or limiting housing to people with disabilities, or from refusing to make reasonable accommodations in policies or practices when necessary to provide persons with disabilities an equal opportunity to use or enjoy a dwelling. Prohibitions include not allowing people with disabilities to have assistance animals that perform work or tasks, or that provide disability-related emotional support.
""It's not a housing provider's role to determine who does or does not need an assistance animal,"" said Jeanine Worden, HUD's Acting Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Today's action demonstrates HUD's commitment to ensuring that the owners and managers of rental properties comply with the nation's housing laws.""
""Individuals with disabilities have a right to be granted accommodations they need to enjoy housing, including the use of an assistance animal,"" said Damon Smith, HUD's Principal Deputy General Counsel. ""HUD is committed to making sure housing is equally available for tenants with disabilities.""
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party elects for the case to be heard in federal court. If, after a hearing, the administrative law judge finds that discrimination has occurred, the judge may award damages to the complainant for her losses that have resulted from the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties in order to vindicate the public interest.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 877-8339 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to hud.gov/fairhousing."
02/11/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-021.cfm,HUD to Enforce Fair Housing Act to Prohibit Discrimination on the Basis of Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced that it will administer and enforce the Fair Housing Act to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.
HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (FHEO) issued a memorandum stating that HUD interprets the Fair Housing Act to bar discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity and directing HUD offices and recipients of HUD funds to enforce the Act accordingly. The memorandum begins implementation of the policy set forth in President Biden's Executive Order 13988 on Preventing and Combating Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity or Sexual Orientation (www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-preventing-and-combating-discrimination-on-basis-of-gender-identity-or-sexual-orientation/) (Executive Order), which directed executive branch agencies to examine further steps that could be taken to combat such discrimination.
""Housing discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity demands urgent enforcement action,"" said Acting Assistant Secretary of FHEO, Jeanine M. Worden. ""That is why HUD, under the Biden Administration, will fully enforce the Fair Housing Act to prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation. Every person should be able to secure a roof over their head free from discrimination, and the action we are taking today will move us closer to that goal.""
The significance of this action is underscored by a number of housing discrimination studies which indicate that same-sex couples and transgender persons in communities across the country experience demonstrably less favorable treatment than their straight and cisgender counterparts when seeking rental housing. Despite this reality, the Department has been constrained in its efforts to address housing discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity by legal uncertainty about whether most such discrimination was within HUD's reach.
The memorandum relies on the Department's legal conclusion that the Fair Housing Act's sex discrimination provisions are comparable in text and purpose to those of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which bars sex discrimination in the workplace. In Bostock v Clayton County, the Supreme Court held that workplace prohibitions on sex discrimination include discrimination because of sexual orientation and gender identity. HUD has now determined that the Fair Housing Act's prohibition on sex discrimination in housing likewise includes discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. Accordingly, and consistent with President Biden's Executive Order, HUD will enforce the Fair Housing Act to prevent and combat such discrimination.
""Enforcing the Fair Housing Act to combat housing discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity isn't just the right thing to do-it's the correct reading of the law after Bostock,"" said Damon Y. Smith, Principal Deputy General Counsel. ""We are simply saying that the same discrimination that the Supreme Court has said is illegal in the workplace is also illegal in the housing market.""
The memorandum directs actions by HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity and HUD-funded fair housing partners to enforce the Fair Housing Act to prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation. Specifically, the memorandum directs the following:
HUD will accept and investigate all jurisdictional complaints of sex discrimination, including discrimination because of gender identity or sexual orientation, and enforce the Fair Housing Act where it finds such discrimination occurred. HUD will conduct all activities involving the application, interpretation, and enforcement of the Fair Housing Act's prohibition on sex discrimination consistent with its conclusion that such discrimination includes discrimination because of sexual orientation and gender identity. State and local jurisdictions funded by HUD's Fair Housing Assistance Program (FHAP) that enforce the Fair Housing Act through their HUD-certified substantially equivalent laws will be required to administer those laws to prohibit discrimination because of gender identity and sexual orientation. Organizations and agencies that receive grants through the Department's Fair Housing Initiative Program (FHIP) must carry out their funded activities to also prevent and combat discrimination because of sexual orientation and gender identity. FHEO Regional Offices, FHAP agencies, and FHIP grantees are instructed to review, within 30 days, all records of allegations (inquiries, complaints, phone logs, etc.) received since January 20, 2020, and notify persons who alleged discrimination because of gender identity or sexual orientation that their claims may be timely and jurisdictional for filing under this memorandum.
• HUD will accept and investigate all jurisdictional complaints of sex discrimination, including discrimination because of gender identity or sexual orientation, and enforce the Fair Housing Act where it finds such discrimination occurred.
• HUD will conduct all activities involving the application, interpretation, and enforcement of the Fair Housing Act's prohibition on sex discrimination consistent with its conclusion that such discrimination includes discrimination because of sexual orientation and gender identity.

Here's what they're saying about HUD's directive to enforce the Fair Housing Act to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity:
Senator Sherrod Brown: ""No one should be excluded from housing based on who they are or who they love. I applaud the Biden Administration for taking steps to ensure that HUD is finally carrying out the Bostock ruling's confirmation that civil rights protections extend to sexual orientation and gender identity."" [Statement (www.banking.senate.gov/newsroom/majority/brown-discrimination-has-no-place-in-our-housing-system), 2/11/21]

Senator Tim Kaine: ""To this day, many LGBTQ+ Americans are turned away from housing opportunities because of who they love. I've seen firsthand the impact housing can have on a family's health and economic prospects. It's long past time we end this discrimination and ensure all Americans have equal access to housing. I'm pleased to see the Biden Administration take immediate action to protect the rights of more Americans as they find a home."" [Statement, 2/11/2021]
Equality Caucus Chair Congressman David N. Cicilline: ""No person should ever lose their home because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. It is un-American. I am pleased that HUD is taking action today to crack down on discrimination against LGBTQ+ people. This is a big step in the right direction, and I thank President Biden for his leadership on this important issue. LGBTQ+ people should be able to live their lives free from the fear of discrimination, regardless of which party controls the White House. That's why, in the weeks ahead, it is critical that Congress pass the Equality Act to establish permanent federal protections against discrimination in housing, education, employment, and other key areas of day-to-day life. I look forward to working with the President and my colleagues to get the job done."" [Statement, 2/11/21]
Equality Caucus Co-Chair Congresswoman Angie Craig: ""I am encouraged by today's announcement, which reaffirms that discrimination in the housing market on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity is unreasonable, immoral and illegal. This action is another step in a long march toward unraveling a pattern of discrimination against LGBTQ Americans enacted by the Trump Administration. While we still have a long way to go, I am proud to have President Biden and his Administration standing alongside us in our ongoing fight for equality."" [Statement, 2/11/21]
Equality Caucus Co-Chair Congresswoman Sharice L. Davids: ""I am thrilled that HUD took an important step today to fully enforce the Fair Housing Act and prevent discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in federally funded housing programs. No one should be discriminated against because of who they love or how they identity - but sadly this happens all too frequently. That is why we must finally get the Equality Act signed into law, so we can outlaw this kind of discrimination in every part of our society, not just in our federally funded programs. While we celebrate this progress in the fight for LGBTQ equality, we must also recommit to the work that still lies ahead."" [Statement, 2/11/21]
Equality Caucus Co-Chair Congressman Mondaire Jones: ""For years, so many LGBTQ+ people in this country have been housing-insecure because of the systems put in place to discriminate against us. Finding a place to live is hard enough and we should not have to deal with the additional hurdle of navigating a minefield of discrimination. Everyone deserves to feel safe at home."" [Statement, 2/11/21]
Equality Caucus Co-Chair Congressman Sean Patrick Maloney: ""Stable, safe housing for LGBTQ people isn't a 'nice to have', it's a 'need to have'. This is the right move by the Biden Administration, and it shows the president's strong commitment to equality for LGBTQ people. Today's decision is just the beginning. Working in lock-step with the White House, I will continue our fight to codify nondiscrimination protections for all LGBTQ Americans through the advancement of the Equality Act."" [Statement, 2/11/21]
Equality Caucus Co-Chair Congressman Chris Pappas: ""Safe and affordable housing is a fundamental human right, and I am thrilled to see the Department of Housing and Urban Development take action and prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation. The Biden Administration has made it a priority to prevent and combat discrimination throughout the federal government, and I commend them for their efforts to ensure every American receives equal treatment under the law."" [Statement, 2/11/21]
Equality Caucus Co-Chair Congressman Mark Pocan: ""No one should be denied a home because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Only 22 states and the District of Columbia have explicit laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, so it is long overdue that we take federal action to enforce the Fair Housing Act for LGBTQ+ communities. At a time when so many across the nation are on the brink of homelessness and housing insecurity, we thank the Biden-Harris administration for moving swiftly to remove further obstacles to those seeking housing during this crisis. Next, Congress must pass the Fair and Equal Housing Act to make President Biden's executive order the law of the land once and for all."" [Statement, 2/11/21]
Congressman David Price: ""@HUDgov says discrimination based on sexuality or gender identity violates the Fair Housing Act. This sends a powerful signal that bias has no place in housing or emergency shelter."" [Tweet (https://twitter.com/RepDavidEPrice/status/1360003145573797888), 2/11/21]
Equality Caucus Co-Chair Congressman Mark Takano: ""LGBTQ+ people are more likely to experience housing insecurity or homelessness, and rampant discrimination and economic inequality makes it harder for members of our community to secure a place to live. By administering and enforcing the Fair Housing Act to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, the Biden Administration is taking a major step toward combating discrimination against LGBTQ+ Americans. No one should ever be denied housing because of their identity and those who face discrimination deserve the same legal protections as everyone else. I applaud this monumental move, now let's pass the Equality Act to codify these legal protections and guarantee true equality under the law for every American."" [Statement, 2/11/21]
Congressman Mike Quigley: ""Today's announcement, in the first weeks of the Biden administration, is a declaration that LGBTQ rights are human rights and that housing discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation is unacceptable and should be relegated to the shameful past.""

02/16/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-023.cfm,HUD Announces Extensions and Expansions of COVID-19 Homeowner Relief and Home Retention Measures,"WASHINGTON - To provide urgent economic relief to homeowners impacted by COVID-19, today the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced extensions of the Federal Housing Administration's (FHA) foreclosure and eviction moratoriums, as well as an extension of the initial start date of a COVID-19 Forbearance. Forbearance is an option mortgage servicers use to provide homeowners with a pause to their monthly payments for a limited period of time during a COVID-19 induced hardship.
The FHA has extended the length of forbearance for some borrowers, and will allow more borrowers access to COVID-19 loss mitigation options. These measures will provide relief to the nation's homeowners with FHA-insured single family mortgages who continue to suffer financially because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Additionally, the Office of Public and Indian Housing is planning to announce similar relief for Native American and Native Hawaiian homeowners assisted under the Section 184 Indian Home Loan Guarantee Program and the Section 184A Native Hawaiian Housing Loan Guarantee Program.
HUD's actions align with President Biden's priority to provide economic relief and support (www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/legislation/2021/01/20/president-biden-announces-american-rescue-plan) to working families by providing urgently-needed housing relief for homeowners and renters.
""As President Biden has made clear, it is urgent that we help homeowners throughout the nation who are struggling financially from this unprecedented national emergency,"" said Acting HUD Secretary Matthew Ammon. ""The steps we are taking today will provide both immediate relief to those in desperate need of assistance and help more homeowners keep their homes and resume their payments when the pandemic subsides.""
The extension of the foreclosure and eviction moratoriums applies to all homeowners with an FHA-insured forward or Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) loan, and homeowners with a Section 184 or Section 184A mortgage loan, except for properties that are legally vacant or abandoned, through June 30, 2021. HUD prohibits servicers from initiating or proceeding with foreclosure and foreclosure-related eviction actions during the moratoriums. HUD also extended the deadlines for the first legal action and reasonable diligence timeframes for servicers to 180 days from the date of expiration of the foreclosure and eviction moratorium.
To address the ongoing need to expand mortgage payment assistance solutions for homeowners, for all FHA-insured forward mortgages, today HUD:
Extended the timeframe for homeowners to request the start of a COVID-19 Forbearance from their mortgage servicer through June 30, 2021. This extension provides homeowners with additional time to request a forbearance from their mortgage servicer. Expanded the COVID-19 Forbearance to allow up to two forbearance extensions of up to three months each for homeowners who requested a COVID-19 Forbearance on or before June 30, 2020. These additional forbearance extensions will provide relief to homeowners in this situation who will be nearing the end of their maximum 12-month forbearance period and have not yet stabilized their financial situation. Expanded the use of FHA's streamlined COVID-19 loss mitigation home retention and home disposition options to all homeowners who are behind on their mortgage payments by at least 90 days. This expansion will require mortgage servicers to assess more homeowners for a streamlined waterfall of loss mitigation home retention options, starting with FHA's COVID-19 Standalone Partial Claim.

To assist seniors with HECMs, FHA has extended the timeframe for the start of an initial COVID-19 HECM extension through June 30, 2021. For HECMs that entered an initial extension period on or before June 30, 2020, up to two additional three-month extension periods are available.
HUD urges all homeowners who are able to make their mortgage payments to continue to do so. However, homeowners who need COVID-19 mortgage payment assistance should contact their mortgage servicer immediately or consider contacting a HUD-approved housing counseling agency. Homeowners may also visit HUD's Coronavirus Relief for Homeowners web page or HUD's COVID-19 Resources for Native Americans webpage for additional information and resources.

02/16/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-024.cfm,HUD Announces $38.8 Million in Loan Guarantee Assistance to the District of Columbia for Affordable Housing Projects,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced that the Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) in Washington, DC will receive a $38.8 million loan guaranteed by HUD to fund a variety of affordable housing rehabilitation projects that will preserve and increase the number of affordable units in the District.
The funding announced today is guaranteed through HUD's Section 108 Loan Guarantee Program (Section 108), which provides local governments with a public investment tool to help renew communities and catalyze development in underserved areas. Section 108 provides access to low cost, flexible financing that can serve as the public commitment often needed to inspire private investment to further stimulate community development in distressed areas.
""These guaranteed loans will help to develop and preserve affordable housing to serve low-income families in Washington, DC,"" said James Arthur Jemison, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development. ""Today's funding announcement demonstrates HUD's commitment to working collaboratively with communities to help revitalize neighborhoods and realize their priorities.""
""We thank President Biden and his Administration for approving this investment in much-needed affordable housing for DC residents. Building back better and ensuring an equitable recovery means working together across every level of government to meet the needs of those who have been hit hardest by the pandemic and the economic crisis it caused. We know that for many Washingtonians, access to safe and affordable housing is the first step to getting back on their feet,"" said Mayor Muriel Bowser. ""As we continue through our response and recovery, this funding will allow us to double down on our ongoing housing efforts, protect DC's stock of affordable housing, and give more Washingtonians a fair shot.""
DHCD is using Section 108 guaranteed loan funds to establish an affordable housing rehabilitation loan fund that will provide third-party loans for the preservation of housing for households earning up to 80 percent of the area median family income. The loan fund will be established to expand the DHCD's financing capacity, enabling preservation of additional affordable housing in the District of Columbia.
Additionally, these loan funds will rehabilitate owner-occupied affordable housing and existing affordable rental properties that will use Low Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC) and Limited Equity Cooperatives that typically have difficulty securing competitive financing terms from the private market. Loans for both types of projects will be made to qualified for-profit and nonprofit developers with eligible affordable housing projects."

02/22/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-027.cfm,HUD Charges Rhode Island Housing Provider with Discriminating Against Families with Children,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is charging D&D Realty Management, LLC, in Providence, Rhode Island, the owner and manager of several rental properties in that city, with violating the Fair Housing Act by refusing to rent to families with children. HUD's charge alleges that the owners stated that they cannot have children at the property and refused to show available units to fair housing testers posing as prospective tenants with children. Read HUD's charge.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to refuse to rent to a family because of children under the age of 18 and to make statements that discriminate against families with children. This includes publishing advertisements that indicate a preference or otherwise discriminate against families with children. Housing may exclude children only if it meets the Fair Housing Act's exemption for housing for older persons.
""Families have a difficult enough time finding suitable affordable housing without being turned down just because they have children,"" said Jeanine Worden, HUD's Acting Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue to take appropriate action when housing providers fail to meet their obligations under the Fair Housing Act.""
""Families with children have a right to the same housing opportunities as others,"" said Damon Smith, HUD's Principal Deputy General Counsel. ""HUD is committed to enforcing that right and ensuring that housing is available to families with children.""
The case came to HUD's attention when SouthCoast Fair Housing, a HUD Fair Housing Initiatives Program agency operating in Massachusetts and Rhode Island, filed a complaint based on fair housing tests it conducted after seeing an ad on Facebook for remodeled student apartments. The charge alleges that when testers contacted D&D Realty Management to inquire about available units and mentioned that they had children, the owner told them: ""Unfortunately, we can't allow children."" In addition, D&D Realty Management allegedly cancelled meetings to show units after learning that a tester had a child. Meanwhile, testing evidence showed that testers without children who applied for housing were shown available units and offered the opportunity to rent.
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party elects for the case to be heard in federal court. If the administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, the judge may award damages to the complainant for losses that have resulted from the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties in order to vindicate the public interest.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 877-8339 (Relay). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to hud.gov/fairhousing, or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple and Android devices."

HUD's charge specifically alleges that rental agents for Perry Homes told fair housing testers posing as prospective tenants with disabilities that they could accept service animals but were not permitted to accept ""emotional support"" animals. Read HUD's charge.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from discriminating against people with disabilities, including refusing to make reasonable accommodations in policies or practices when such accommodations may be necessary to provide persons with disabilities an equal opportunity to use or enjoy a dwelling. This includes permitting persons with disabilities to have service animals or assistance animals. Housing providers, unlike public accommodations, may not prohibit people with disabilities from having assistance animals that perform work or tasks, or that provide disability-related emotional support.
""Assistance animals provide an invaluable service to people who have disabilities, including disabilities affecting mental health,"" said Jeanine Worden, HUD's Acting Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Today's action demonstrates HUD's commitment to ensuring that housing providers follow the law by recognizing the right of persons with a disability-need for assistance animals to have that accommodation.""
""HUD will vigorously enforce the rights of persons with disabilities to receive the reasonable accommodations they need to enjoy their homes,"" said Damon Y. Smith, HUD's Principal Deputy General Counsel. ""HUD is committed to ensuring that housing providers do not discriminate against persons with disabilities who need assistance animals.""
The case came to HUD's attention when Southwestern Pennsylvania Legal Services (SPLS), a HUD Fair Housing Initiatives Program agency, filed a complaint after testers posing as prospective tenants who said they had assistance animals were told that the animals were not allowed. Specifically, according to HUD's charge, Perry Homes rental agents told testers that only registered service animals that had been trained for a specific duty would be permitted, and that Perry Homes was not obligated to accept ""emotional support"" animals.
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party elects for the case to be heard in federal court. If the administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, the judge may award damages to the complainant for losses that have resulted from the discrimination.

02/25/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-032.cfm,HUD Awards $1.5 Million to Help Families Improve their Economic Well-Being,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today awarded approximately $1.5 million to 13 public housing authorities (PHAs) to help residents of public housing and voucher-assisted housing increase their earned income and savings. See a list of grant funding by state below.
""Today's funding is a good example of how HUD works to help connect families to jobs and educational opportunities,"" said HUD Acting Secretary Matt Ammon. ""HUD is committed to helping assisted residents build skills and engage in careers. It is a core part of our mission.""
HUD's Family Self -Sufficiency (FSS) Program funding helps local public housing authorities to hire Service Coordinators who work directly with residents to connect them with existing programs and services in the local community. These Service Coordinators build relationships with networks of local service providers, who provide direct assistance to FSS participants. The broad spectrum of services made possible through FSS enables participating families to find jobs, increase earned income, and access opportunities to improve their long-term economic well-being.
Participants in the program sign a five-year contract of participation requiring the head of household to set specific goals and achievements allowed under the FSS Program. To successfully graduate, the head of household must be employed and no member of the FSS family may have received cash assistance for twelve months prior to program graduation. Families in the FSS program have an interest-bearing escrow account established for them. The amount credited to the family's escrow account is based on increases in rent due to improvement in the family's earned income during the term of the FSS contract. Upon successful graduation, the head of household receives the escrow funds and is able to apply those funds to advance their personal circumstances, including, for example, paying educational expenses or making a down-payment on a home.

EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take three months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, six months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2 percent) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percentage change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percentage changes are 90 percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percentage changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised 3 percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau's website (www.census.gov/construction/nrs/how_the_data_are_collected/index.html).
* The 90 percent confidence interval includes zero. In such cases, there is insufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero."

The Conciliation Agreement is between the Housing Equality Center of Pennsylvania; management companies HumanGood East, dba Presby's Inspired Life and HumanGood Pennsylvania, dba Presby's Inspired Life; twenty-seven apartment complex owners; and an individual with disabilities. Read the agreement.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from denying housing to persons with disabilities or subjecting them to discriminatory terms or conditions, including denying reasonable accommodation requests. In addition, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by recipients of federal financial assistance.
""For persons with disabilities, being granted a reasonable accommodation, such as a designated parking space, grab bars in a bathroom or an assistance animal, can mean the difference between merely having somewhere to live and being able to fully use and enjoy the place they call home,"" said Jeanine Worden, Acting Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Today's settlement sends a clear message that HUD is committed to ensuring that housing providers meet their responsibility to comply with the nation's housing laws.""

Read the agreement.
""The race of a homeowner and the racial composition of their neighborhood must not influence the valuation of a home,"" said Jeanine Worden, HUD's Acting Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""The Fair Housing Act prohibits the consideration of race as a factor in the appraisal of a home and in the provision of other real estate related services. Discrimination in home buying, mortgage lending, and property appraisal deprives qualified individuals of an equal opportunity to pursue homeownership as a path to family stability and financial security. HUD is committed to ensuring that all housing, whether for rent or for sale, is free from discrimination.""
Under the Conciliation Agreement, JPMorgan Chase Bank will pay $50,000 to the woman and provide home lending advisors and client care specialists with mandatory training on the Reconsideration of Value process and fair lending issues related to appraisals, including specifics regarding how to handle complaints of discrimination in the appraisal process.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to discriminate in the terms, conditions, or privileges of the sale of a dwelling because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, disability and familial status. The Act also makes it unlawful for any person or other entity whose business includes residential real estate-related transactions to discriminate against any person in making available such a transaction, or in the terms or conditions of such a transaction. Residential real estate-related transactions covered by the Act include making loans secured by residential real estate and appraising residential real property.

Secretary Fudge took the oath this evening after the Senate voted to confirm her. As Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Fudge now leads a federal department with wide reach throughout the United States, including the Offices of Housing, Community Planning and Development, Federal Housing Administration, Public and Indian Housing, Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, Policy Development and Research, Field Policy and Management, Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae), Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes, and Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships.
Below find video remarks delivered by Secretary Fudge.
You may watch the remarks here (www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CD2HZcI7W4).
Video remarks as delivered:
A good home shapes nearly every part of our lives. It's where we start and end each day. It's where we raise our families and come together in times of joy. It's where we find shelter and comfort during times of hardship.
The past year has reminded us just how important it is to have a safe and stable place to call home. But, right now-for millions of Americans-that sense of security and peace of mind is out of reach.
Our country has an immense responsibility-and profound opportunity-to address the housing crisis facing so many people.
To provide relief for those struggling to pay their rent or mortgage as a result of the pandemic.
To ensure every American experiencing homelessness has a roof over their head.
To revitalize our communities-and help more Americans achieve their dream of homeownership.
To break down the barriers of injustice that still limit the futures of far too many young people.
Every community faces unique challenges that require its own unique solutions.
We all want and deserve the same basic things: a safe place to live and an opportunity to succeed with dignity, with grace, and with hope.
I'm Marcia Fudge-and I'm honored to serve as the 18th Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.
I am proud to join a group of public servants who work with compassion and determination to change the lives of those in need. And I can't wait to get started."
03/12/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-039.cfm,HUD Secretary Fudge Issues Video Message to HUD Staff,"WASHINGTON - Today, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Marcia L. Fudge sent the following message to the Department:
You may watch remarks here (www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENP8fqRvGII).
Hi everyone. Earlier this week I was sworn in as the 18th Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. It is my honor and a privilege to join this team, and I look forward to working with all of you in the days, months, and years ahead.
For the past 13 years, I served as a Member of Congress, representing the people of Ohio's 11th District. Before that, as mayor of Warrensville Heights, Ohio, I saw firsthand the need for economic development and affordable housing.
Throughout my life of public service, my purpose has always been to do the most for those who have the least. These are values I will bring to HUD as we carry out our most fundamental mission - working to ensure that every American has a roof over their head.
Today, in this moment of unprecedented crisis, our mission carries added urgency and purpose. The pandemic has exacerbated our nation's already severe housing crisis. Tens of millions of Americans are behind on rent; almost 3 million homeowners are currently in forbearance; and another 800,000 borrowers are delinquent. Far too many of our fellow Americans are struggling to make ends meet or simply not making ends meet at all.
Since the beginning of this pandemic, HUD employees have been instrumental in delivering on the housing needs of the American people. Just recently, HUD announced extensions and expansions of COVID-19 homeowner relief and home retention measures, providing meaningful relief to homeowners struggling financially through no fault of their own. Yet much work remains.
We must alleviate this housing crisis and get people the support they need to come back from the edge.
The work ahead will test us, but I know we are up to the task.
As we confront the pandemic, we will continue the everyday routine business of the Department - everything from providing housing counseling and investigating allegations of housing discrimination, to restoring an evidence-based Housing First approach, to ending homelessness and supporting sustainable economic development in our communities. These responsibilities are at the very center of HUD's work, and we must always ensure they are met.
Of course, there are longer-term priorities as well.
We must expand resources for HUD's programs to people who are eligible.
We must deliver on the Administration's commitments on improving the quality, safety, and accessibility of affordable housing and building 1.5 million new affordable homes. This also means that we must deliver relief to struggling small landlords, who are a vital source of affordable housing in many of our cities.
And we must make the dream of homeownership - and the security and wealth creation that comes with it - a reality for more Americans by ending discriminatory practices in the housing market and ensuring that our fair housing rules are doing what they are supposed to do.
In addition, HUD will play a key role in tackling the “convergent crises” identified by President Biden: the crisis of systemic racism and racial inequity, the climate crisis, and the economic crisis, in addition to COVID-19.
After all, the role of housing is not only about having a place to live. It's also about expanding access to opportunity; building strong, sustainable, equitable, and healthy communities; and improving outcomes for all people, regardless of race, station, or background.
The challenges before us are not beyond our capacity to solve. But it will take a diverse, equitable, and inclusive Department at all levels - a Department that values knowledge and expertise, both lived and professional; transparent communication and accountability; and thoughtful, collaborative leadership. That's the Department I intend to lead, and always by example. I am eager to hear your thoughts on how we can improve the Department, restore sound management, and rebuild trust. Your ideas and suggestions will always be carefully considered as we drive forward our vital work to increase equitable access to housing for millions of families.
That is why, as soon as is safely possible, I plan to travel to each of our 10 regions.
It's also why I have asked our team to put together group meetings for me to speak with HUD staff in the coming days. While I won't be able to meet with everyone right away, rest assured that these meetings will continue in the weeks and months ahead.
I promise you this: the health and safety of HUD's employees and contractors will always be of paramount importance. HUD's response to the COVID-19 pandemic - both internally and externally - will continue to be driven by data and science, and we will continue to require the correct and consistent wearing of masks and physical distancing within all HUD buildings. There will also be more communication - not just on COVID-19, but on all matters that impact this department.
The Housing Act of 1949 declared that every American deserves a “decent home and a suitable living environment.” Our nation has fallen short of this declaration and, in fact, has a history of imposing barriers to safe, accessible, and affordable housing.
Together we will remove barriers and take meaningful action to solve the housing challenges of all Americans in need. I believe each of you is doing the work you have been called to do. If not, you are in the wrong agency.
Thank you for your service. I look forward to meeting you and to working alongside you as we move forward, together, with resolve, to tackle the tasks of our time and build back better on behalf of the American people.
Always know I am on your side."
03/16/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-040.cfm,HUD Charges Pennsylvania Landlords with Sexual Harassment and Retaliation,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is charging the husband-and-wife owners of apartments in Oil City, Pennsylvania, with sexual harassment and retaliation against a female resident. HUD's charge alleges that the husband groped and tried to forcibly kiss the woman when he was in her unit to perform electrical repairs. HUD's charge further alleges that the owners retaliated against the woman and her infant child after she told the wife about the husband's harassment. Read HUD's charge.
""Home is the place where we all should feel safe. Unfortunately, too many women are not safe in their own homes because their housing providers or maintenance personnel subject them to unwelcome sexual advances,"" said Jeanine Worden, HUD's Acting Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""This is particularly true for women who reside in low-income households. Today's action demonstrates HUD's strong and continuing commitment to use the Fair Housing Act to combat sexual harassment in housing.""
The Fair Housing Act prohibits harassment of tenants and other forms of housing discrimination because of race, sex, color, national origin, disability, religion and familial status.
This case came to HUD's attention when the woman filed a complaint. The charge alleges that the husband co-owner of the apartments made sexual advances toward the female tenant when he was in her unit to perform repairs. The charge also alleges that when the female tenant told the wife about the harassment, the wife texted her: ""You are out,"" ""You got 10 days,"" and ""You are a liar."" The female tenant and her child were subsequently evicted and charged for unpaid rent and legal fees. The housing at issue was rented using a Housing Choice Voucher.
""Women should be free from sexual harassment in their own homes,"" said Damon Y. Smith, HUD's Principal Deputy General Counsel. ""HUD will vigorously enforce women's right to enjoy their homes free from harassment or intimidation, including unwanted sexual advances.""
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party elects for the case to be heard in federal court. If the administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, the judge may award damages to the complainant for losses that have resulted from the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties in order to vindicate the public interest.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 877-8339 (Relay). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to hud.gov/fairhousing."
03/18/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-041.cfm,HUD Releases 2020 Annual Homeless Assessment Report Part 1,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today released its 2020 Annual Homeless Assessment Report Part 1 to Congress (www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/ahar/2020-ahar-part-1-pit-estimates-of-homelessness-in-the-us.html). The report found that 580,466 people experienced homelessness in the United States on a single night in 2020, an increase of 12,751 people, or 2.2 percent, from 2019.
The report found that between 2019 and 2020, homelessness increased significantly among unsheltered populations and people experiencing chronic homelessness. Veteran homelessness did not decrease compared with 2019, and homelessness among family households did not decrease for the first time since 2010. The report also found that people of color are significantly over-represented among people experiencing homelessness.
""The findings of the 2020 AHAR Part 1 Report are very troubling, even before you consider what COVID-19 has done to make the homelessness crisis worse,"" said Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Marcia L. Fudge. ""Thanks to President Biden's leadership, we are once again putting Housing First to end this crisis and build strong, healthy communities, as reflected in the American Rescue Plan. I look forward to working with President Biden to implement this historic package to deliver robust, equitable relief to those experiencing homelessness. Housing should be a right, not a privilege, and ensuring that every American has a safe, stable home is a national imperative.""
""Even a slight pre-pandemic uptick in Veteran homelessness after significant declines since 2010 is extremely concerning,"" said Secretary of Veterans Affairs Denis McDonough. ""The Biden Administration's recommitment to Housing First - a proven strategy and dignified way to help Veterans and others achieve stable, permanent housing - will help accelerate progress in preventing and eliminating Veteran homelessness. The American Rescue Plan will also make a major impact in improving outcomes for Veterans by expanding access to community-based homeless prevention and rapid rehousing services for those who may not qualify for VA care.""
HUD releases the Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress (AHAR) in two parts. Part 1 provides Point-in-Time (PIT) estimates, offering a snapshot of homelessness-both sheltered and unsheltered-on a single night. The one-night counts are conducted during the last 10 days of January each year. The PIT counts also provide an estimate of the number of people experiencing homelessness within particular homeless populations such as individuals with chronic patterns of homelessness and veterans experiencing homelessness.
In 2020, the PIT estimates of people experiencing homelessness in sheltered and unsheltered locations, as well as the number of beds available to serve them, were reported by 396 Continuums of Care (CoC) nationwide. These 396 CoCs covered virtually the entire United States.
The Point-in-Time counts of homelessness and the housing inventory information are based on data from January 2020 and thus do not reflect the health or economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic for levels of homelessness or characteristic of people experiencing homelessness.
Key Findings of HUD's 2020 Annual Homeless Assessment Report Part 1:
On a single night in January 2020, 580,466 people - about 18 of every 10,000 people in the United States - experienced homelessness across the United States. This represents 2.2 percent increase from 2019. After steady reductions from 2010 to 2016, homelessness has increased in the last four consecutive years. The increase in homelessness was due to the rise in unsheltered individuals (a 7 percent increase from 2019) and this increase impacted the large increase in individuals experiencing chronic homelessness (a 15 percent increase since 2019). The increase in unsheltered homelessness is driven largely by increases in California and coincide with increases in overall homelessness. Veteran homelessness did not decline in 2020. 2020 was the first year that homelessness among family households did not fall since 2010. Youth homelessness is slightly down (a 2.2 percent decrease from 2019). People of color are significantly over-represented among people experiencing homelessness.
• On a single night in January 2020, 580,466 people - about 18 of every 10,000 people in the United States - experienced homelessness across the United States. This represents 2.2 percent increase from 2019.
• After steady reductions from 2010 to 2016, homelessness has increased in the last four consecutive years.
• The increase in homelessness was due to the rise in unsheltered individuals (a 7 percent increase from 2019) and this increase impacted the large increase in individuals experiencing chronic homelessness (a 15 percent increase since 2019). The increase in unsheltered homelessness is driven largely by increases in California and coincide with increases in overall homelessness.
• Veteran homelessness did not decline in 2020. 2020 was the first year that homelessness among family households did not fall since 2010.
• Youth homelessness is slightly down (a 2.2 percent decrease from 2019).
• People of color are significantly over-represented among people experiencing homelessness.
Homelessness Among All People
The total number of people experiencing homelessness on a single night in January 2020 is 580,466, an increase of 2.2 percent from January 2019 driven by increases in the unsheltered homeless population. The number of people experiencing homelessness nationwide increased by two percent between 2019 and 2020, or 12,751 more people. This marks the fourth consecutive year that total homelessness has increased in the United States.
Chronic Homelessness
On a single night in January 2020, there were 110,528 individuals experiencing chronic homelessness, just over one-quarter of all homeless individuals. This is the first time since 2011 that the number of people with chronic patterns of homelessness exceeded 100,000. The number of people experiencing chronic homelessness increased 15 percent from 2019.
Unsheltered Homelessness
On a single night in 2020, nearly four in ten (39 percent or 226,080 people) were in unsheltered locations such as on the street, in abandoned buildings, or in other places not suitable for human habitation. Between 2019 and 2020, the number of people counted in unsheltered locations rose by 7 percent or 14,787 people. 2020 marks the first time since data collection began that more individuals experiencing homelessness were unsheltered than were sheltered. Between 2019 and 2020, the number of unsheltered individuals increased by seven percent while the number of sheltered individuals remained largely unchanged. Increases in the unsheltered population occurred across all geographic categories.
Family Homelessness
There were 171,575 people in families with children who experienced homelessness on a single night in 2020, essentially the same as in 2019. Nine in ten people experiencing homelessness in families with children were sheltered, 154,908 people. Ten percent of people in families with children, 16,667 people, were found in unsheltered locations.
Veteran Homelessness
On a single night in January 2020, 37,252 veterans were experiencing homelessness in the U.S., eight percent of all homeless adults. Between 2019 and 2020, the number of veterans experiencing homelessness increased by less than one percent (167 more people). The increase was entirely among veterans staying in unsheltered places (859 more veterans). However, in 2020 36,115 fewer veterans were experiencing homelessness than in 2009, when these data were first reported, a drop of nearly 50 percent.
Homelessness Among People of Color
African Americans and indigenous people (including Native Americans and Pacific Islanders) remained considerably overrepresented among the homeless population compared to the U.S. population. Almost 4 of every 10 people experiencing homelessness in January 2020 were Black or African American (39% or 228,796 people). A higher percentage of people in shelter were Black or African American (47% or 167,205 people) than were people experiencing homelessness in unsheltered locations (27% or 61,591). Almost a quarter of all people experiencing homelessness, 23 percent, were Hispanic or Latino (counting people of all races who identify as Hispanic or Latino). Together, American Indian, Alaska Native, Pacific Islander and Native Hawaiian populations account for one percent of the U.S. population, but five percent of the homeless population and seven percent of the unsheltered population."

Fudge today delivered the following remarks at the White House press briefing on the American Rescue Plan and housing:
Jen, thanks for inviting me to speak about the importance of the American Rescue Plan as it relates to the urgent housing needs facing our nation today.
What a way to complete my very first week as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.
At HUD, we know firsthand the severe impact of COVID-19 on our nation's housing crisis.
HUD staff in every region of the country have worked tirelessly to assist grantees and recipients of HUD assistance in their response to the pandemic.
We've helped housing owners, housing authorities, and communities provide additional rental assistance and support new efforts to eradicate homelessness.
We've extended the Federal Housing Administration's foreclosure and eviction moratoriums until June 30th to support the immediate and ongoing needs of homeowners.
Under the Biden-Harris Administration, HUD is making greater efforts to keep Americans safe from COVID-19.
We're strengthening partnerships between recipients of HUD assistance and public health agencies and health care providers.
Many of the people living in federally-assisted housing have risk factors that make them particularly vulnerable to COVID.
These factors include disability, race, and low-income, along with racial and ethnic disparities in access to response, care, and treatment.
We're making sure that federal, state, and local efforts to reach those most at-risk of COVID are linking those efforts to people living in housing HUD supports.
The American Rescue Plan is critical to our success in these efforts.
Some of you may know that my last vote as a Member of Congress was for the American Rescue Plan.
I was proud to vote for this historic legislation to get help to the American people during this moment of great challenge.
I thank President Biden for the leadership that has gotten us to this point.
The American people can be confident that help is here.
The President has described the American Rescue Plan as ""shots in arms and money in pockets.""
I would add, as it relates to housing, the American Rescue Plan keeps people housed and brings people home."

The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to make housing unavailable or to discriminate in the terms, conditions, or privileges of the sale of a dwelling because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, disability and familial status. The Act also makes it unlawful for any person or entity whose business includes residential real estate-related transactions to discriminate against any person in making available such a transaction, or in the terms or conditions of such a transaction. Residential real estate-related transactions covered by the Act include mortgage loans.
Under the Conciliation Agreement, Wells Fargo Bank will pay $125,000 to the woman and provide fair housing training for its employees, including home mortgage consultants, managers and underwriters. It will also ensure that its policies do not violate the Fair Housing Act.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 877-8339 (Relay). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to hud.gov/fair housing."

EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take three months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, six months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2 percent) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percentage change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percentage changes are 90 percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percentage changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised 3 percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau's website (www.census.gov/construction/nrs/how_the_data_are_collected/index.html)."
03/24/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-045.cfm,HUD Approves Agreement with California Housing Provider Resolving Claims of Disability Discrimination,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has approved a Conciliation Agreement between Monterey, California-based rental property owners and managers G Davi Properties and Guido A. Davi II and a resident of one of their properties, resolving claims that the providers denied the resident's reasonable accommodation request to keep an assistance animal. Read the agreement.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from discriminating against people with disabilities, including refusing to make reasonable accommodations in policies or practices when such accommodations may be necessary to provide persons with disabilities an equal opportunity to use or enjoy a dwelling. This includes permitting persons with disabilities to have service animals or assistance animals. Housing providers, unlike public accommodations, may not prohibit people with disabilities from having assistance animals that perform work or tasks, or that provide disability-related emotional support.
""An assistance animal can be a lifeline for persons with disabilities,"" said Jeanine Worden, HUD's Acting Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD is committed to enforcing the Fair Housing Act to ensure that housing providers recognize their obligation to make such right to that accommodations and comply with the nation's fair housing laws.""
The complaint came to HUD's attention when the resident with disabilities filed a complaint alleging that G Davi Properties and Guido A. Davi II discriminated against him by failing to grant his request to keep an assistance animal. After denying his request, the owners allegedly cancelled the lease, changed the locks on the unit, and threatened to call the police in the event that he attempted to move in. The owners also allegedly claimed that the man never disclosed his need for an assistance animal, even though he provided a letter from his physician verifying his disability and need for the assistance animal.
The owners/managers deny that they discriminated against the complainant and denied any violation of law, but voluntarily agreed to settle the complaint. Under the Conciliation Agreement, they will pay $10,000 to the resident, provide fair housing training for their employees, create and implement a written Reasonable Accommodation Policy, and modify any rental forms or materials to be consistent with the Fair Housing Act.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 877-8339 (Relay). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to hud.gov/fairhousing. For more information about assistance animals under the Fair Housing Act, please see here."

Fudge on Thursday announced $450 million in Indian Housing Block Grants (IHBG) to Indian tribes across the country to respond to COVID-19. This funding will be used to help Tribes carry out affordable housing activities to protect the safety and health of their Tribal members and communities.
The list of tribes can be found here.
On Thursday, the Biden-Harris administration's ""Help is Here"" tour will focus on showing how the American Rescue Plan provides the much-needed relief to state, local, territorial, and Tribal governments and lift up their communities from the pandemic and economic recession.
""With the enactment of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, President Biden is making a clear statement that the Federal Government is committed to ensuring equitable access to communities hardest hit by the pandemic,"" said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""HUD understands the significance of our responsibility to serve American Indian and Alaska Native families, and the Department is dedicated to working in a government-to-government manner with Tribes to quickly bring much-needed relief to Tribal communities.""
Indian Housing Block Grants primarily benefit low-income American Indian and Alaska Native families. The amount of each grant is based on a formula that considers local needs and housing units managed. Eligible activities for the funds include housing development, operation and maintenance, modernization of existing housing, housing services to eligible families and individuals, housing management services, crime prevention and safety activities, and model activities that provide creative approaches to solving affordable housing problems in Indian Country."

Fudge today announced $5 million in Native Hawaiian Housing Block Grant (NHHBG) funding under the American Rescue Plan to support the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands (DHHL) in its response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Through this much-needed relief funding, DHHL will be better prepared to address the housing needs of low-income Native Hawaiian families impacted by COVID-19.
""The American Rescue Plan made a historic investment toward the housing needs of low-income communities,"" said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""HUD is supporting the swift implementation of the funding allocations to get relief to communities. With this funding, DHHL will be able to respond to the unique needs of the Native Hawaiian community.""
Under the American Rescue Plan, NHHBG funding may be used to support new construction, rehabilitation, acquisition, infrastructure, and various support services. Additionally, these program funds may also be used to provide critical rental assistance to Native Hawaiians residing on or off Hawaiian Home Lands.
""With funding from the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, HUD is working expeditiously to help the Native Hawaiian community respond to COVID-19,"" said Deputy Assistant Secretary Heidi Frechette.

03/26/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-048.cfm,HUD Report on Youth Homelessness Underscores Importance of American Rescue Plan,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today released a report on coordinated community approaches to preventing and ending youth homelessness. The report, ""Evaluation of the HUD Youth Homelessness Demonstration Program: Early Implementation Report (www.huduser.gov/portal/publications/EvalYHDP-InterimRpt.html),"" underscores the importance of the American Rescue Plan to addressing homelessness, including for youth.
The report found that funding awarded by HUD to 10 Continuums of Care (CoCs) - state and local planning agencies that coordinate their area's response to homelessness - enabled communities across the country to increase access to housing for youth experiencing homelessness through a variety of approaches, more directly integrating youth into systems with resources like rapid re-housing and programs using evidence-based models like Housing First.
""This report shows that when communities have dedicated funds, they are able to more effectively and aggressively expand efforts to deliver relief to youth and young adults experiencing homelessness,"" said Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Marcia L. Fudge. ""Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, communities will have access to billions in additional funds to further scale up initiatives to prevent and end homelessness, including for youth, and to put Housing First.""
Access to permanent housing through tools like rapid re-housing is the cornerstone of the evidence-based Housing First approach to ending homelessness - an approach reflected in the recently-enacted American Rescue Plan. The ARP, signed into law on March 11 by President Biden, provides $5 billion for the HOME Investment Partnerships Program to help create housing and services for people experiencing or at risk of homelessness in communities across the country. The American Rescue Plan will also allow the communities highlighted in the Early Implementation Report to more fully implement their plans for a sustainable infrastructure for serving youth experiencing homelessness.
The $5 billion in HOME funding is the first of two homelessness-related funding opportunities from the American Rescue Plan that HUD will release. In the coming weeks, HUD will announce the allocation of funding for emergency vouchers for people experiencing and at-risk of homelessness.
In 2016, HUD awarded funds to 10 Continuums of Care (CoCs) in round one of the Youth Homelessness Demonstration Program (YHDP) (www.hudexchange.info/programs/yhdp) to enable them to develop and implement coordinated community approaches to preventing and ending youth homelessness. The Early Implementation Report serves as an important baseline from which to evaluate changes and outcomes of the program when it concludes for these initial 10 participant CoCs. A final report is expected in fall 2021.
In the coming months, HUD will issue a Notice of Funding Opportunity that will make available $145 million to select up to 50 communities to participate in additional rounds of the Youth Homelessness Demonstration Program to develop and execute a coordinated community approach to preventing and ending youth homelessness. Eight of the 50 selected communities must be rural communities.
The release of the Early Implementation Report comes on the heels of HUD's 2020 Annual Homeless Assessment Report Part 1 to Congress (www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/ahar/2020-ahar-part-1-pit-estimates-of-homelessness-in-the-us.html). AHAR Part 1 found that homelessness was increasing even prior to COVID-19. The report also found that youth homelessness is slightly down (a 2.2 percent decrease) from 2019."
03/30/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-049.cfm,Secretary Fudge Statement on the State of the FHA Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund,"WASHINGTON - Secretary Marcia L. Fudge on Tuesday released the following statement on the quarterly report to Congress on FHA Single-Family Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund Programs:
HUD has an obligation to provide a quarterly report to Congress on the FHA insurance program and provide detailed information on the composition, credit quality, and financial position of the program. I am taking this opportunity to discuss the state of the FHA insurance program and the health of the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund a year after the COVID-19 health and economic fallout.
The health of FHA's Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund has remained resilient despite the financial challenges faced by homeowners with FHA-insured mortgages in 2020. The fund stands at more than $80 billion and remains well above the 2% minimum capital reserve required. Through the pandemic, the FHA portfolio has experienced increased levels of seriously delinquent loans and a heightened level of loans in forbearance. We continue to monitor mortgage performance trends within our portfolio, particularly related to those homeowners who are struggling financially because of the pandemic.
Tens of millions of families have been devastated by this pandemic, and housing has been a critical part of how we keep people safe. The FHA insurance program provides crucial access to credit and homeownership for first-time homebuyers, low-to-moderate income families, and households of color who have been historically underserved. We are committed to an equitable recovery and recognize the unprecedented moment and opportunity for HUD to lead the way.
In order to provide assistance to those struggling as a result of the pandemic, FHA took proactive policy steps in February to assist homeowners by extending foreclosure and eviction moratoria through June 30, streamlining COVID-19 loss mitigation options, and allowing longer forbearance for borrowers whose plans were expiring. We are already starting to see the positive effects of the President's immediate actions (www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/02/16/fact-sheet-biden-administration-announces-extension-of-covid-19-forbearance-and-foreclosure-protections-for-homeowners/) during the first weeks of his Administration to help the nation's homeowners, but we have much more work to do.
The American Rescue Plan recently signed into law by President Biden includes crucial and unprecedented resources for housing, including nearly $10 Billion Homeowner Assistance Fund, to help homeowners behind on their mortgage and utility payments and avoid foreclosure and eviction. The actions we are taking now will help position the FHA program to continue to fulfill its critical mission in the future.
Given the current FHA delinquency crisis and our duty to manage risks and the overall health of the fund, we have no near-term plans to change FHA's mortgage insurance premium pricing. We will continue to rigorously evaluate our strategy and work transparently with Congress. Our number one priority is helping families keep their homes and remain safe as we work toward an equitable recovery."

WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today kicked off Fair Housing Month 2021. This year's Fair Housing Month theme, Fair Housing: More Than Just Words, reflects the Biden-Harris Administration's commitment to advancing equity in housing and the importance of increasing public awareness of everyone's right to fair housing.
""Fair Housing Month is a time to recommit to our nation's obligation to ensure that everyone has equal access to safe, affordable housing,"" said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""Unfortunately, housing discrimination still exists, from individuals and families being denied a place to call home because of the color of their skin or where they come from, to landlords refusing to allow persons with disabilities to keep assistance animals, to individuals being denied a place to live because of who they love. In this moment of unprecedented crisis, fair housing is more important than ever. 53 years after the Fair Housing Act was signed, our journey to justice in housing continues.""
Each April, HUD, local communities, fair housing advocates, and fair housing organizations across the country commemorate Fair Housing Month by hosting an array of activities that highlight HUD's fair housing enforcement efforts, enhance Americans' awareness of their fair housing rights, and emphasize the importance of ending housing discrimination.
Secretary Fudge will commemorate Fair Housing Month with a virtual celebration on April 7th at 2 p.m. Eastern time that will also feature the Justice Department's Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Pamela Karlan; HUD's Acting Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, Jeanine Worden; and HUD Senior Advisor Alanna McCargo.
In addition to highlighting HUD's enforcement activities, a central focus of this year's commemoration will the Biden-Harris Administration's pledge to end housing discrimination, provide redress to those who have experienced housing discrimination, to eliminate racial bias and other forms of discrimination in all stages of home-buying and renting, and to secure equal access to housing opportunity for all.
Last year, HUD and its Fair Housing Assistance Program partner agencies received more than 7,700 complaints alleging discrimination based on one or more of the Fair Housing Act's seven protected classes: race, color, national origin, religion, sex, family status, and disability. During that period, the categories with the highest number of complaints were disability and race, respectively. HUD also received complaints that alleged lending discrimination as well as numerous complaints from women who faced unfair treatment, including sexual harassment.
""Although the Fair Housing Act became law in 1968, we still have major challenges ahead of us,"" said Jeanine Worden, HUD's Acting Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""This April, on the 53rd anniversary of the Fair Housing Act, HUD is renewing its commitment to level the playing field so every person has the same opportunity to live where they choose and benefit from all of the opportunities this nation offers.""

""We are excited to announce this historic funding allocation, which will enable states to expand and preserve affordable housing for our neighbors who need our support the most.""
The Housing Trust Fund is capitalized through the contributions made by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. This year's allocation is a significant increase in funding from last year's allocation of $322,564,267.66. This program is specifically focused on housing for some of our most vulnerable populations. HUD annually allocates HTF funds by formula. A state must use at least 80 percent of each annual grant for rental housing; up to 10 percent for homeownership; and up to 10 percent for the grantee's reasonable administrative and planning costs. HTF funds may be used for the production or preservation of affordable housing through the acquisition, new construction, reconstruction, and/or rehabilitation of non-luxury housing with suitable amenities. All HTF-assisted units will be required to have a minimum affordability period of 30 years. The Housing Trust Fund has supported the construction or rehabilitation of 775 rental units nationally since the first were allocated in 2017. There are currently 480 additional projects under construction. This year's funding is expected to produce more than 5,400 additional affordable units."

""Addressing our nation's urgent housing challenges and building a more affordable, equitable, and resilient housing system demands strong federal leadership backed by robust federal funding,"" said Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""President Biden's FY22 discretionary funding request turns the page on years of inadequate and harmful spending requests and instead empowers HUD to meet the housing needs of families and communities across the country. I am particularly pleased that the request proposes more than $30 billion to expand housing vouchers to an additional 200,000 low-income families. I look forward to working with the President to advance HUD's critical priorities.""
The President's FY22 discretionary request provides a total of $68.7 billion for HUD, an increase of $9 billion over the 2021 enacted level. The request:
Expands Housing Choice Vouchers to 200,000 Additional Families. The Housing Choice Voucher program currently provides 2.3 million low-income families with rental assistance to obtain housing in the private market. The discretionary funding request proposes $30.4 billion, a substantial increase of $5.4 billion over the 2021 enacted level, to maintain services for all currently assisted families and expand assistance to an additional 200,000 households, particularly for those who are homeless or fleeing domestic violence. This funding also includes mobility-related supportive services to provide low-income families who live in racially and ethnically concentrated areas of poverty with greater options to move to higher-opportunity neighborhoods. Makes Significant Investments to End Homelessness. To prevent and reduce homelessness, the 2022 discretionary funding request provides $3.5 billion, an increase of $500 million over 2021 enacted levels, for Homeless Assistance Grants to support more than 100,000 additional households, including survivors of domestic violence and homeless youth. These resources would complement the $5 billion for emergency housing vouchers provided in the American Rescue Plan, which will also assist those who are homeless and at-risk of homelessness. Modernizes and Improves Energy Efficiency, Resilience, and Safety in HUD-Assisted Housing. HUD-supported rental properties collectively provide 2.3 million affordable homes to low-income families. The funding request not only fully funds the operating costs across this portfolio, but also provides $800 million in new investments across HUD programs for modernization and rehabilitation aimed at energy efficiency and resilience to climate change impacts like increasingly frequent and severe wildfires and floods. These retrofits would help lower the costs and improve the quality of public and HUD-assisted housing while creating good-paying jobs. In addition, the discretionary request includes $3.2 billion for Public Housing modernization grants, an increase of $435 million above the 2021 enacted level. Increases the Supply of Affordable Housing. To address the critical shortage of affordable housing in communities throughout the Nation, the funding request provides a $500 million increase to the HOME Investment Partnerships Program, for a total of $1.9 billion, to construct and rehabilitate affordable rental housing, and to support other housing-related needs. This is the highest funding level for HOME since 2009. In addition, the proposal provides $180 million to support 2,000 units of new permanently affordable housing for the elderly and persons with disabilities, supporting the Administration's priority to maximize independent living for people with disabilities.

These discretionary investments reflect only one element of the President's broader agenda. In the coming months, the Administration will release the President's Budget, which will present a unified, comprehensive plan to address the overlapping crises we face in a fiscally and economically responsible way.

04/12/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-058.cfm,HUD Awards More Than $90 Million for Affordable Housing in Tribal Communities,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today announced over $90 million in grant awards to 24 Tribes and Tribally Designated Housing Entities (TDHEs) across the country to support new housing construction, housing rehabilitation, and critical infrastructure projects.
""This past year was a stark reminder of just how important access to safe, stable housing is—especially in Tribal communities disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic,"" said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""The funding HUD is awarding today will support much needed affordable housing investments in Indian Country.""
The funds were awarded through HUD's Indian Housing Block Grant (IHBG) Competitive program to help construct new housing units for low-income families living in Tribal communities. It is projected that this funding will support the construction of approximately 350 new housing units, which will help spur economic opportunities in these communities. This year's IHBG competition generated a lot of interest and was very oversubscribed with a total of 141 applicants submitted by Tribes and TDHEs. This is the second time HUD is making awards under this program; the first round of awards was made in December 2019.
The funding allocation is below.
FY 2020 COMPETITIVE INDIAN HOUSING BLOCK GRANT (IHBG) AWARDS"
04/12/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-059.cfm,"Secretaries of HUD, VA joint statement on ending Veteran homelessness","WASHINGTON - The Department of Housing and Urban Development's 2020 Annual Homeless Assessment Report (AHAR) to Congress (www.huduser.gov/portal/sites/default/files/pdf/2020-AHAR-Part-1.pdf) found that on a single night in January 2020, there were 37,252 Veterans experiencing homelessness in America, an increase of 0.4% over 2019.
This number does not account for the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has added to the nation's housing challenges, including among Veterans.
AHAR showed investments from Congress along with strong collaboration between the Departments of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Housing and Urban Development (HUD) brought about a 47% reduction in Veteran homelessness between 2010 and 2016. However, a GAO report (www.gao.gov/products/gao-20-428) found that, since 2016, progress towards ending Veteran homelessness has stalled. We find this pattern deeply concerning. No Veteran who has served this country - let alone more than 37,000 on a given night - should experience homelessness.
We, the secretaries of VA and HUD, are aligning efforts and joining forces to work towards ending Veteran homelessness. We are mobilizing the strength of our two departments to do everything in our power to ensure every Veteran has access to safe and stable housing.
We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to tackle this crisis. The American Rescue Plan (www.whitehouse.gov/American-Rescue-Plan/) included more than $10 billion in funding for individuals who are experiencing or at risk of experiencing homelessness. The American Jobs Plan (www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/31/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan/) would invest $213 billion to produce, preserve, and retrofit more than two million affordable homes.
Our collaboration is the first step of a multi-phased whole-of-government effort that will ultimately help us end Veteran homelessness. We will evaluate existing strategies, implement new approaches when necessary, and execute a plan to ensure we achieve tangible results that incorporate best practices, feedback, and lessons learned from Veterans, advocacy groups, and other stakeholders.
To fulfill this mission, we will:
Make ending Veteran homelessness a top priority - VA and HUD will prioritize this effort at the highest levels. Staff in both agencies will collaboratively develop a strategy to significantly reduce the number of Veterans experiencing homelessness, as well as a strategy to ensure that no Veteran experiences homelessness in the future. The secretaries will participate in listening sessions with stakeholder groups, including Veterans with lived expertise. Information and materials gathered will be analyzed for use during quarterly meetings with homeless program staff from both departments to inform decisions about changes to policies and programs. We will develop targets, assess progress, and hold our agencies accountable. Lead with an evidence-based Housing First approach - Evidence and past progress on reducing Veteran homelessness demonstrate a Housing First approach works. Together, our agencies will ensure targeted interventions (such as HUD-VA Supportive Housing (www.va.gov/homeless/hud-vash.asp), Supportive Services for Veteran Families (www.va.gov/homeless/ssvf/), and Grant and Per Diem (www.va.gov/homeless/gpd.asp)) help Veterans obtain stable housing as quickly as possible without barriers or preconditions. Reach underserved Veterans - Reducing Veteran homelessness will require new approaches to serving Veterans for whom prior efforts may have fallen short. These include Veterans with less than honorable discharge status, as well as Veterans who are women, members of racial and ethnic minority groups, transgender and gender non-conforming, aging, and/or living in rural areas. We will ensure our interagency effort identifies and removes barriers to VA care and services, so benefits are equitably available among underserved Veteran communities. Ensure the delivery of quality supportive services - Supportive services are critical to helping Veterans find and retain housing, and to use it as a platform for achieving health, recovery, and economic success. Working diligently with federal and community stakeholders, we commit to identifying ways to ensure Veterans have access to quality supportive health, mental health, and legal services (www.va.gov/healthpartnerships/updates/mlp/mlpadditionalresources.asp) alongside employment (www.va.gov/HOMELESS/HVCES.asp) and housing assistance, whether provided by VA or community partners. Increase the supply of and access to affordable housing - A significant obstacle to ending Veteran homelessness is the lack of affordable housing, especially in many urban centers. We will work jointly, including examining opportunities through the American Rescue Plan and the American Jobs Plan, to increase the supply of affordable housing and ensure Veterans have access. Our agencies will do this by engaging landlords, and affordable housing developers, supporting the use of federal programs to create and subsidize affordable housing, identifying ways to improve Veteran access to these housing units, and supporting state and local collaboration to finance and create affordable housing.

Working to end Veteran homelessness requires a multi-agency effort, coordinated through the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness. Together, we can enhance how we deliver services and provide opportunities to Veterans to ensure we bring the full force of the federal government to end Veteran homelessness."
04/12/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-060.cfm,"HUD Initiates Order to Halt Funding to Brooklyn, New York, Operator of Affordable Housing Developments Due to Violations of Anti-Discrimination Laws","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it will begin procedures to suspend federal affordable housing funds to Carbrook Associates, LP (Carbrook), after a HUD investigation revealed that it violated federal anti-discrimination laws in the operation of 81 units of multifamily housing in Brooklyn, New York. Read HUD's letter.
HUD's investigation found that Carbrook failed to address widespread architectural barriers that limit access by individuals with disabilities. In 2019, HUD notified Carbrook of its findings of violations of federal law involving discrimination against individuals with disabilities. Carbrook has refused to come into voluntary compliance to resolve the findings of discrimination.
HUD also commenced a concurrent investigation based on concerns that Carbrook may be excluding tenants of racial and other minority groups in violation of federal anti-discrimination law, leaving the properties occupied almost exclusively by white tenants. As stated in HUD's letter, Carbrook violated provisions of the law requiring cooperation with HUD's investigation into these concerns of systemic racial and national origin discrimination.
Since 1981, Carbrook has received federal housing funds to provide affordable housing to income-qualifying families in Brooklyn, New York. In the ten-year period prior to HUD's findings, Carbrook received over $11.5 million in Project-Based Rental Assistance from HUD to operate two affordable multifamily housing developments.
""HUD is committed to ensuring that individuals with disabilities, racial minorities and other underserved communities have an equal opportunity, as guaranteed by federal law, to enjoy accessible, affordable housing."" said Jeanine Worden, HUD's Acting Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will not tolerate housing providers taking federal housing funds while shirking their civil rights obligations and refusing to cooperate with federal civil rights investigations.""
In January, President Biden issued a Memorandum to the Secretary (www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/26/memorandum-on-redressing-our-nations-and-the-federal-governments-history-of-discriminatory-housing-practices-and-policies/), charging HUD to take actions to overcome and redress this Nation's history of housing discrimination by applying and enforcing Federal civil rights and fair housing laws. This action is one step toward undoing historic patterns of segregation and other types of discrimination that have long denied equitable access to housing opportunity.
Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504) prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance and requires that recipients of federal financial assistance bring their programs and activities into compliance with federal accessibility requirements. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI) prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin in any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.
HUD's letter notifies Carbrook that HUD is proceeding to suspend, terminate, and refuse to grant federal financial assistance due to Carbrook's noncompliance with Section 504 and Title VI. Carbrook may request that HUD initiate an administrative hearing regarding this matter within twenty (20) calendar days of the date of the letter. During the pendency of such proceeding, HUD will defer all federal financial assistance it currently provides to Carbrook. Carbrook may avoid these actions if it signs a voluntary compliance agreement under Section 504 and fully cooperates with HUD's Title VI investigation.
HUD is notifying tenants of the Carbrook properties that federal civil rights laws prohibit intimidation and retaliation against tenants, including threatening eviction or withholding maintenance services, because of HUD's action. The notification states that the terms and services of tenancy, including the amount of rental payment, should not immediately change due to this action.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 877-8339 (Federal Relay Service)."
04/14/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-061.cfm,"Secretary Fudge, Governor Lamont, Mayor Bowser Discuss American Rescue Plan Homelessness Assistance Allocations","WASHINGTON - Today, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Marcia L. Fudge, along with Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont and Washington, DC Mayor Muriel Bowser, held a Zoom call to discuss the nearly $5 billion in American Rescue Plan funds allocated by HUD to help communities across the country create affordable housing and services for people experiencing or at risk of experiencing homelessness.
The supplemental funding, known as HOME-ARP, was provided by the American Rescue Plan, which was enacted into law on March 11, 2021, and is allocated through the HOME Investment Partnerships Program to 651 grantees, including states, insular areas, and local governments. Click here for a full list.
""The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored just how important it is for every person to have access to safe and stable housing,"" said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""This $5 billion in homelessness assistance provided by the American Rescue Plan will deliver much-needed resources for communities to give homes to the people who have had to endure the pandemic without one. In the days ahead, we need to build on this relief with President Biden's American Jobs Plan - a once-in-a-generation opportunity needed to bring our country closer to ending homelessness and housing instability.""
""I thank Secretary Fudge and the Biden-Harris Administration for this new funding to Connecticut,"" said Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont. ""The federal HOME Investment Partnership program is a vital tool we are using to move our homeless population off the streets and out of shelters and into permanent housing. We've made progress in Connecticut despite the pandemic. But we must do more as a state and a nation. Together with new state investments in affordable housing, this new funding to Connecticut from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development will support our ongoing work to end homelessness and to Build Back Better from this pandemic.""
""This investment signals that the Biden Administration is serious about helping Americans recover and heal from the extraordinary circumstances this pandemic has caused,"" said DC Mayor Muriel Bowser. ""Here in DC, we have been very focused on making homelessness rare, brief, and nonrecurring. With the local investments we've made, we are proud of our progress - we've been able to reduce overall homelessness by 11% and family homelessness by 85%. But we also know that the pandemic, and the economic crisis it caused, puts those gains at risk. And we know that to really tackle this issue and to overcome the housing crisis, we need serious federal investments. And that's what this is, and we thank Secretary Fudge for leading the effort to get these funds out the door and into communities that need them.""
The $4.925 billion in HOME-ARP funding gives states the flexibility to best meet the needs of people experiencing or at risk of experiencing homelessness, including through development of affordable and supportive housing, tenant-based rental assistance, supportive services, and acquisition and development of non-congregate shelter units. Funds must be spent by 2030.
The nearly $5 billion in HOME-ARP funding is the first of two homelessness-related funding opportunities from the American Rescue Plan that HUD will release. In the coming weeks, HUD will announce the allocation of funding for emergency vouchers for people experiencing and at-risk of homelessness.
The American Jobs Plan (www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/31/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan/), introduced on March 31, 2021, calls for a more than $200 billion investment to increase housing supply and address the affordable housing crisis."
04/15/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-062.cfm,HUD Announces $41 Million Funding Opportunity to Provide Stable Housing to Low-Income Persons Living with HIV and their Families,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is making $41 million in Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) competitive funding available to states, local governments, and non-profits through the HOPWA: Housing as an Intervention to Fight AIDS funding opportunity. Housing instability has been a major issue facing many persons living with HIV since the beginning of the epidemic. Achieving and maintaining stable housing can be a powerful structural intervention in ending the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Read HUD's Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) (www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=332870).
""We know safe, stable housing is critical for persons living with HIV to best manage their health,"" said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""This funding will support communities in ensuring our neighbors are able to access housing alongside medical services. We cannot end the HIV/AIDS epidemic without support for housing.""
Through this NOFO, HUD will provide funding for housing assistance and supportive services for low-income persons living with HIV and their families, coordination and planning activities, and grants management and administration. Selected communities will implement new projects that elevate housing as an effective structural intervention and align with initiatives aimed at ending the HIV/AIDS epidemic. HUD is seeking projects with exemplary and innovative qualities, including community-level coordination, data collection with emphasis on stable housing and positive health outcomes, culturally competent approaches to providing housing and services, and a systemic approach to advance equity in underserved communities that can serve as a national place-based model.
Projects funded through this HOPWA funding opportunity will achieve six required project objectives: (1) Implement and document housing and services models for low-income persons living with HIV and their families that are innovative and replicable in other similar localities or nationally; (2) Increase alignment with new or existing local initiatives or strategies to end the HIV/AIDS epidemic by elevating housing as an effective structural intervention; (3) Improve coordination among local housing and service providers and use of available community resources; (4) Increase the amount of quality data collected and used for data-driven decision making with an emphasis on stable housing, positive health outcomes, and racial equity; (5) Assess and document replicable practices that ensure equitable access and culturally competent approaches to providing housing and services for subpopulations of persons living with HIV experiencing service gaps; and (6) Prioritize sustainable, effective, and equitable approaches to providing housing and services to persons living with HIV and their families that can be continued past the funded project's period of performance.
HUD will publish a pre-application webcast by April 30, 2021 for anyone interested in submitting an application for the HOPWA: Housing as an Intervention to Fight AIDS funding opportunity. The webcast will cover the information in the NOFO. More information on the webcast will be provided through the HUD.gov HOPWA mailing list. To sign up for the mailing list, please visit the HUD.gov HOPWA mailing list subscription page.
The HOPWA program is the only Federal program dedicated to addressing the housing needs of persons living with HIV/AIDS and their families. Grantees partner with nonprofit organizations and housing agencies to provide housing and support to program beneficiaries."

Kit Carson, Colorado will receive a $500,000 grant to redevelop two sites, the City of El Cerrito, California will receive a $500,000 grant to build affordable, residential units in the city's commercial district, and the City of Stayton, Oregon will receive a $500,000 grant to rehabilitate two buildings. The grants are funded through HUD's HOPE VI Main Street Program.
""Providing affordable housing and increasing economic opportunities are what Mainstreet funding is all about,"" said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""Partnering with our local communities to renovate and rebuild neighborhoods like those in Kit Carson, El Cerrito, and Stayton helps to revitalize smaller cities and towns into thriving and sustainable communities.""
HUD's Main Street program seeks to rejuvenate older, downtown business districts while retaining the area's traditional and historic character by providing grants to smaller communities for the development of affordable housing undertaken in connection with an ongoing Main Street revitalization effort. Under Main Street, obsolete commercial offices or buildings can be reconfigured into revenue-producing affordable housing.
The Town of Kit Carson, Colorado will facilitate development of two affordable housing sites. These projects represent the culmination of a larger effort to expand the development of the Town's Main Street area and provide more affordable housing in this community of 233 residents.
The City of El Cerrito, in Contra Costa County, California, encompasses 3.9 square miles and is part of the San Francisco Bay Area - Northern California region. Main Street funding will help facilitate the construction of 67 affordable units. This project will contribute to revitalizing the Uptown commercial district while fulfilling the goals of the city's Affordable Housing Strategy by providing affordable units to very-low-income households.
The City of Stayton, Oregon will facilitate the development of residential units in the Diedrich Building and in the former Jensen-Krietzer Department store. The renovation of these two buildings in Stayton's historic North Third Avenue corridor is the result of a long-term effort to revitalize the North Third Avenue Corridor that came together when the City Council adopted a Downtown Revitalization Plan for this community of 7,800 residents."

Specifically, the DHA failed to transfer a tenant with a mobility disability to a ground-floor unit, forcing her to leave her wheelchair and crawl up or down the stairs in order to access or leave her housing. Read HUD's Letter of Findings.
""When the housing authority failed to provide this tenant with a ground floor unit, it violated her civil rights, subjected her to indignity, and interfered with her independent use and enjoyment of housing,"" said Jeanine Worden, HUD's Acting Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Reasonable accommodations are essential to ensuring that individuals with disabilities have equal opportunity to enjoy and benefit from housing. HUD will vigorously enforce civil rights laws to ensure that individuals with disabilities served by HUD's public housing programs are not subjected to discrimination.""
Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by public housing agencies and other recipients of HUD funding. Recipients must bring their programs, activities, and facilities into compliance with federal accessibility requirements. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) also prohibits public entities from discriminating on the basis of disability in all services, activities, and programs, whether or not they receive federal funds.
The case originally came to HUD's attention when the tenant filed a complaint alleging that she had been discriminated against on the basis of her disability. HUD's investigation also revealed that the housing authority unlawfully evicted the tenant in retaliation for her efforts to obtain a reasonable accommodation.
People who believe they have experienced housing discrimination or discrimination in any other program or activity funded by HUD may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 877-8339 (Federal Relay Service)."
04/19/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-065.cfm,HUD Announces Winners of 2021 Innovation in Affordable Housing Student Design and Planning Competition,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced a graduate student team with members from Pratt Institute and New York University as the winners of HUD's eighth annual Innovation in Affordable Housing Student Design and Planning Competition (www.huduser.gov/portal/challenge/home.html). For the 2021 competition, HUD partnered with Fresno Housing in Fresno County, California.
The combined Pratt Institute and New York University team was one of four finalist teams challenged with the redevelopment of housing units and seizing the opportunity to create one cohesive community from five contiguous properties. The five properties, although adjacent to one another, are currently separated by fences. These barriers are not only physically unappealing; they contribute to the larger disconnectedness of the entire community. The student teams were challenged to build a workforce housing plan that included the redesign of over 210 housing units for farm laborers, migrant workers, senior citizens, and low-income families in Firebaugh, California.
HUD also announced a team of students from the University of Michigan and Harvard University as runner-up for their understanding of a detailed financing scheme, as well as their attention to phasing for onsite relocation.
""The students here today have made a case for new and forward-thinking strategies that help to expand affordable housing opportunities for all families through innovative design,"" said Jenn Jones, Chief of Staff, Office of the Secretary. ""On behalf of Secretary Fudge and the Department, I want to congratulate all the students who participated in HUD's Innovation in Affordable Housing Competition, and I want to ask the students to keep up your enthusiasm for the work. We need your ideas, we need your creativity, and we need your energy if we are going to be able to meet the affordable housing challenges that we are seeing today. The Secretary and I are excited to see what you do next.""
Mr. Michael Duarte, Chief Real Estate Officer at Fresno Housing, also commended the students' hard work and contribution to finding innovative solutions to affordable housing challenges in the rural community of Firebaugh. ""Our team was impressed with each of the final four presentations and offers our congratulations to the Pratt Institute/New York University team who innovatively incorporated feedback from residents and local experts into their final project,"" said Duarte. ""We look forward to reviewing the proposal in greater detail and working with the Firebaugh community to determine if this inclusive vision can be implemented.""
HUD's Innovation in Affordable Housing competition strives to spur research, collaboration, and creativity in affordable housing and community development. This year's challenge required multidisciplinary teams composed of graduate students in architecture, planning and policy, finance, and other areas to address social, economic, environmental, design, financial, and construction issues in addition to the affordable housing design challenge.
On April 14, 2021, student teams presented their final projects to a jury of practitioners via a live virtual platform. The Pratt Institute/New York University team will receive a $20,000 award, and the runner-up team from the University of Michigan/Harvard University will receive a $10,000 award. The two remaining finalist teams, Columbia University and the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, will each receive $5,000.
The competition jurors praised the winning team for their comprehensive financial package as well as their attention to innovation and environmental sustainability. The team was also praised for their plan to reuse an existing property, La Joya Commons, in the Firebaugh development.
Rob Hazelton, the Head Juror and CEO of Dominion Due Diligence Group, said about the winning team from Pratt Institute and New York University: ""This is the only team that reused La Joya Commons, which the housing authority has already invested about $1.4 million into redevelopment efforts, plans, designs and approvals. I appreciate that they actually reused the plan and thought about reuse and rebuild very purposefully. Their financial plan was also very purposeful. I believe this was the most innovative design we were presented with; it was a breathable full-blown community.""
By initiating and funding this competition, HUD hopes to inspire and support aspiring members of fields such as architecture, planning, policy, and finance in advancing affordable and sustainable housing for low- and moderate-income Americans."
04/19/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-066.cfm,HUD Accelerates Access to Puerto Rico Disaster Relief Funds,"WASHINGTON - The Department of Housing and Urban Development today announced the obligation of $8.2 billion in Community Development Block Grant Mitigation (CDBG-MIT) funds for Puerto Rico, along with the removal of onerous restrictions unique to Puerto Rico that limited the island's access to CDBG-DR recovery funds that were allocated following Hurricane Maria in September 2017. These actions are the latest in an ongoing whole-of-government effort to support the island's recovery and renewal.
""Since its first days, the Biden-Harris Administration has prioritized action to enable stronger recovery for Puerto Rico,"" said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""The actions taken by HUD today will unlock access to funds Puerto Rico needs to recover from past disasters and build resilience to future storms, while ensuring transparency and accountability. We are committed to an ongoing partnership with Puerto Rico to empower the island's communities and help them build back better.""
Among the onerous restrictions removed by HUD are the incremental grant obligations (or tranche structure) and review by the Federal Financial Monitor. HUD also removed the requirement for Puerto Rico to request and submit any certification, observations, and recommendations by the Financial Oversight and Management Board, beyond what is already required by law.
Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) funds enable grantees to address significant unmet needs for long-term recovery, including disaster relief, long-term recovery, restoration of infrastructure, housing, and economic revitalization. CDBG Mitigation (CDBG-MIT) Program funds can be used in areas impacted by recent disasters to carry out strategic and high-impact activities to mitigate disaster risk and reduce future losses."
04/19/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-067.cfm,Federal Housing Administration Revises Standard Single Family Servicing Policies,"WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) today announced the publication of its update to the Servicing and Loss Mitigation section of the FHA Single Family Housing Policy Handbook 4000.1. This update streamlines many standard operational requirements for mortgage servicers, including revising FHA's loss mitigation home retention ""waterfall"" so that servicers can more quickly offer effective loss mitigation home retention options to borrowers in danger of losing their homes to foreclosure. Additional changes streamline and enhance many servicing requirements to provide more consistency with industry practices and reduce barriers to servicing FHA-insured single family mortgages.
""With these updates, we have strengthened the ability of servicers to reach and help more struggling borrowers with FHA-insured mortgages, more quickly,"" said Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Housing Lopa Kolluri. ""The updates to our policies will ensure quality servicing activities, streamline servicing requirements, more closely align our servicing policies with industry servicing practices, and improve outcomes.""
The changes contained in the updated Section III of the FHA Single Family Housing Policy Handbook 4000.1 published today are based on rigorous internal analysis and extensive public feedback and will improve the effectiveness and efficiency of FHA's servicing policies. The updates incorporate the actions FHA has already taken to support borrowers who are experiencing financial hardship due to COVID-19. The changes include:
A revised loss mitigation waterfall that allows servicers to review struggling borrowers for a permanent FHA Home Affordable Modification Program (FHA-HAMP) home retention option without a lengthy forbearance, which has been proven to be highly effective at helping borrowers avoid redefault and foreclosure; Streamlined documentation requirements to avoid unnecessary delays and to align more closely with standard industry servicing practices, including removing signature requirements on Trial Payment Plans; and A revised structure for certain allowable costs and fees that corresponds with fee structures used by other industry participants.
• A revised loss mitigation waterfall that allows servicers to review struggling borrowers for a permanent FHA Home Affordable Modification Program (FHA-HAMP) home retention option without a lengthy forbearance, which has been proven to be highly effective at helping borrowers avoid redefault and foreclosure;
• Streamlined documentation requirements to avoid unnecessary delays and to align more closely with standard industry servicing practices, including removing signature requirements on Trial Payment Plans; and
• A revised structure for certain allowable costs and fees that corresponds with fee structures used by other industry participants.
""The work completed today responds to feedback we've received about the complexity and cost of servicing FHA-insured mortgages,"" said Acting Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary for Single Family Housing Julie Shaffer. ""FHA requirements will continue to reflect our high expectations of servicers and updating our processes and addressing outdated and unnecessary requirements will improve the program for borrowers and servicers."""
04/20/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-068.cfm,HUD Charges Texas Rental Property Owner with Discriminating Against Family with Children,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that is charging an owner of a six-bedroom rental home in Frisco, Texas, with violating the Fair Housing Act by refusing to rent to a woman and her ten children. HUD's charge alleges that the owner stated that he could not rent the home to a family with eleven people, even though the mother, a HUD Housing Choice Voucher recipient, was qualified to rent the home. Read HUD's charge.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to refuse to rent to a family because of children under the age of 18 and to make statements that discriminate against families with children. This includes making statements or publishing advertisements that indicate a preference or otherwise discriminate against families with children. Housing may exclude children only if it meets the Fair Housing Act's exemption for housing for older persons.
""Large families have a hard enough time finding suitable housing that meets their needs without also having to face unlawful discrimination,"" said Jeanine Worden, HUD's Acting Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue working to ensure that housing providers comply with the nation's housing laws.""
""Families come in all sizes, and all are worthy of protection under the law,"" said Damon Smith, HUD's Principal Deputy General Counsel. ""HUD is committed to advocating on behalf of families with children to allow them to secure housing free from discrimination.""
The case came to HUD's attention when the woman filed a complaint with the Texas Workforce Commission, a HUD Fair Housing Assistance Program agency, alleging that she was denied the opportunity to rent the home because of the number of children she has. HUD's charge alleges that the owner initially contacted the mother through GoSection8.com, telling her about his ""beautiful 5,095 square-foot home for rent in Frisco."" The charge further alleges that when the woman told the owner that she has ten children, he told her that was too many children and refused to rent to the family. The family ultimately moved to a smaller rental home with fewer bedrooms in a different city.
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party elects for the case to be heard in federal court. If the administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, the judge may award damages to the complainant for losses that have resulted from the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties in order to vindicate the public interest.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 877-8339 (Relay). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to hud.gov/fairhousing, or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple and Android devices."
04/22/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-069.cfm,"HUD Withdraws Proposed Rule, Reaffirms Its Commitment to Equal Access to Housing, Shelters, and Other Services Regardless of Gender Identity","WASHINGTON - U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Marcia L. Fudge on Thursday announced that HUD is withdrawing the previous administration's proposed rule that would have weakened the Equal Access Rule. The Equal Access Rule ensures that all individuals - regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity-have equal access to the Department's Office of Community Planning and Development programs, shelters, other buildings and facilities, benefits, services, and accommodations.
""Access to safe, stable housing-and shelter-is a basic necessity,"" said Secretary Fudge. ""Unfortunately, transgender and gender non-conforming people report more instances of housing instability and homelessness than cis-gender people. Today, we are taking a critical step in affirming HUD's commitment that no person be denied access to housing or other critical services because of their gender identity. HUD is open for business for all.""
The previous administration refused to fully implement the Equal Access Rule and proposed a rule in 2020 that would have allowed shelter programs and operators to subject transgender individuals to inappropriate and intrusive inquiries, deny them accommodations, and subject them to greater harassment.
HUD has submitted its action withdrawing that rule to the Federal Register, which is expected to publish it next week. This action reaffirms HUD's mission and commitment to creating inclusive communities and quality housing for all. Excluding any eligible person from HUD's Office of Community Planning and Development funded emergency shelters, temporary housing, buildings, housing, or programs because of a person's gender identity is counter to HUD's mission.
Along with this announcement, HUD is releasing technical assistance resources prepared by technical assistance providers to HUD grantees. These resources will support HUD's Office of Community Planning and Development grantees in implementing the Equal Access Rule. Read the Equal Access technical assistance materials for shelter operators here (www.hudexchange.info/resource/4959/equal-access-for-transgender-people-supporting-inclusive-housing-and-shelters) and here (www.hudexchange.info/resource/4951/equal-access-staff-training-scenarios/).
Background
The 2016 CPD Equal Access Rule requires that HUD grantees funded in whole or in part by any Office of Community Planning and Development (CPD) program ensure equal access to community planning and development programs, shelters, other buildings and facilities, benefits, services, and accommodations. Grantees must ensure shelter access be provided to a person in accordance with that person's gender identity, and in a manner that affords equal access to the person's family. The 2016 Equal Access Rule further ensures that, when consideration of sex is prohibited or not relevant, individuals will not be discriminated against based on actual or perceived gender identity, and where legitimate consideration of sex or gender is appropriate-for example, for shelters that serve only one sex or otherwise operate in a sex-segregated way-the individual's own self-identified gender identity will govern.
On July 24, 2020, the previous administration proposed a rule entitled ""Making Admission or Placement Determinations Based on Sex in Facilities Under Community Planning and Development Housing Programs"". This proposed rule, if finalized, would have significantly undermined the 2016 CPD Equal Access Rule.
The proposed 2020 Shelter Rule would have allowed for HUD-sanctioned, federally funded discrimination against transgender people, who face disproportionately high rates of homelessness and extreme risk in unsheltered homelessness.
First, the rule would have allowed HUD CPD-funded shelters and other facilities to create policies excluding transgender and gender non-conforming people from being placed in single-sex facilities that aligned with those persons' gender identities. This would have created insurmountable barriers to shelter access for transgender and gender non-conforming people who already face serious discrimination and difficulty in safely accessing shelters.
Second, the rule would have allowed CPD grant funding recipients, subrecipients, owners, operators, managers, and providers to overrule the gender identity proffered by a person seeking shelter and make their determination about that person's gender. It allowed CPD funding recipients to focus solely on a person's sex assigned at birth and then assess that based on physical factors such as height and the presence of facial hair. This intrusive and humiliating inquiry would be inflicted on the especially vulnerable people experiencing homelessness, many of whom have experienced sexual assault or other trauma.
Equal access to HUD programs that serve people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness is essential in addressing the challenges faced by transgender and gender non-conforming persons. National research has indicated that denials of access to shelters for transgender and gender non-conforming persons based upon gender identity are commonplace. Transgender women reported being excluded from women's shelters at high rates. In one key study, transgender housing testers called shelters in four states to ask about where they would be housed. According to a study conducted by the Center for American Progress and the Equal Rights Center, only 30 percent of the shelters contacted by the testers were prepared to house transgender women with other women, as would have been appropriate.
Transgender and gender non-conforming persons face enormous safety risks in shelters. According to a national survey by the National Center for Transgender Equality, nearly half (47 percent) of all transgender respondents who accessed shelters left those shelters because of the treatment they received there-choosing to live on the streets over the abuse and indignity they experienced in a shelter. This survey further reported that 25 percent of transgender persons who stayed in shelters were physically assaulted and 22 percent were sexually assaulted in shelters. These assaults were perpetrated by both shelter residents and staff."

Fudge held a Zoom call to discuss the nearly $5 billion in American Rescue Plan funds allocated by HUD to help communities across the country create affordable housing and services for people experiencing or at risk of experiencing homelessness. Secretary Fudge was joined on the call by House Financial Services Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters, Colorado Governor Jared Polis, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan, and San Francisco Mayor London Breed.
The supplemental funding, known as HOME-ARP, was provided by the American Rescue Plan, which was enacted into law on March 11, 2021, and is allocated through the HOME Investment Partnerships Program to 651 grantees, including states, insular areas, and local governments. Click here for a full list.
""We cannot stand by when a single person in this country - let alone more than half a million people - is without a safe, stable place to call home. That is why the Biden-Harris Administration has acted swiftly and aggressively to protect and support people experiencing or at-risk of experiencing homelessness,"" said Secretary Fudge. ""While this $5 billion in homelessness assistance in the American Rescue Plan will deliver near-term relief to people experiencing or at risk of experiencing homelessness during the pandemic, the President's once-in-a-generation American Jobs Plan would build on this relief with additional robust funding for the affordable housing needing to bring the United States closer to ending homelessness and housing instability.""
""I applaud Secretary Fudge, President Biden, and the Biden Administration for the outstanding work they have done on the American Rescue Plan to deliver essential relief to individuals, families and communities during the pandemic crisis,"" said Chairwoman Waters. ""One of my key priorities as Chairwoman of the Financial Services Committee is to address the shameful homelessness crisis, which has been worsened by the pandemic. I am pleased that American Rescue Plan Act provides $5 billion in funding for homeless assistance through the HOME program, and that President Biden has made investment in housing infrastructure and affordable housing a key component of his American Jobs Plan. I am looking forward to working with the Biden Administration both to advance legislation to implement the American Jobs Plan and on my Ending Homelessness Act this Congress.""
""So many people have endured a tremendous amount of hardship this year, some people even lost their homes. As Colorado builds back stronger from this pandemic, it's critical that everyone in our state and nation has the opportunity to call a place home,"" said Governor Polis. ""These funds from the American Rescue Plan will offer direct, immediate results and pave the way for long-term solutions to end homelessness. I thank the Biden-Harris administration and Secretary Fudge for their efforts to deliver relief when Coloradans, and all of America, need it most.""
""The $5 billion in HOME funding from the American Rescue Plan has opened the door to a tectonic shift in our ability to bring our unhoused neighbors indoors,"" said Mayor Garcetti. ""Thanks to the leadership of Secretary Fudge and the Biden-Harris administration, our City will add nearly $100 million to our local efforts to bring more shelters, permanent housing, and critical services online -- and enable us to dedicate a record-setting $1 billion toward the fight to confront and end homelessness in Los Angeles.""
""With the American Rescue Plan, President Biden is leading with partnership to support cities who have served as the only safety net for our most vulnerable communities over the past four years. Over the several meetings with HUD, Secretary Fudge's commitment to Seattle and addressing homelessness, especially chronic homelessness, is clear and unwavering. Her leadership will help address our communities' most immediate needs over the coming months,"" said Mayor Durkan. ""In Seattle, recently we have taken some important steps, capitalizing on the downturn in the real estate market to add more affordable housing for our neighbors experiencing homelessness. For our longer-term recovery, we have the opportunity with the American Rescue Plan and HOME funds to scale up innovative investments to shelter and house even more, more quickly than ever before.""
""To tackle the significant and complex challenges facing our city around housing and homelessness, we need real and substantial federal leadership. That's what we are getting from President Biden and the American Rescue Plan, and from the HOME program, which is providing badly needed resources to help us support our most vulnerable residents,"" said Mayor Breed. ""While it's critical we invest in long-term solutions like permanent housing, we also need to find creative interim housing solutions to keep people safe. I appreciate Secretary Fudge's understanding of these challenges and the willingness of HUD to provide the flexibility and resources we need to respond to the crisis of unsheltered homelessness.""
The $4.925 billion in HOME-ARP funding gives states the flexibility to best meet the needs of people experiencing or at risk of experiencing homelessness, including through development of affordable and supportive housing, tenant-based rental assistance, supportive services, and acquisition and development of non-congregate shelter units. Funds must be spent by 2030.
The nearly $5 billion in HOME-ARP funding is the first of two homelessness-related funding opportunities from the American Rescue Plan that HUD will release. In the coming weeks, HUD will announce the allocation of funding for emergency vouchers for people experiencing and at-risk of homelessness.
The American Jobs Plan (www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/31/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan), introduced on March 31, 2021, calls for a more than $200 billion investment to increase housing supply and address the affordable housing crisis.
In March, HUD released its 2020 Annual Homeless Assessment Report Part 1 to Congress (www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/ahar/2020-ahar-part-1-pit-estimates-of-homelessness-in-the-us.html), which found that more than 580,000 people experienced homelessness in the United States on a single night in 2020."

Fudge announced that HUD will substantially increase housing inspections, beginning on June 1, 2021.
HUD's inspections are instrumental in identifying unsafe conditions and supporting HUD's work with housing providers to mitigate them. Thirteen months ago, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and in line with public health guidance, HUD took many steps to protect HUD-assisted households and the people who provide that assistance from exposure to COVID-19. Among those steps was the suspension of most in-person housing inspections by the Real Estate Assessment Center (REAC) last year along with waivers that enabled Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) and Multifamily housing owners and managers to reduce activities that could contribute to COVID-19 transmission.
In consultation with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and in alignment with HUD's prioritization of the overall health and well-being of HUD-assisted households, PHAs, multifamily housing owners and property managers were informed on Friday that HUD has developed detailed protocols guiding all aspects of the inspection process.
""The last year has shown just how important housing is to our health and safety,"" said Secretary Fudge. ""More than a year since the pandemic began and with every person over the age of 16 now being eligible for a free COVID-19 vaccination, we must take steps to ensure the whole health and well-being of the households we serve—including the conditions and quality of housing. We look forward to working with residents to ensure safe and successful inspections.""
HUD, in collaboration with the CDC, will implement additional protocols and associated safety measures, including:
The inspection of high priority/risk properties for both the Public Housing and Multifamily portfolios before other properties; Evaluation of known property-specific health conditions prior to the inspection; Regular COVID-19 testing of inspectors and efforts to facilitate the vaccination of inspectors; Travel and quarantine guidelines for inspectors; Detailed operational protocols for inspectors pre-inspection, during the inspection, and post-inspection reviewed by the CDC; Ability for residents to opt-out of unit inspections when inspectors arrive on-site.
• The inspection of high priority/risk properties for both the Public Housing and Multifamily portfolios before other properties;
• Evaluation of known property-specific health conditions prior to the inspection;
• Regular COVID-19 testing of inspectors and efforts to facilitate the vaccination of inspectors;
• Travel and quarantine guidelines for inspectors;
• Detailed operational protocols for inspectors pre-inspection, during the inspection, and post-inspection reviewed by the CDC;
• Ability for residents to opt-out of unit inspections when inspectors arrive on-site.
Additionally, under the CARES Act, PHAs and Multifamily POAs may purchase and make available to residents PPE, which HUD strongly encourages prior to an inspection."

EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take three months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, six months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as “2.5 percent (±3.2 percent) above” appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percentage change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percentage changes are 90 percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percentage changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised 3 percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau's website (www.census.gov/construction/nrs/how_the_data_are_collected/index.html)."

See chart below of today's funding announcement.
Awarded through HUD's Jobs Plus program, these grants support work readiness and connect public housing residents with employment, education, and financial empowerment services -part of an evidence-based model proven to help public housing residents find and keep jobs. Read more about how these PHAs will put their grant funds to work.
""Providing resources so that public housing residents can achieve economic and housing stability is an important part of HUD's mission,"" said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""HUD is committed to empowering and working with our local partners to help residents reach their goals and uplift their families.""
The Jobs Plus program expands on a successful demonstration program model that combines traditional employment, training, and job placement services with a rent incentive and a place-based investment in building community support for work. The program requires PHAs to partner locally with Department of Labor Workforce Development Boards and American Jobs Centers. Additionally, Jobs Plus grantees are required to demonstrate a 25 percent match from community partners, providing wrap-around supportive services to improve employment and earnings outcomes. Cross-agency partnerships are essential to changing the economic prospects of public housing residents. Jobs Plus's place-based model helps residents support each other through the process, cultivating a culture of work and enhancing economic resiliency.

04/28/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-074.cfm,HUD Charges Alabama Landlord with Housing Discrimination,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is charging an owner of an apartment complex in Florence, Alabama, with violating the Fair Housing Act by refusing to rent a unit to a prospective tenant with disabilities who uses an assistance animal. Read HUD's charge.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from discriminating against people with disabilities, including refusing to make reasonable accommodations in policies or practices when such accommodations may be necessary to provide them an equal opportunity to use or enjoy a dwelling. This includes permitting persons with disabilities to have service or assistance animals. Housing providers may not prohibit people with disabilities from having assistance animals that perform work or tasks, or that provide disability-related emotional support. That means a housing provider that otherwise enforces a ""no-pets"" policy must waive it for a prospective renter or resident who needs an assistance animal because of a disability.
""Refusing to permit individuals who rely on assistance animals to live with their animals not only prevents them from obtaining housing they desperately need, it is also against the law,"" said Jeanine Worden, HUD's Acting Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD remains committed to ensuring that housing providers recognize and meet their obligation to comply with the Fair Housing Act, including its reasonable accommodation requirements.""
""When housing providers refuse to waive ""no-pets"" policies for prospective renters or residents who rely on assistance animals, they are violating the Fair Housing Act,"" said Damon Smith, Principal Deputy General Counsel for HUD's Office of General Counsel. ""HUD will continue to enforce the Act on behalf of persons with disabilities who are denied reasonable accommodations needed to use and enjoy their homes.""
According to the HUD charge, a woman who uses an assistance animal filed a complaint with HUD after she was denied the opportunity to rent an apartment she saw online because of the owner's ""no-pets"" policy. When the woman called to inquire about the unit, the owner allegedly asked if she had a pet, and when the woman stated she had an assistance animal, the owner told her that she did not allow pets or animals and terminated the call.
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless either party elects for the case to be heard in federal court. If the administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, the judge may award damages to the complainant for losses that have resulted from the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties in order to vindicate the public interest.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 877-8339 (Relay).

Fudge on Thursday announced awards to nine lead public housing authorities (PHAs) that will participate in HUD's new Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) Mobility Demonstration, which will receive$45.7 million in total funding. Through this Demonstration, PHAs will provide over 10,000 families with children better access to low-poverty neighborhoods with high-performing schools and other strong community resources. Participating regions represent diverse housing markets, population sizes, local laws regarding source-of-income nondiscrimination, and experiences implementing housing mobility programs.
""Studies show that place matters, and access to educational opportunities and other resources create lasting impacts on life outcomes for children,"" said Dominique Blom, General Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing. ""The Mobility Demonstration provides families the choice to live where they want to live to raise their children."" ""We are thrilled to announce this new program, which will remove barriers to opportunity-rich communities for families across the country.""
The Demonstration builds upon recent research that shows growing up in neighborhoods with lower levels of poverty improves children's academic achievement and long-term chances of success and reduces intergenerational poverty. Children who move to low-poverty neighborhoods have also been shown to experience lower rates of hospitalizations, lower hospital spending, and some changes in mental health over the long-term follow-up. Adults given the chance to move to low-poverty neighborhoods experience reductions in obesity and diabetes.
While the HCV program currently offers families with vouchers the opportunity to live in a neighborhood of their choice (including low-poverty, opportunity neighborhoods), families with HCVs may continue to encounter barriers to using their vouchers in communities with expanded opportunities. Common barriers include inability to save enough money for a security deposit, inadequate time to find a unit, landlord unwillingness to rent to voucher holders, or limited awareness of neighborhood amenities, such as the location of high-performing schools.
The Housing Choice Voucher Mobility Demonstration will support selected PHAs in addressing barriers to accessing housing choices by offering mobility-related services to increase the number of voucher families with children living in opportunity areas. In addition to offering mobility-related services, participating PHAs will work together in their regions to adopt administrative policies that further enable housing mobility, increase landlord participation, and reduce barriers for families to move across PHA jurisdictions through portability.
The Demonstration will face a rigorous, independent evaluation to determine what services are most effective at helping families move to opportunity areas. HUD also intends to make materials developed for the demonstration available to all PHAs for us in their own communities.
The following PHAs will receive funding for the HCV Mobility Demonstration:

The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination against people because of their national origin, including in residential real estate-related transactions. This includes selling unfair or fraudulent loan products that target certain individuals because of their national origin.
""For many families, homeownership represents the culmination of a dream, and the realization of that dream shouldn't be put in jeopardy by unscrupulous actors and unlawful practices,"" said Jeanine Worden, HUD's Acting Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Today's action reaffirms HUD's commitment to ensuring that no family is saddled with fraudulent mortgage products that threaten their ability to stay in their home because of their nationality.""
""The Fair Housing Act protects homeowners who reach out for assistance in times of need from predatory practices that instead increase the likelihood that the homeowners will lose their home,"" said Damon Smith, HUD's Principal Deputy General Counsel. ""HUD is working to protect homeowners from discriminatory schemes like this.""
The case came to HUD's attention when multiple Hispanic homeowners filed complaints with HUD alleging that they had been the victims of a loan modification scam. The charge alleges that the homeowners initially learned about the loan modification service through advertisements on a Spanish-language radio station which claimed that THL helped hundreds of people successfully modify their mortgages. When the homeowners contacted THL, THL agents allegedly provided inaccurate information about the application requirements, procedures and standards for review for loan modification requests, and misrepresented that so long as the homeowners withheld their mortgage payments and remained in default, their banks would be compelled to modify their loan.
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party elects for the case to be heard in federal court. If the administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, the judge may award damages to the complainants for losses that have resulted from the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties to vindicate the public interest.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 877-8339 (Relay). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to hud.gov/fairhousing."

05/03/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-079.cfm,HUD Observes Mental Health Awareness Month with Launch of New Education Campaign,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is commemorating Mental Health Awareness Month 2021 this May with the launch of a new campaign that will educate the public about the various forms of housing discrimination people with mental health, intellectual or developmental disabilities often face, and what they should do if they believe their housing rights have been violated.
The new education and outreach campaign consists of social media graphics, as well as fact sheets for individuals with mental health, intellectual, or developmental disabilities, and housing providers, informing them of their fair housing rights and responsibilities under the Fair Housing Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and the Americans with Disabilities Act. Informational materials will also inform people about how to file a discrimination complaint with HUD.
""Individuals with mental health, intellectual, and developmental disabilities are protected under federal fair housing and nondiscrimination laws and cannot be denied housing or subjected to other discrimination because of their disability,"" said Jeanine Worden, HUD's Acting Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""As May is Mental Health Awareness Month, HUD is informing the public about the housing rights of persons with mental health disabilities and reminding housing providers of their obligation to comply with laws protecting those rights.""
The Fair Housing Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and the Americans with Disabilities Act prohibit housing discrimination against individuals with disabilities, including individuals with mental health, intellectual or developmental disabilities. These laws require that individuals with disabilities be provided the same housing opportunities as those provided to individuals without disabilities. Individuals with disabilities also have the right to receive reasonable accommodations, which are exceptions, adjustments, or modifications to rules, policies, practices, and services that may be necessary for them to have an equal opportunity to enjoy and use their housing. One common type of reasonable accommodation individuals with mental health disabilities may need is an assistance animal that provides them with disability-related support. Unfortunately, housing providers often fail to understand that they must make exceptions to ""no-pets"" policies and allow a tenant to have an assistance animal as a reasonable accommodation.
HUD is committed to offering individuals with disabilities accessible, integrated housing options that enable them to make meaningful choices about housing, health care, and long-term services and supports so they can participate fully in community life.

05/05/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-080.cfm,"HUD Secretary Fudge, HHS Secretary Becerra Announce Joint Effort to Increase Access to COVID-19 Vaccinations","WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Marcia L. Fudge and U.S. Health and Human Service (HHS) Secretary Xavier Becerra today announced a joint-agency effort to increase access to COVID-19 prevention and treatment services, including testing and vaccinations, among disproportionately affected communities, including among HUD-assisted households and people experiencing homelessness. This effort will leverage the Health Center COVID-19 Vaccine Program, which currently provides a direct supply of vaccines to nearly 800 health centers across the country. HUD and HHS expect the effort will reach over 6,000 multifamily housing properties, 6,700 homeless shelters, and approximately 7,500 public housing properties across the country to respond to and stop the spread of COVID-19.
Secretaries Fudge and Becerra unveiled the joint agreement during a visit to Community of Hope. Located in Ward 8 of Washington, D.C., Community of Hope is a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) supported by HHS' Health Resources and Services Administration and a HUD-funded homeless services and housing provider for families with children.
""More than 100 million Americans are now fully vaccinated. Yet there are many others who still need help getting the vaccine. To raise our vaccination numbers even higher, we must continue to center our efforts around the guiding principle of equity,"" said HUD Secretary Fudge. ""Many of the people that HUD serves are among the most vulnerable in our society. They're seniors, they're people with disabilities, they're people of color from households of modest means, and they're people who are experiencing homelessness. This new partnership between HHS and HUD is about saving lives by expanding access to comprehensive COVID care for those in need. It's about meeting people where they are—and about bringing health care home.""
""Innovating and reaching people where they are is a critical part of advancing President Biden's vision to create a healthier America,"" said HHS Secretary Becerra. ""HHS and HUD have committed to working collaboratively to leverage available resources to increase access to the full scope of COVID-19 prevention and treatment services - such as tests and vaccines - among families and individuals living in public housing. I'm thrilled to work hand-in-hand with my partner Secretary Fudge as we work towards a more accessible and equitable health care system.""
As part of the Biden-Harris Administration's commitment to an equitable response to COVID-19, this joint HUD-HHS effort recognizes that bringing vaccinations to all Americans means adding highly-targeted efforts focused on vulnerable communities alongside mass vaccination efforts for the general public.
""We encourage all community health centers to establish or further expand existing partnerships with local HUD grantees and program participants, including single- and multi-family housing owners and managers, public housing authorities, Continuums of Care, and homeless providers,"" Secretaries Fudge and Becerra wrote in their letter. ""These partnerships should engage at the local level as part of a comprehensive strategy to prevent, mitigate, and respond to COVID-19, including through testing, treatment, and vaccination. This includes accessible, culturally responsive outreach on vaccine safety and efficacy to increase vaccine confidence.""
In their letter, the Secretaries direct community health centers, HUD grantees, and others to facilitate broader access to COVID-19 vaccines and testing. The letter lays out several steps they can take to achieve this, including assisting with registering and scheduling COVID-19 tests and vaccination appointments and facilitating on-site vaccine clinics at HUD-assisted or insured properties, public housing developments, homeless shelters, and through mobile facilities serving people experiencing unsheltered homelessness.
During their visit to Community of Hope, Secretaries Fudge and Becerra participated in a roundtable with President and CEO Kelly Sweeney McShane, staff, and clients, and toured the facility to learn about the organization's work to improve outcomes for low-income, homeless, and underserved families in Washington, DC.

The sale, which was finalized on Thursday, included 70 mortgage notes for single family homes located in cities and towns throughout the State of New York that are vacant or abandoned, and with mortgages that were 90 or more days delinquent. The sale agreement includes provisions that the notes should be held and resolved in ways that promote affordable housing, reduce neighborhood blight, and align with HUD's mission to strengthen neighborhoods.
""This week's direct sale is a much welcomed outcome for everyone involved, and most importantly, the communities where these vacant properties are located,"" said Lopa Kolluri, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for HUD's Office of Housing. ""Through this transaction, 70 properties throughout the State can once again be vibrant community assets and affordable homes for families.""
The transaction was completed with NJCC-NYS Community Restoration Fund II LLC (CRF), a limited liability company comprised of the State of New York Mortgage Agency and New Jersey Community Capital, a non-profit entity. CRF will be able to leverage its public-private partnership in a way that resolves the delinquent mortgages and revitalizes the vacant and abandoned mortgaged properties.

About Direct Note Sales HUD's Asset Sales Division conducts direct sales of mortgage notes with states or other local government entities. Most government entities choose to work with non-profit affordable housing organizations. A direct sale of defaulted mortgage notes on vacant and abandoned properties allows HUD and the purchaser to work together to source notes on properties in specific geographic areas or other criteria that match the affordable housing and community revitalization goals of the entity. For HUD, a note sale improves returns to the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund over returns realized by a real-estate owned sale. HUD's Asset Sales Division is part of the Office of Finance and Budget in HUD's Office of Housing."
05/07/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-082.cfm,HUD Charges Kansas Homeowners Association with Disability Discrimination,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is charging The Apollo Gardens Homes Association, Inc. (HOA), Inc, in Mission, Kansas, and its board president with violating the Fair Housing Act for allegedly refusing to allow a resident with a mobility impairment to expand her own sidewalk at her own expense. The requested modification would have enabled the resident to use her walker and have more stability. HUD's charge also alleges that, rather than granting the requested accommodation from HOA restrictions, the HOA retaliated against the resident by removing her from a position on the HOA board and denying her reinstatement request. Read HUD's charge.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to refuse to permit residents to make reasonable modifications to their existing premises when such modifications may be necessary to afford a person with disabilities full enjoyment of a dwelling. The Act also prohibits housing providers from retaliating against persons with disabilities who request to make such modifications.
""A homeowner association may not deny a resident with disabilities permission to make a reasonable modification they need,"" said Jeanine Worden, HUD's Acting Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue taking necessary action to ensure that individuals and entities that control access to housing abide by the requirements of the Fair Housing Act.""
""Individuals with disabilities have the right to make reasonable modifications to their own housing to fully enjoy their residence and should never face retaliation for asserting their fair housing rights,"" said Damon Smith, HUD's Principal Deputy General Counsel. ""HUD is committed to making sure housing is equally accessible to residents with disabilities and that their requests to make modifications are handled appropriately.""
HUD's charge alleges that Apollo Gardens HOA required association members who sought a modification or accommodation due to a disability to follow the same process as members who sought to remodel a residence for aesthetic reasons. HUD's charge further alleges that when the homeowner with disabilities provided information to the association explaining that the sidewalk expansion would have ""made a big difference in [her] ability to use [her] front sidewalk,"" the association voted against allowing the modification and voted to remove the homeowner from its board.
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party elects for the case to be heard in federal court. If, after a hearing, the administrative law judge finds that discrimination has occurred, the judge may award damages to the complainant for her losses that have resulted from the discrimination.

05/11/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-083.cfm,HUD Awards $51 Million to Clean Up Lead Hazards in Public Housing,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today awarded nearly $51.4 million to 25 Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) in 19 states to identify and reduce lead-based paint hazards in thousands of older public housing units. Provided through HUD's Public Housing Capital Fund, these grants will be targeted to public housing units currently occupied by families with young children. See funding chart below.
""In order to be healthy, it's important to have a healthy home,"" said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""Protecting families with young children from lead and other health hazards is an important part of HUD's mission, and we don't take it lightly. It is also a matter of environmental justice, and HUD is committed to President Biden's directive to prioritize environmental justice and equity for disadvantaged communities.""
Although lead-based paint was banned for residential use in 1978, HUD estimates that about 24 million older homes still have significant lead-based paint hazards today. While most public housing has already undergone abatement, there are still some properties where lead-based paint remains, and where hazards have redeveloped. Lead-contaminated dust is the primary cause of lead exposure and can lead to a variety of health problems in young children, including reduced IQ, learning disabilities, developmental delays, reduced height, and impaired hearing. At higher levels, lead can damage a child's kidneys and central nervous system and can even be deadly.
On January 27, 2021, President Biden issued (www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/01/27/fact-sheet-president-biden-takes-executive-actions-to-tackle-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad-create-jobs-and-restore-scientific-integrity-across-federal-government) an Executive Order that placed environmental justice at the forefront of efforts to tackle the climate crisis. HUD's awarding of this $51 million in funding is in line with the President's order, as lead poisoning disproportionately affects people of color.
Today's funding is the third round of funding under this program. To date, HUD has awarded $46.1 million to 51 grantees, to make approximately 4,610 units lead safe. HUD has a long history of working to ensure lead-safe housing, which fits into the broader federal response to address lead hazards found in paint, dust and soil, and other sources like water and consumer goods. For 25 years, HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes has worked to improve methods to identify and address home-related health and safety hazards, including those from lead. Since 1993, HUD has awarded more than $1.58 billion in grants to communities for identification and control of lead-based paint hazards in over 190,000 low-income privately owned housing units. In addition, HUD supports research on best practices for identifying and controlling lead-based paint hazards, and conducts an outreach program to raise public awareness and knowledge about lead poisoning.
HUD is awarding capital funding to the following local public housing authorities to identify and clean up lead hazards in their properties:"

""The safety and health of HUD-assisted families is one of our highest priorities,"" said Dominique Blom, General Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Office of Public and Indian Housing (PIH). ""The decision for HUD to take possession of a public housing authority is exercised with great restraint out of respect for local leadership, and only when the law permits. We will work closely with the community, local leaders, and the residents to reach a positive outcome.""
Citing a decade of neglect, a high number of unit vacancies, poor physical condition of units and properties, un-auditable financials and records, HUD will help HPHC get on the right path and improve the quality of life for the residents.
On April 29, HUD informed HPHC of its intention to take possession of its programs, projects, and assets. Upon possession on Monday, May 10, a HUD Recovery Administrator began serving as the Board and will make decisions necessary to ensure decent and safe housing for residents by implementing the following:
Take over fiduciary responsibilities, establishing internal controls, procurement actions and repositioning strategies. Work with the existing third-party management agent, Continental Management, to perform day-to-day operations for its public housing program. Assess options to reposition HPHC's public housing.
• Take over fiduciary responsibilities, establishing internal controls, procurement actions and repositioning strategies.
• Work with the existing third-party management agent, Continental Management, to perform day-to-day operations for its public housing program.
• Assess options to reposition HPHC's public housing.
The completion of the Recovery Agreement/Recovery Action Plan will serve as the platform for improved service delivery to residents towards the ultimate goal of ensuring decent and safe housing for HPHC families."
05/12/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-085.cfm,HUD Charges Indiana Housing Providers with Disability Discrimination for Refusing to Permit Applicant to Have an Assistance Animal,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is charging Bloomington, Indiana's Burnham Rentals, LLC, Burnham Place Apartments, LLC, two of its employees and others, with violating the Fair Housing Act's bar on disability discrimination. HUD's charge alleges that the housing providers refused to permit a rising Indiana University graduate student, who has depression and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, to keep an assistance animal in an apartment. In addition, HUD's charge alleges that the housing providers used the building's ""no pets"" policy as justification to deny the student's request to live with her assistance animal, effectively denying her access to the housing. Read HUD's charge.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from denying or limiting housing to people with disabilities, or from refusing to make reasonable accommodations in policies or practices when necessary to provide persons with disabilities an equal opportunity to use or enjoy a dwelling. This includes refusing to rent to people with disabilities who have assistance animals that perform work or tasks, or that provide disability-related emotional support. ""Not allowing someone with mental health disabilities to keep an assistance animal robs them of their independence as well as the opportunity to fully enjoy their home,"" said Jeanine Worden, HUD's Acting Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD remains committed to ensuring that the owners of rental housing meet their obligations under the nation's fair housing laws.""
""Often people with mental health disabilities who request reasonable accommodations face discrimination because their disabilities are not visible. HUD works to ensure that the rights of individuals with 'invisible' disabilities are fully visible and enforced,"" said Damon Smith, HUD's Principal Deputy General Counsel.
HUD's charge alleges that the graduate student used the assistance animal, a cat, to ameliorate her symptoms in lieu of medication that caused her side effects. With her doctor's support and monitoring, she found relief with the assistance animal. The housing providers, however, allegedly denied her request to keep the animal, resulting in the student being forced to rent another, more expensive, apartment farther from the university.
This month, HUD is commemorating Mental Health Awareness Month 2021 with the launch of a new campaign that will educate the public about the various forms of housing discrimination faced by people with mental health, intellectual, or developmental disabilities, and what they should do if they believe their housing rights have been violated. To access the campaign's educational materials, visit FHEO's Outreach Tools page.
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party elects for the case to be heard in federal court.

05/14/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-086.cfm,HUD Reaches Agreement to Resolve Disability Discrimination Complaint and Deliver Affordable Accessible Housing in Puerto Rico,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has reached a Voluntary Compliance Agreement (VCA) with the Rio Plata Housing Development and the Puerto Rico Housing Finance Authority (PRHFA), resolving allegations of disability discrimination and ensuring accessibility in federally-funded housing developments across Puerto Rico. The VCA leverages a federal $2.5 million PRHFA-awarded Housing Trust Fund grant to bring the Rio Plata Housing Development into compliance with federal accessibility requirements. The Agreement also requires Rio Plata to pay $100,000 in relief to resolve the discrimination complaint that was filed with HUD. Rio Plata provides 90 units of affordable housing for income-qualifying families. Read the Voluntary Compliance Agreement (English Language Version) (Spanish Language Version).
The VCA stems from allegations of discrimination and inaccessible housing against Rio Plata that left a resident without the use of a bedroom or bathroom in her home since approximately 2014 because of her mobility disability. Additionally, the Agreement builds upon commitments made to HUD by PRFHA in 2017 to remove accessibility barriers from affordable housing developments across its portfolio and bring properties into compliance with federal accessibility standards. The PRHFA administers funding to over 18,000 affordable housing units at approximately 160 developments in Puerto Rico through HUD's Section 8 Project Based Rental Assistance program.
""HUD is committed to overcoming and redressing this Nation's history of housing discrimination and we will deliver on this promise for the residents of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico,"" said Jeanine Worden, Acting Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Those who accept HUD funds to provide affordable housing make a commitment to not discriminate and that means delivering housing that is accessible for persons with disabilities and their families. We will ensure these commitments are kept.""
HUD will continue to support the development of affordable housing in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and announced that an additional $3.2 million in Housing Trust Fund dollars was committed on April 20, 2021 to further this effort. The Department, through this Agreement, will provide support and oversight to Puerto Rico in its administration of these and other federal funds to ensure low-income, individuals with disabilities in Puerto Rico can access affordable housing.
HUD enforces the Fair Housing Act, which prohibits discrimination because of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, and disability. HUD also enforces other federal fair housing laws, including Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, that prohibit discrimination against persons with disabilities by requiring accessibility in programs, activities, services, and facilities receiving federal funds.

Fudge today announced the allocation of $5 billion in American Rescue Plan funds for emergency housing vouchers for individuals and families who are experiencing homelessness or at risk of homelessness. Secretary Fudge made the announcement during a Zoom call with Congressman David Price (NC), Senator Patty Murray (WA), Dallas, TX Mayor Eric Johnson, and Oakland, CA Mayor Libby Schaaf.
The supplemental funding is allocated through the Emergency Housing Voucher (EHV) program. Through EHV, HUD is providing 70,000 housing choice vouchers to local public housing authorities (PHAs) across the country to help Americans find and remain in housing. Click here for a full list of initial allocations.
""While most of us spent more time in our homes than we ever have, more than half a million Americans had to spend the last year either in crowded shelters or sleeping outside,"" said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""With HUD's swift allocation of this $5 billion in American Rescue Plan funding, we are providing communities the resources to give homes to the people who have had to endure the COVID-19 pandemic without one. Congress now needs to pass the President's American Jobs Plan. This once-in-a-generation investment would bring the United States closer to ending homelessness and housing instability.""
""Stable housing is a basic human need, and the foundation upon which people build their lives. Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, 1,296 Emergency Housing Vouchers are available for unhoused individuals and those facing housing instability in the state of North Carolina,"" said Congressman David Price. ""As Chairman of the Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development Appropriations Subcommittee, I am proud to work alongside HUD to carry out the vital mission of ending homelessness through a Housing First approach to help build our country back better.""
""The American Rescue Plan is working, bringing more than $400 million in rental assistance to Washington state and hundreds of millions more in homeowner and homelessness assistance - including the emergency housing vouchers we're talking about today,"" said Senator Patty Murray. ""The legislation we sent to President Biden's desk is making an important difference in people's lives, especially for people of color who have felt the disproportionate impact of this crisis. We're making real progress to get our communities back to 'normal' — but that isn't good enough when 'normal' wasn't working for so many before the pandemic. We faced a housing crisis before the pandemic, and we need to keep working to pass the American Jobs Plan — to help our country build back stronger and fairer than before.""
""The best way to address homelessness is to prevent it. And the American Rescue Plan Act emergency vouchers that the Biden Administration is allocating today will provide a major boost to our efforts,"" said Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson. ""Through this program alone, more than 1,100 families in our area will receive assistance and will be able to stay in their homes. We are deeply appreciative of the Biden Administration for this much-needed assistance that will make our city stronger.""
""The Biden-Harris Administration gets it — housing is infrastructure,"" said Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf. ""Our homelessness crisis requires a bold, multi-faceted response, and today's announcement that Oakland will receive more than 500 emergency housing vouchers for our most vulnerable residents will have an immediate impact in our community. I'm proud to work with Secretary Fudge and the administration to end the humanitarian crisis of homelessness in our country.""
The $5 billion in EHV-ARP funding gives communities the resources needed to help eligible households find and remain in housing. HUD estimates that these EHVs, alongside resources provided by the CARES Act, could help house 130,000 households.
The $5 billion in EHV-ARP funding is the second of two homelessness-related funding opportunities from the American Rescue Plan that HUD released. In April, HUD announced the allocation of $5 billion in ARP funds to increase affordable housing to address homelessness."

Read the Conciliation Agreement.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from denying housing to persons with disabilities or subjecting them to discriminatory terms or conditions, including denying reasonable accommodation requests.
""Persons with disabilities who request accommodations aren't asking for special treatment. They're asking for what they need to use and enjoy their homes,"" said Jeanine Worden, HUD's Acting Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity.

Heyman Service to America Medals (Sammies). Michelle Daniels, Charles D. Eldridge, Ryan E. Jones and the Foster Youth to Independence Team, created an innovative program offering housing assistance and social services to young people aging out of foster care to prevent them from becoming homeless and to provide an opportunity for self-sufficiency.
Daniels, Eldridge, Jones, and the Foster Youth to Independence Team are finalists in the ""Management Excellence Category,"" which recognizes a federal employee or team for a significant accomplishment that exemplifies efficient, effective, and results-oriented government. The Sammies is one of the most prestigious recognitions for federal service, commonly referred to as the ""Oscars"" of government service. Winners will be announced in fall 2021.
""We are excited to have HUD employees recognized for such a prestigious award, highlighting their tremendous work during such a challenging and extraordinary moment in our country's history,"" said Dominque Blom, HUD General Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing. ""Having affordable housing options for everyone, particularly our youth who are aging out of foster care, is essential and helps put them on the path to success. We wish Team HUD good luck and thank the Partnership for recognizing the achievements of our Foster Youth to Independence Program.""
""This program is so unique in that it was designed by foster youth themselves working with HUD staff to create an on-demand housing subsidy for youth aging out of foster care,"" said Danielle Bastarache, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public Housing and Voucher Programs. ""The FYI program provides foster youth with housing security that is so critical for self-sufficiency and success in life.""
""For each of the unprecedented challenges we have faced in the last year, dedicated public servants have worked behind the scenes to move our country forward, heal our nation and strengthen our democracy,"" said Max Stier, president and CEO of the Partnership for Public Service. ""The 2021 Service to America Medals finalists have shown tremendous commitment to the public good, and they, like all public servants, deserve our support and recognition.""

In particular, respondents allegedly failed to provide language access services to Vietnamese residents and retaliated against a Cascade Village employee for advocating for residents with limited English proficiency to receive oral interpretation services and translated vital documents. Read the agreement.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from discriminating against persons based on their national origin. This includes aiding others in the exercise or enjoyment of their fair housing rights. Additionally, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of national origin by recipients of federal financial assistance, and requires such recipients to take reasonable steps to ensure meaningful access for limited English proficient (LEP) persons.
""Everyone who applies for or lives in HUD-assisted housing should be able to access critical information about that housing, such as the application process, the terms of their lease, and the apartment building's rules,"" said HUD's Acting Assistant Secretary Jeanine Worden. ""Language must not be a barrier to accessing affordable housing. Under fair housing laws, affordable housing providers have an obligation to make important information available to all applicants and tenants, including people whose primary language is not English.""
The case came to HUD's attention when an agent at Cascade Village Apartments, which receives HUD funding, filed a complaint alleging that the owners and managers of the property failed to provide language access services to the complex's Vietnamese residents and retaliated against an employee because she advocated for the housing providers to provide language services to LEP residents.
Under the terms of the settlement, FPI Management, Inc., agrees to, among other things, pay $10,000 to the employee who filed the complaint. FPI Management will also provide $20,075 in compensation to residents of the property, with each household receiving $275 as either a check or as a rent credit. In addition, a notification letter will be sent to each household in their primary language notifying them of the agreement, including that FPI Management will provide LEP applicants with free oral interpretation services and translated documents when required by law.

Competitive funding is available to up to 50 communities for implementation of youth specific innovative programs to address the needs of youth experiencing or at risk of homelessness. Read HUD's Notice of Opportunity (www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=333749).
""Getting and keeping young people off the streets and helping them find a safe, stable home can change the trajectory of their lives,"" said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""Local leaders who are on the ground every day know what it takes to meet the needs of youth experiencing homelessness, and this funding will empower them to do so. I am pleased to announce this funding and encourage local groups to apply.""
""While eradicating youth homelessness is a tough challenge, we can work toward the goal of getting it done with the help of our local partners,"" said Arthur Jemison, HUD Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary. ""Offering this funding to local communities through our Youth Homelessness Demonstration Program not only helps vulnerable youth but it also brings us closer to ending youth homelessness as we know it.""
The Youth Homelessness Demonstration Program was developed with youth in mind, relying upon the recommendations provided directly from young people who had experienced homelessness. To ensure that the program meets the needs of young people, HUD has continued to work closely with young people with lived experience in the application review process and to provide technical assistance to communities to help them incorporate youth voices and leadership into their local work. HUD works closely with our Federal partners, including the Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Department of Education, and the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, program development and application assessment to ensure that YHDP communities are working with a diverse set of stakeholders and across silos to assist youth in crisis.
Selected communities will use funding for rapid re-housing, permanent supportive housing, and transitional housing, and to fund innovative programs, such as host homes. YHDP will also support youth-focused performance measurement and coordinated entry systems. To date, HUD has funded almost 300 projects in 44 communities across the country through the Youth Homelessness Demonstration Program. HUD is excited to work with the next cohort of YHDP communities and the great work that they will do to address youth homelessness."

EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take three months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, six months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2 percent) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percentage change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percentage changes are 90 percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percentage changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised 3 percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau's website (www.census.gov/construction/nrs/how_the_data_are_collected/index.html)."

Fudge on Wednesday announced that five communities have received a combined $160 million to redevelop severely distressed housing and spur comprehensive revitalization under the federal Choice Neighborhoods Initiative.
HUD has named Camden, New Jersey; Cleveland, Ohio; Detroit, Michigan; Fort Myers, Florida; and Lewiston, Maine as this year's grant winners.
""Since its creation, the Choice Neighborhoods initiative has transformed communities across the nation,"" said Secretary Fudge. ""Today's announcement will support local vision for reinvigorating low-income communities into areas of opportunity-whether it be with regard to housing, health, education, childcare, or jobs. I applaud each of the five communities for their commitment to ensuring affordable housing serves as a platform for community innovation and individual advancement.""
The Choice Neighborhoods initiative supports the revitalization of communities through an emphasis on linking housing improvements with comprehensive social services and physical neighborhood improvements. Local leaders, residents, and stakeholders, such as public housing authorities, cities, schools, police, business owners, nonprofits, and private developers, come together to create and implement a plan that revitalizes distressed HUD-assisted housing and addresses the challenges in the surrounding neighborhood. This year's awardees were selected from a pool of 20 applications.
Choice Neighborhoods is focused on three core goals:
• Housing: Replace distressed public and assisted housing with high-quality mixed-income housing that is well-managed and responsive to the needs of the surrounding neighborhood;
• People: Improve outcomes of households living in the target housing related to employment and income, health, and children's education; and
• Neighborhood: Create the conditions necessary for public and private reinvestment in distressed neighborhoods to offer the kinds of amenities and assets, including safety, good schools, and commercial activity, that are important to families' choices about their community.
The five awardees will create nearly 2,700 new mixed-income housing units as part of their efforts to revitalize their neighborhoods. Based on information provided in each community's application, for every $1 in Choice Neighborhoods funding, the awardees will leverage an additional $10.60 in public and private resources for their project proposals.

Fudge today toured Kansas City, Missouri to highlight how President Biden's American Jobs Plan will address the affordable housing crisis and revitalize our nation's housing infrastructure. Secretary Fudge was joined on the visit by Congressman Emanuel Cleaver (MO-05) and Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas.
""Our homes can serve as a bridge to greater opportunities and a better life,"" said Secretary Fudge. ""The American Job Plan is a historic, once-in-a-generation investment in our nation's infrastructure-including our housing infrastructure. If we want the United States to remain the greatest nation in the world, then we must first take care of home-in the most literal sense. To pass an infrastructure plan that fails to expand affordable housing and to revitalize our communities would be akin to building a road that leads to nowhere.""
During the visit, Secretary Fudge toured 18th and Vine Jazz District, where she delivered remarks about the importance of housing as infrastructure. She also visited the Mattie Rhodes Center, a community development organization working on the development of affordable, sustainable local housing. There, she participated in a roundtable on job creation through housing construction.
Ahead of Secretary Fudge's visit, HUD released a fact sheet on how the American Rescue Plan provides HUD resources to strengthen communities, expand access to affordable housing, and create jobs.

Fudge today was elected chair of the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH).
U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Secretary Denis McDonough was elected as the Council's vice chair.
""I'm honored to have been elected by my fellow members as the Council's first chair during the Biden-Harris Administration,"" said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""We are at a pivotal moment for USICH - and for the homelessness crisis in our country. As chair, I am committed to leveraging the Council to tackle homelessness through a Housing First approach and meaningful interagency collaboration.""
The Council, which consists of representatives from 19 federal agencies, elects new leadership from its members on an annual basis. Each agency is allotted one vote. Secretaries Fudge and McDonough were unanimously elected by all agencies present. The chair and vice chair lead Council meetings, increase public and congressional attention to homelessness, support implementation of the federal strategic plan, and foster collaboration between federal member agencies.
The United States was facing a homelessness crisis even before the COVID-19 pandemic. The Department of Housing and Urban Development's 2020 Annual Homeless Assessment Report (AHAR) to Congress (www.huduser.gov/portal/sites/default/files/pdf/2020-AHAR-Part-1.pdf) found that on a single night in January 2020, 580,466 people experienced homelessness in the United States, an increase of 12,751 people, or 2.2 percent, from 2019. After steady reductions from 2010 to 2016, homelessness has increased in the last four consecutive years.
Addressing the nation's homelessness crisis has been a top priority for Secretary Fudge and the Biden-Harris Administration. Secretary Fudge recently announced the allocation of $10 billion in American Rescue Plan homelessness assistance: $5 billion in funding through the HOME Investment Partnerships Program to increase affordable housing to address homelessness, and $5 billion for 70,000 emergency housing vouchers."

But our plans include more than just brick and mortar; we intend to offer advancement opportunities consistent with those of our other housing communities, where we offer robust scholarship programs and professional development programs. And needless to say, we can't wait to get started.""
""Since the early 2000s, when developers wanted to build a marina and a golf course here, the residents of Ablett Village have lived in fear of being displaced,"" said Tracey Powell, President of the Ablett Village Residents Council. ""This is our home. This is where we want to be. But up until now, we were never 100 percent sure that we couldn't lose our homes. But thanks to this grant, we will finally have the housing security that we so desperately crave.""

During NHHM, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes (OLHCHH) partners with organizations across the county to educate residents through outreach, workshops, and local campaigns.
National Healthy Homes Month serves to educate families and communities about the importance of creating and maintaining a healthy home by addressing home-based hazards including reducing moisture and mold, improving ventilation, controlling pests, and maintaining indoor air quality.
This year's theme, ""The Power of Partnerships,"" exemplifies the success of HUD's history in fostering partnerships to address childhood lead safety and create healthy homes nationwide. These partners include housing and community development departments and agencies; academic institutions; home repair businesses; hospitals and medical clinics; health care and housing finance agencies; faith and community-based organizations; weatherization or energy efficiency corporations; and advocacy entities. Our collective work is the reason we have achieved great progress in mitigating the impacts of unhealthy housing, strengthening communities, preserving affordable housing, and ensuring future generations can achieve their full potential.
""Working with our local partners is vital to addressing housing related health and safety hazards, whether it's in big cities or in rural and other settings,"" said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""During the pandemic, when outreach was challenging as many people sheltered at home, our partners and many others continued to implement our programs to help residents maintain safe and healthy homes.""
During the month, outreach includes the broad dissemination of a digital toolkit and a series of national, stakeholder-targeted webinars throughout June. These webinars are designed to help educators and other stakeholders to stay abreast of healthy homes research, guidelines, and emerging issues.

06/10/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-098.cfm,HUD Restores Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing Requirement,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Marcia L. Fudge announced that HUD published (www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/06/10/2021-12114/restoring-affirmatively-furthering-fair-housing-definitions-and-certifications) an interim final rule on Thursday to restore the implementation of the Fair Housing Act's Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing (AFFH) requirement. The publication provides a robust definition of the duty to affirmatively further fair housing, to which many HUD grantees must certify compliance. Additionally, HUD is committed to providing communities that receive HUD funding with the technical support they need to meet their long-standing fair housing obligations.
In addition to barring housing discrimination, the Fair Housing Act requires HUD and its funding recipients, such as local communities, to also take affirmative steps to remedy fair housing issues such as racially segregated neighborhoods, lack of housing choice, and unequal access to housing-related opportunities. To fulfill this requirement, in 2015, HUD promulgated a rule that compelled each covered funding recipient to undertake a defined fair housing planning process. Funding recipients were required to complete an assessment of fair housing issues, identify fair housing priorities and goals, and then commit to meaningful actions to meet those goals and remedy identified issues, with HUD reviewing each assessment. The last administration suspended implementation of this rule and eliminated the 2015 rule's procedural requirements, redefining the regulatory AFFH requirement so it was no longer consistent with the actual requirements of the Fair Housing Act.
Under the restored AFFH regulatory definition announced today, municipalities and other HUD funding recipients that must regularly certify compliance with the Fair Housing Act's AFFH requirement will, in doing so, commit to taking steps to remedy their unique fair housing issues. To support compliance with AFFH, HUD will provide a voluntary process that funding recipients can choose to use to identify the fair housing concerns that exist locally and commit to specific steps to remedy them. HUD will provide technical assistance and support to funding recipients that carry out this voluntary fair housing planning process.
""More than 50 years since the Fair Housing Act's passage, inequities in our communities remain that block families from moving into neighborhoods with greater opportunities,"" said Secretary Fudge. ""As a former mayor and Member of Congress, I know firsthand the importance of giving localities the tools they need to ensure their communities have access to safe, affordable housing near quality schools, transportation, and jobs. Today, HUD is taking a critical step to affirm that a child's future should never be limited by the ZIP code where they are born.""
This rule is one of the ways in which HUD fulfills its legal mandate under the Fair Housing Act to ""affirmatively further"" the purposes of the Act. Additionally, it is consistent with President Biden's January 26 Memorandum, Redressing Our Nation's and the Federal Government's History of Discriminatory Housing Practices and Policies, which directed HUD to examine the prior Administration's fair housing rules and take all steps necessary to implement the Fair Housing Act's requirement that HUD administer its programs in a manner that affirmatively furthers fair housing. With today's action, HUD rescinds the previous Administration's rule (entitled ""Preserving Neighborhood and Community Choice,"" or PCNC) and restores certain definitions and other selected parts from the 2015 AFFH rule.
The interim final rule will go into effect on July 31, 2021. HUD will take comments for 30 days after publication and may act on them prior to the effective date of the rule.
HUD intends to undertake a separate rulemaking to build upon and further improve the 2015 AFFH rule by instituting a new fair housing planning process and framework that increases efficiency and improves outcomes for communities across the country."

""With COVID-19 still a threat and with the sweltering summer months just around the corner, the $1.1 billion we are announcing today comes at a critical time in our efforts to get people experiencing homelessness off the streets and into safe, stable homes. Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, communities now have the robust resources they need to make significant progress toward ending homelessness.""
Today's awarding of $1.1 billion in EHVs is part of $5 billion that the American Rescue Plan Act enabled HUD to allocate in additional vouchers to PHAs. HUD allocated these vouchers to communities with the greatest need for EHVs and where local housing authorities demonstrated capacity to administer this vital assistance. The EHV program serves geographically diverse housing needs, from high-cost urban areas to a large number of rural communities. HUD notified PHAs on May 10, 2021 of their EHV eligibilities and projected funding as authorized by the American Rescue Plan. The awards announced today are based on the PHAs' acceptance of the EHVs.
EHV funding gives communities significant resources to assist individuals and families who are homeless; at risk of homelessness; fleeing, or attempting to flee, domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, stalking, or human trafficking; or recently homeless. EHVs help individuals and families find housing and remain stably housed long-term.
The $1.1 billion in EHVs will cover the cost of vouchers and related administrative costs, including up-front costs needed to stand up the program, for an initial 18-month period. Thereafter, HUD will provide annual funding to cover the cost of renewals in 12-month increments through September 30, 2030 or until the $5 billion ARP allocation runs out, whichever comes first.
HUD has allocated $10 billion in American Rescue Plan homelessness assistance: In addition to the $5 billion for EHVs, HUD allocated $5 billion through the HOME Investment Partnerships Program to increase affordable housing to address homelessness."

HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge issued the oath of office to Deputy Secretary Todman during a ceremony at HUD's headquarters that was livestreamed to the department's staff. Deputy Secretary Todman was confirmed by the Senate by unanimous consent on June 10.
Deputy Secretary Todman most recently served as the CEO of the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials (NAHRO). Before joining NAHRO in 2017, she served as the Executive Director of the District of Columbia Housing Authority (DCHA) and served in several career positions at HUD. Click here for a full bio.
Below find video remarks delivered by Deputy Secretary Todman.
Video remarks as delivered:
I still remember the first trip I made to our nation's capital when I was a teenager. I felt inspired by the potential of the American government to help improve the lives of people in every corner of our country. I returned home to the U.S. Virgin Islands determined to devote my life to public service.
Since that trip, I have spent my career working to expand opportunity for people -in the halls of Congress, at federal and local housing agencies, and as an advocate for organizations that advance affordable housing and community development.
Throughout my journey, I have made it my mission to help restore and revitalize our nation's public housing; to help build more affordable homes in our country; to help house people who are homeless and to help families achieve their dreams.
At every step along the way, I have worked to safeguard the public's trust-and to deliver support to people in need with efficiency and with equity.
My name is Adrianne Todman-and I now have the great honor of serving as the Deputy Secretary of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development.
This will mark my second time serving at HUD-and I am thrilled to rejoin our amazing team and work alongside Secretary Fudge to build a stronger, more secure, and more inclusive America.
Today, I am filled with the same sense of excitement, inspiration, and hope that I experienced during my first trip to Washington. And I can't wait to start working on behalf of the people and communities that HUD serves!"
06/16/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-101.cfm,HUD Charges New York Landlord with Disability Discrimination,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is charging a landlord in Niagara Falls, New York, with violating the Fair Housing Act by denying a tenant's reasonable accommodation request to keep an assistance animal and retaliating against the tenant by evicting her. Read HUD's charge.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from discriminating against individuals with disabilities, including refusing to make reasonable accommodations in policies or practices when such accommodations may be necessary to provide such individuals an equal opportunity to use or enjoy a dwelling. This includes permitting persons with disabilities to have service or assistance animals. It also means that a housing provider that has a ""no-pets"" policy must waive it for a resident or prospective resident who needs an assistance animal because of a disability.
""Assistance animals provide invaluable support for persons with disabilities, including allowing them to fully utilize and enjoy the place they call home,"" said Jeanine Worden, HUD's Acting Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Today's action sends a loud and clear message to housing providers that HUD remains committed to ensuring that they meet their obligation to comply with the nation's fair housing laws.""
""The Fair Housing Act requires housing providers to make reasonable accommodations so individuals with disabilities who need assistance animals can have them. And housing providers may not retaliate against people who seek reasonable accommodations to which they are entitled,"" said Sasha Samberg-Champion Deputy General Counsel for Enforcement & Fair Housing. ""As this charge demonstrates, HUD will take action when housing providers violate these tenants' rights.""
HUD's charge alleges that the owner of a Niagara Falls apartment complex refused to allow a woman with mental health disabilities to keep an assistance animal even though she provided him with a physician's letter attesting to her need for the accommodation. The charge alleges further that the owner refused to allow the woman to live with the animal and subsequently evicted her, claiming that the dog had displayed aggressive behavior and was not a legitimate assistance animal.
Last month HUD commemorated Mental Health Awareness Month 2021 with the launch of a campaign to educate the public about the various forms of housing discrimination people with mental health, intellectual, or developmental disabilities often face, and what they should do if they believe their fair housing rights have been violated.
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge. If, after a hearing, the administrative law judge finds that discrimination has occurred, the judge may award damages to the complainant for her losses that have resulted from the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties in order to vindicate the public interest.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 877-8339 (Relay). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to hud.gov/fairhousing."

06/18/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-103.cfm,Federal Housing Administration Takes Steps to Remove Barriers to Homeownership for Those with Student Loan Debt,"
WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) on Friday announced updates to its student loan monthly payment calculations to take steps to remove barriers and provide more access to affordable single family FHA-insured mortgage financing for creditworthy individuals with student loan debt, which has a disproportionate impact on people of color. The updated policy more closely aligns FHA student loan debt calculation policies with other housing agencies, helping to streamline and simplify originations for borrowers with student loan debt obligations.
""As our country comes together to remember Juneteenth and acknowledge National Homeownership Month, we are reminded of a basic truth: that, too often in our history, the march toward freedom has been a long, halting, and uneven journey,"" said Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""Homeownership is the cornerstone of the American Dream and the best way to build generational wealth. I am proud that FHA is taking action to make it easier for borrowers with student loan debt to qualify for a federally insured mortgage. This new policy will make a big difference for individuals throughout our nation and is another step in our mandate to promote equity and opportunity for homeownership.""
The policy updates published on Thursday evening for FHA Single Family Title II forward mortgages remove the current requirement that lenders calculate a borrower's student loan monthly payment of one percent of the outstanding student loan balance for student loans that are not fully amortizing or are not in repayment. The new policy bases the monthly payment on the actual student loan payment, which is often lower, and helps home buyers who, with student debt, meet minimum eligibility requirements for an FHA-insured mortgage.
This announcement enhances FHA's ability to serve one of its core demographics—first-time homebuyers. Over 80 percent of FHA-insured mortgages are for first-time homebuyers on average each year. FHA estimates that more than 45 percent of these borrowers also have student loan debt, with much of this debt impacting people of color.
""These changes remove unnecessary constraints for otherwise creditworthy borrowers and reinforce FHA's ability to serve those who need us most, including first-time homebuyers and underserved communities,"" said Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Federal Housing Administration Lopa Kolluri.
""Today as we prepare to celebrate Juneteenth and recognize June as Homeownership Awareness Month, it is critical that we reflect on all of the ways that racial discrimination is woven into our society, especially in our housing system. Too many generations of Black families are locked out of the opportunity to get an affordable mortgage, own their own home, and build wealth to pass on to their children and grandchildren,"" said U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown, Chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. ""I commend HUD and Secretary Fudge for taking this first step to address inequities in our housing system and look forward to continuing to work together to increase access to homeownership and address disparities.""
Lenders may implement the changes immediately but must implement the changes for FHA Case Numbers assigned on or after August 16, 2021."
06/21/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-104.cfm,HUD Takes Additional Steps to Free Up Long-Awaited Disaster Recovery Funds for Puerto Rico and USVI,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today published a Federal Register notice governing the use of $2 billion in Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) funds for electric power system enhancements and improvements for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The publication of this notice is the latest in a series of HUD actions under the Biden-Harris Administration to support recovery and renewal in Puerto Rico and the USVI.
""Today's announcement is an important step in addressing the recovery and resilience needs of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands,"" said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""By opening the door to this $2 billion in funding, HUD is enabling Puerto Rico and the USVI to improve the reliability and resilience of their electrical systems to promote environmental equity and to both withstand the impacts of climate change and contribute less to its causes.""
In 2017, Hurricanes Irma and Maria damaged significant elements of the electricity systems in Puerto Rico and the USVI. Following the hurricanes, five months of repairs were required to restore power to the USVI, and approximately eleven months of repairs were needed to restore power to Puerto Rico.
CDBG-DR funds for electrical power system improvements provide a unique and significant opportunity for Puerto Rico and the USVI to carry out strategic and high-impact activities to address necessary expenses and mitigate disaster risks to their electrical power systems; improve system reliability, resiliency, efficiency, and sustainability; and address each system's long-term financial viability.
The Department seeks to maximize the impact of these CDBG-DR funds by encouraging the formation of public-private partnerships, partnerships with local, community, and neighborhood organizations, and through enhanced coordination with other Federal programs.
In the action plan governing the use of these funds, grantees are also required to describe how the funds will be used to address the needs of vulnerable populations, protected classes, and underserved communities; how the funded activities primarily benefit low- and moderate-income persons; and how the planned improvements will be designed and implemented to address the impacts of climate change.
Since its first days, the Biden-Harris Administration has prioritized action to enable stronger recovery for Puerto Rico and the USVI. This includes obligating long-awaited disaster recovery funds and removing onerous restrictions placed on the grants, such as incremental grant obligations, Federal Financial Monitor review, and more. With today's Federal Register notice, ninety percent of promised funds have been obligated to Puerto Rico."
06/23/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-105.cfm,Secretary Fudge Outlines HUD Actions to Address Reentry Housing Needs and Increase Public Safety,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Marcia L. Fudge today outlined actions that the Department is taking to improve public safety by addressing the housing needs of returning citizens, including through the recently awarded 70,000 emergency housing vouchers funded by the American Rescue Plan.
In a letter sent to public housing authorities, Continuums of Care, multifamily owners, and HUD grantees, Secretary Fudge clarified that returning citizens who are at-risk of homelessness are among the eligible populations for these emergency housing vouchers and encouraged public housing authorities and their Continuum of Care partners to ensure that eligible returning citizens are given consideration for these vouchers. Secretary Fudge also discussed additional steps that HUD is taking to improve access to housing for returning citizens and people with criminal records.
Secretary Fudge's letter is tied to the Biden-Harris Administration's new comprehensive strategy (www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/23/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-comprehensive-strategy-to-prevent-and-respond-to-gun-crime-and-ensure-public-safety/) to increase public safety.
""The President and I believe that everyone deserves a second chance and a stable home from which to rebuild their lives. No person should exit a prison or jail only to wind up on the streets,"" wrote Secretary Fudge. ""To that end, HUD is committed to taking a comprehensive approach to addressing the housing needs of returning citizens and people with criminal records, and by doing so, increasing public safety within our communities. Addressing reentry housing needs also furthers the Biden Administration's commitment to advancing equity and reversing systemic racism, given the racial disparities evident in the criminal justice system.""
The full text of the letter is below. A pdf copy is available here.
June 23, 2021
Dear Public Housing Authorities, Continuums of Care, Multifamily Owners, and HUD Grantees,
Among my priorities at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is to ensure the public safety of the households, the properties, and the communities that we assist. One of the most important ways that HUD can meet this priority is to ensure that people leaving prisons and jails are supported in their reentry to the community. Research also shows that people who lack stable housing following incarceration face a higher likelihood of rearrest and reincarceration. On the other hand, a stable home can serve as the foundation upon which returning citizens can rebuild their lives, obtain employment, improve their health, and achieve recovery.
Unfortunately, too many people exit prisons and jails in America without a stable home to return to. A significant number of people experiencing homelessness are caught in a revolving door between homelessness and reincarceration. In some communities, the lack of stable housing can also delay a person's approval for discretionary release from prison, leading people to serve more time behind bars than those with stable housing. Many people face housing denials based on their criminal records years or decades after serving their time, even when their criminal history does not indicate that they present a substantial risk to persons or property.
The President and I believe that everyone deserves a second chance and a stable home from which to rebuild their lives. No person should exit a prison or jail only to wind up on the streets.
To that end, HUD is committed to taking a comprehensive approach to addressing the housing needs of returning citizens and people with criminal records, and by doing so, increasing public safety within our communities. Addressing reentry housing needs also furthers the Biden Administration's commitment to advancing equity and reversing systemic racism, given the racial disparities evident in the criminal justice system.
The American Rescue Plan provides us with a near-term opportunity to assist people exiting prisons or jails, namely through the nearly 70,000 emergency housing vouchers recently awarded to more than 600 public housing authorities (PHAs) across the country. HUD Notice PIH 2021-15 makes clear that people exiting prisons and jails who are at-risk of homelessness due to their low incomes and lack of sufficient resources or social supports are eligible for these vouchers. Given the significant overlap between recent incarceration history and homelessness, HUD strongly encourages PHAs to work with their Continuum of Care (CoC) partners to ensure that individuals who are at-risk of homelessness after leaving prisons or jails are considered for these vouchers. In the coming weeks, HUD will provide further tools to help communities assess the homelessness risk of people exiting prisons and jails and to create and strengthen referral partnerships between PHAs, CoCs, and corrections agencies for these vouchers.
In addition to leveraging this opportunity through the American Rescue Plan, HUD is taking additional steps to meet the housing needs of returning citizens and to reduce barriers to housing among people with criminal records. This includes:
Developing additional tools and guidance to assist private landlords, PHAs, and Multifamily housing owners to ensure that their applicant screening and tenant selection practices avoid unnecessarily overbroad denial of housing to applicants on the basis of criminal records that could lead to Fair Housing violations, consistent with the 2016 memo on disparate impact and criminal records; Reviewing existing HUD policies and regulations that limit access to housing and HUD assistance among people with criminal conviction histories; and Publishing findings regarding best and promising practices on reentry housing, including through HUD's existing programs and demonstrations like the Juvenile Reentry Assistance Program and the Pay for Success Permanent Supportive Housing Demonstration (www.hudexchange.info/programs/pay-for-success/).
• Developing additional tools and guidance to assist private landlords, PHAs, and Multifamily housing owners to ensure that their applicant screening and tenant selection practices avoid unnecessarily overbroad denial of housing to applicants on the basis of criminal records that could lead to Fair Housing violations, consistent with the 2016 memo on disparate impact and criminal records;
• Reviewing existing HUD policies and regulations that limit access to housing and HUD assistance among people with criminal conviction histories; and
• Publishing findings regarding best and promising practices on reentry housing, including through HUD's existing programs and demonstrations like the Juvenile Reentry Assistance Program and the Pay for Success Permanent Supportive Housing Demonstration (www.hudexchange.info/programs/pay-for-success/).
As we take these and other steps to meet the housing needs of returning citizens, I will continue to work closely with the many organizations and entities that help to administer HUD's programs at the state and local level. By working together, I am confident that we can make significant progress in meeting the housing needs of returning citizens, increase their chances of success, and increase public safety within our communities. I thank you for your partnership in these and other efforts.
Sincerely,
Marcia L. Fudge"

EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take three months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, six months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2 percent) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percentage change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percentage changes are 90 percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percentage changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised 3 percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau's website (www.census.gov/construction/nrs/how_the_data_are_collected/index.html)."
06/25/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-107.cfm,HUD Proposes Restoring Discriminatory Effects Rule,"
WASHINGTON - U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Marcia L. Fudge announced on Thursday that HUD will publish in the Federal Register a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) entitled Restoring HUD's Discriminatory Effects Standard. The publication proposes to rescind the Department's 2020 disparate impact rule and restore the 2013 discriminatory effects rule. In its NPRM, HUD states that it believes the 2013 rule is more consistent with decades of caselaw and better effectuates the Act's broad remedial purpose of eradicating unnecessary discriminatory practices from the housing market.
""We must acknowledge that discrimination in housing continues today and that individuals, including people of color and those with disabilities, continue to be denied equal access to rental housing and homeownership,"" said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""It is a new day at HUD-and our Department is working to lift barriers to housing and promote diverse, inclusive communities across the country. Today's publication of the proposed discriminatory effects rule is the latest step HUD is taking to fulfill its duty to ensure more fair and equitable housing.""
The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in housing and housing-related services because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, familial status, and disability. The discriminatory effects (also referred to as disparate impact) doctrine is a tool for addressing policies that cause systemic inequality in housing. It has long been used to challenge policies that unnecessarily exclude people from housing opportunities, including zoning requirements, lending and property insurance policies, and criminal records policies. Accordingly, having a workable discriminatory effects standard is vital for the accomplishment of the Biden-Harris Administration's policy goal of a housing market that is free from both intentional discrimination and policies and practices that have unjustified discriminatory effects.
HUD's 2013 discriminatory effects rule codified long-standing caselaw for adjudication of Fair Housing Act cases under the discriminatory effects doctrine, for cases filed administratively with HUD and for federal court actions brought by private plaintiffs. Under the 2013 rule, the discriminatory effects framework was straightforward: a policy that had a discriminatory effect on a protected class was unlawful if it did not serve a substantial, legitimate, nondiscriminatory interest or if a less discriminatory alternative could also serve that interest. The 2020 rule complicated that analysis by adding new pleading requirements, new proof requirements, and new defenses, all of which made it harder to establish that a policy violates the Fair Housing Act. HUD now proposes to return to the 2013 rule's straightforward analysis.
The public will have 60 days to file comments on the NPRM. HUD will review the comments, develop responses, and publish a final rule. In the meantime, HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (FHEO) continues to vigorously enforce the Fair Housing Act, including addressing policies and practices by housing providers, lenders, insurers, appraisers, and others that cause unjustified systemic inequities based on race or other protected class."
06/25/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-108.cfm,Federal Housing Administration Introduces More Measures to Help Homeowners Struggling Due to COVID-19,"
WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) on Friday announced more measures to help homeowners with FHA-insured mortgages who are struggling financially due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These measures will provide additional, immediate relief while also expanding outreach and home retention options for struggling homeowners who are disproportionately people of color.
""Since President Biden took office, COVID-19 cases and deaths are down by nearly 90 percent, and the economy is rebounding strongly,"" said Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""Importantly, we must continue to take action to ensure that those who may have experienced hardships brought on by COVID-19 have the support they need to remain in their homes. I am pleased that FHA is implementing additional measures to meet this unprecedented challenge and ensure a fair and equitable recovery.""
""These measures are important steps we need to take to ensure that the individuals and families that continue to struggle financially due to COVID-19 have access to effective and meaningful recovery options,"" said Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Federal Housing Administration Lopa Kolluri. ""We will continue to assess additional solutions to help homeowners in distress keep their homes and avoid future foreclosure where possible.""
Extended Single Family Foreclosure and Eviction Moratoria
In conjunction with the Biden-Harris Administration and other federal agencies (www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/24/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-initiatives-to-promote-housing-stability-by-supporting-vulnerable-tenants-and-preventing-foreclosures/), FHA is extending its foreclosure and eviction moratoria for all FHA-insured single family mortgages, except vacant or abandoned properties, through July 31, 2021. This automatic extension is a one-month additional safeguard for those who are struggling to remain in their homes as the nation transitions from relief to recovery.
Further, FHA is continuing its extension of the deadline for first legal action and reasonable diligence timeframes for 180 days after July 31, 2021, to provide servicers with the additional time needed to focus their work on assisting distressed homeowners. This extension excludes vacant or abandoned properties.
Extended COVID-19 Forbearance Request Timeframes
To assist homeowners who remain at risk of falling behind on their mortgage payments due to COVID-19, FHA is extending the time period for homeowners to start new forbearance plans to September 30, 2021. Homeowners who have not previously been in COVID-19 forbearance can request this pause or reduction in mortgage payments. The COVID-19 Forbearance for homeowners who newly request forbearance assistance between July 1, 2021, and September 30, 2021, is for six months.
For homeowners who received a forbearance from their mortgage servicer between July 1, 2020, and September 30, 2020, FHA is providing one additional three-month forbearance extension for those who need and request additional time to recover financially before resuming mortgage payments.
COVID-19 Advance Loan Modification
FHA is also introducing a new home retention option, the COVID-19 Advance Loan Modification (COVID-19 ALM). The COVID-19 ALM will offer significant payment relief to eligible homeowners.
The COVID-19 ALM will be offered to borrowers currently 90 or more days delinquent or at the end of their COVID-19 Forbearance. This new home retention option is for those homeowners whom a 30-year rate and term mortgage modification will bring the mortgage current and will reduce the Principal and Interest portion of their monthly mortgage payment by at least 25 percent.
Mortgage servicers must review their FHA servicing portfolio and offer the new COVID-19 ALM to distressed homeowners with FHA-insured mortgages who have faced a COVID-19 related hardship. To accept the modification, borrowers need to only sign and return the mortgage modification documents to their mortgage servicer.
All loss mitigation options will remain available to borrowers that do not accept the COVID-19 ALM for any reason. Borrowers who cannot make the modified mortgage payments with the COVID-19 ALM or who have other questions should reach out to their mortgage servicer to learn about other options that are available to them.
Home Equity Conversion Mortgage COVID-19 Extensions
To assist seniors with Home Equity Conversion (reverse) Mortgages (HECMs) who have been negatively affected by COVID-19, FHA is extending the ability for these homeowners to request an extension before the servicer may request the loan be called due and payable. For extension requests received between July 1, 2021, and September 30, 2021, servicers must grant homeowners an extension of up to six months.
For HECM homeowners with loans that have already been called due and payable, servicers must approve homeowner requests for an extension for any deadline related to foreclosure and claim submission of up to six months when the request is received between July 1, 2021, and September 30, 2021.
For all HECMs that received an extension between July 1, 2020, and September 30, 2020, FHA is providing one additional three-month extension period if needed, when the homeowner requests this extension from their mortgage servicer.
Homeowners Seeking Assistance
FHA urges those who are behind on their mortgage payments or are having difficulty complying with the terms of their HECM, and have not yet contacted their mortgage servicer, to do so immediately. By contacting their servicer, homeowners can obtain a mortgage payment forbearance or a HECM extension. FHA also urges homeowners to engage with their mortgage servicer when their mortgage servicer contacts them about the new COVID-19 ALM or other loss mitigation home retention options.
Homeowners who are seeking more information on the options available to them should also consider contacting a HUD-approved housing counseling agency.
HUD is committed to removing barriers to homeownership for communities of color, persons with disabilities, and those with limited English proficiency. This includes removing long-standing barriers to obtaining fair housing. These communities have been disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and HUD will continue to work to:
Ensure that lenders and others in the real estate industry do not engage in practices that have an unjustified discriminatory effect on communities of color and other protected classes. Ensure that forbearance programs are actively and affirmatively marketed to those in the housing market area least likely to be aware of the options, least likely to apply, and to those that face barriers. Eliminate or reduce barriers for requesting forbearance. Ensure that lenders are aware of how anti-discrimination laws apply to communication with limited English proficient (LEP) households. As of HUD’s 2016 Limited English proficiency guidance, over twenty-five million persons in the United States - approximately nine percent of the population - have limited English proficiency. Ensure lenders understand their obligation to make reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities, including changes or exceptions to policies, practices, procedures, and services that may be necessary to provide equal opportunities and equal access for individuals with disabilities. Recognize that homeowners facing default may be vulnerable to foreclosure rescue scams that often target limited English proficient communities, and other communities of color. Ensure lenders are not discriminating in the maintenance and marketing of foreclosed properties. Lenders may not engage in substandard maintenance and marketing of foreclosed properties in communities of color, particularly while properly maintaining and marketing foreclosed properties in predominantly white communities.
• Ensure that lenders and others in the real estate industry do not engage in practices that have an unjustified discriminatory effect on communities of color and other protected classes.
• Ensure that forbearance programs are actively and affirmatively marketed to those in the housing market area least likely to be aware of the options, least likely to apply, and to those that face barriers.
• Eliminate or reduce barriers for requesting forbearance.
• Ensure that lenders are aware of how anti-discrimination laws apply to communication with limited English proficient (LEP) households. As of HUD’s 2016 Limited English proficiency guidance, over twenty-five million persons in the United States - approximately nine percent of the population - have limited English proficiency.
• Ensure lenders understand their obligation to make reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities, including changes or exceptions to policies, practices, procedures, and services that may be necessary to provide equal opportunities and equal access for individuals with disabilities.
• Recognize that homeowners facing default may be vulnerable to foreclosure rescue scams that often target limited English proficient communities, and other communities of color.
• Ensure lenders are not discriminating in the maintenance and marketing of foreclosed properties. Lenders may not engage in substandard maintenance and marketing of foreclosed properties in communities of color, particularly while properly maintaining and marketing foreclosed properties in predominantly white communities."
06/28/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-109.cfm,HUD Approves Agreement Between Massachusetts Housing Provider and Prospective Tenant with Child Settling Claims of Discrimination,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has approved a Conciliation Agreement between the owner of rental properties in Springfield, MA, and a prospective tenant, resolving allegations that the owner refused to rent available units to the woman after learning that she has a child under the age of six. Read the agreement.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to discriminate against families with children under the age of eighteen. Housing providers may exclude children only if the housing meets the Fair Housing Act's exemption for housing for older persons.
""Families looking for safe, decent housing shouldn't be penalized because they have children,"" said Jeanine Worden, HUD's Acting Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity."" Today's agreement reaffirms HUD's commitment to working to ensure that housing providers meet their obligation under the Fair Housing Act to treat all home seekers equally, including those who have children.""
The case came to HUD's attention when a woman who has a child filed a complaint with HUD alleging that the owner of rental units she sought to lease refused to rent to her because her child is under the age of six. Massachusetts law requires landlords to de-lead any unit in which a child under six lives.
Under the terms of the agreement, the owner will: pay the woman $15,000, undergo fair housing training, include language in all future rental advertisements indicating that he complies with all federal and state fair housing laws, and test and de-lead his properties as necessary.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 877-8339 (Relay). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to hud.gov/fairhousing."
06/29/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/nhm_fact_sheet.cfm,"National Homeownership Month FACT SHEET: Secretary Fudge Prioritizes Access to Homeownership, Sustainability for Existing Homeowners and Narrowing the Racial Wealth Gap","June marks National Homeownership Month, a time to highlight efforts to help families achieve affordable and sustainable homeownership. HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge has made it a central priority to help families realize the dream of homeownership.
A home is more than four walls and a roof. It is our bedrock-a place that serves as a bridge to greater opportunity and a better life. A home can connect us to better jobs, more affordable transportation options, and communities with cleaner air and cleaner water. It is a place that can help build wealth that can be passed down to generations to come.
The dream of homeownership-and the security and wealth creation that comes with it-is out of reach for too many Americans. This is especially true in the wake of the economic devastation brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic and the shortage of available affordable housing inventory.
We know that families of color have been systemically locked out of buying homes and continue to face discrimination in our housing market when trying to secure mortgages, having their homes appraised, and living in neighborhoods where their families can thrive. In recent years, the homeownership gap between Black and white families reached its widest point since 1968, before the Fair Housing Act became law.
Many communities remain profoundly segregated by race, with opportunities far greater in white neighborhoods than in communities of color. Households of color have also been disproportionately impacted by the economic downturn the pandemic caused, having higher unemployment rates, incidents of sickness and death, and falling behind on household expenses like rent and mortgage payments.
HUD is committed to supporting sustainable and affordable homeownership opportunities to help more low- and moderate-income and first-time homebuyers who want to move from renting to owning. We are vigorously enhancing tools and resources to make affordable FHA-insured mortgage financing more accessible to those who need it most.
Delivering Relief to Homeowners Impacted by COVID-19. On his first day in office, President Biden took executive action to extend foreclosure moratoriums for nearly 11 million households with mortgages guaranteed by the Federal Government. Following the Biden-Harris Administration's introduction and passage of the American Rescue Plan, HUD introduced streamlined options for relief for homeowners and continues to work with the Department of Treasury to implement nearly $10 billion in relief for homeowners who have fallen behind on their mortgage payments during the pandemic. During Homeownership Month, the Federal Housing Administration introduced additional measures to help homeowners during the pandemic, including extending the foreclosure moratorium for all FHA-insured single family mortgages through July 31, extending the initial forbearance request timeframes, providing additional relief to seniors with Home Equity Conversion reverse mortgages, and providing new mortgage payment recovery options for those most in distress.
Removing Barriers to Homeownership for Those with Student Loan Debt. The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) updated its policy on student loan monthly payment calculations to remove barriers and provide more access to affordable single family FHA-insured mortgage financing for creditworthy individuals with student loan debt, which has disproportionate impact on communities of color. The updates removed the previous requirement that lenders calculate a borrower's student loan monthly payment of one percent of the outstanding student loan balance for student loans that are not fully amortizing. The new policy bases the monthly payment on the actual student loan payment, more closely aligning FHA policies with industry standards.
Advancing Fair Housing. The Biden-Harris Administration announced actions to end discrimination in the housing market. More than 50 years since the Fair Housing Act's passage, access to wealth through homeownership remains persistently unequal. In his first week in office, President Biden issued a memorandum directing HUD to address discrimination in our housing market. Secretary Fudge is taking critical steps towards realizing the President's directive. HUD has published both its proposed rule on countering housing practices with discriminatory effects and its interim final rule on the legal duty to Affirmatively Further Fair Housing in the Federal Register. These rules will align federal enforcement practice with the Fair Housing Act's broad remedial purpose to end discrimination in housing. Together, they will provide the legal framework for HUD to require private and public entities alike to rethink established practices that contribute to or perpetuate systemic inequality in housing and recognize and address longstanding fair housing issues in our communities.
Improving Homebuyer Assistance Programs. The President's FY2022 HUD budget proposal makes clear that housing is foundational to building a strong, more secure America. The FY2022 HUD budget includes a $100 million set-aside for Secretary Fudge's new initiative, the FirstHOME Homebuyer Assistance initiative, which provides funding to States and insular areas - unincorporated territories of the United States - to support sustainable homeownership.
Developing New Programs for First-Time Homebuyers. The FY2022 HUD budget also includes funding to pilot new FHA programs intended to lower barriers to homeownership for potential first-time homebuyers. These FHA-insured loans may be paired with assistance from the FirstHOME initiative to increase initial equity for first-time homebuyers and further the aim of sustainable homeownership.
Taking Action to End Racial Bias in the Housing Market. On June 1st in Tulsa, President Biden announced that Secretary Fudge will lead a first-of-its-kind interagency initiative to address inequity in home appraisals. The effort will utilize, quickly, the many levers at the federal government's disposal, including potential enforcement under fair housing laws, regulatory action, and development of standards and guidance in close partnership with industry and state and local governments, to root out discrimination in the appraisal and homebuying process. These are the kinds of policies and practices that keep Black families across the nation from building generational wealth through homeownership. A 2018 Brookings study (www.brookings.edu/research/devaluation-of-assets-in-black-neighborhoods/) found that homes in majority-Black neighborhoods are often valued at tens of thousands of dollars less than comparable homes in similar-but majority-White-communities. And the crisis is worsening: a recent study (www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-21/race-gap-in-home-appraisals-has-doubled-since-1980?sref=A1Z2GUXp) found that the gap between the appraised value of homes in predominantly White neighborhoods compared to comparable homes in predominantly Black and Latino neighborhoods nearly doubled between 1980 and 2015.

07/08/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-110.cfm,"HUD Enters into Consent Order with Carbrook Associates in Brooklyn, New York, Addressing Race and Disability Discrimination","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has reached an agreement with Carbrook Associates, LP (Carbrook), a provider of project-based subsidized housing that plans to exit HUD's Project-Based Rental Assistance (PBRA) program this October. The Consent Order resolves allegations that Carbrook discriminated on the basis of race and disability in the operation of its multifamily housing properties. The Consent Order requires Carbrook to make modifications so units and common areas are accessible to individuals with disabilities. It also requires Carbrook to provide families who are seeking housing an equal opportunity to apply for and live in units regardless of race, color, sex, religion, disability, and other characteristics protected by federal fair housing laws. Specifically, Carbrook must conduct affirmative fair housing marketing and modify its waitlist policies and procedures.
Since 1981, Carbrook has received federal funds to provide affordable housing to income-qualifying families in Brooklyn, New York. In the ten-year period prior to HUD's findings, Carbrook received over $11.5 million in Project-Based Rental Assistance (PBRA) from HUD to operate two affordable multifamily housing developments. Carbrook has elected to end participation in the PBRA program in October. Under these circumstances, to protect assisted residents and preserve affordable housing, federal law ensures that tenant protection vouchers will be available to all residents. Those provide mobile rental assistance that can travel with the family should they choose to leave the property. HUD also has tools to keep the project-based assistance viable at another location even after the opt-out at this property.
""HUD is committed to enforcing federal civil rights laws and will not tolerate housing providers taking federal housing funds while shirking their civil rights obligations and refusing to cooperate with federal civil rights investigations,"" said Jeanine Worden, HUD's Acting Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Today's Consent Order demonstrates HUD's commitment to ensuring individuals with disabilities and persons of color have an equal opportunity to live in affordable, accessible housing.""
HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (FHEO) conducted an investigation of allegations that Carbrook engaged in race and disability discrimination under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504). FHEO's investigation found that Carbrook had failed to eliminate architectural barriers that limited access by individuals with disabilities and failed to cooperate in HUD's investigation of Carbrook's alleged practice of excluding tenants of racial and other minority groups, resulting in occupancy of its buildings by almost exclusively white tenants.
When Carbrook and HUD failed to resolve these allegations, in April 2021, HUD's Office of General Counsel (OGC) filed a fund termination proceeding under Title VI and Section 504 with the Office of Hearings and Appeals. HUD deferred PBRA monthly voucher payments while the legal proceeding was pending due to the unresolved allegations of disability and race discrimination. The parties then were able to achieve a voluntary resolution.
""Fair housing laws prohibit discrimination based on disability and race, and the Department takes compliance with fair housing laws very seriously. We prefer to resolve fair housing matters cooperatively, but will take appropriate legal action to ensure compliance with fair housing laws,"" said Sasha Samberg-Champion, Deputy General Counsel for Enforcement and Fair Housing.
Section 504 prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance, such as PBRA, and requires that recipients of federal financial assistance bring their programs and activities into compliance with federal accessibility requirements. Title VI similarly prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin in any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.
Under the terms of today's Consent Order, Carbrook will:
Ensure that at least 5 percent of its units are fully mobility accessible, and at least 2 percent are designated sensory accessible; Ensure that accessible units are appropriately tenanted; Hire an independent licensed architect to evaluate and design the accessible retrofitting of existing units and common areas; Create a new marketing plan and advertise to community groups least likely to apply across New York City; Ensure advertisements include a written statement that Carbrook does not discriminate on the basis of race color, national origin, disability, familial status, religion, or sex; Purge its existing waitlist, create a new waitlist of families, and alternate housing offers between the two waitlists while it receives PBRA; After it leaves the PBRA program in October 2021, comply with the requirements of the Fair Housing Act; and Report to HUD progress for the next two years on its compliance with the Consent Order.

• After it leaves the PBRA program in October 2021, comply with the requirements of the Fair Housing Act; and

07/08/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-112.cfm,HUD Charges California Mobile Home Park with Housing Discrimination,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has charged San Luis Rey Homes, Inc., a mobile home community in Oceanside, CA, with violating the Fair Housing Act by refusing to grant a resident with mental health disabilities an accommodation to allow her to keep an assistance animal. Read HUD's charge.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from discriminating against individuals with disabilities, including refusing to make reasonable accommodations in policies or practices when such accommodations may be necessary to provide such individuals an equal opportunity to use or enjoy a dwelling. This includes permitting persons with disabilities to have service or assistance animals. It also requires housing providers that have ""no-pets"" policies to waive those for individuals who use assistance animals because of their disability.
""No one who relies on an assistance animal should be denied an accommodation to live with their animal,"" said Jeanine Worden, HUD's Acting Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD remains committed to taking action whenever the owners of housing developments and other providers of housing fail to meet their obligations under the nation's housing laws.""
""A 'no pets' policy does not allow a housing provider to deny people with disabilities the right to needed assistance animals,"" said Sasha Samberg-Champion, Deputy General Counsel for Enforcement and Fair Housing. ""HUD will enforce the Fair Housing Act to ensure that persons with disabilities have the reasonable accommodations they need to use and enjoy their homes.""
HUD's charge alleges that San Luis Rey Homes, Inc., refused to allow a woman with mental health disabilities to have an assistance animal, a cat, in her mobile home. According to the charge, San Luis Rey Homes initially granted the woman a reasonable accommodation from its ""no-pets"" policy but later reneged, telling her that only service dogs were permitted. San Luis Rey Homes also allegedly sought to fine the woman for failure to comply with its policy."

07/21/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-113.cfm,HUD Makes over $19 Million Available to Fight Housing Discrimination,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is making $19.4 million available to help HUD Fair Housing Initiatives Program (FHIP) agencies conduct activities that will address discriminatory housing practices related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The funds, which are provided through the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARP) signed into law by President Biden on March 11, 2021, will allow private fair housing enforcement organizations to respond to fair housing inquires and complaints, conduct fair housing testing, and implement education and outreach activities related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The funds will also be used to address fair housing issues affecting individuals and families experiencing housing instability, including those who may face displacement due to discriminatory evictions and foreclosures.
These ARP funds may be used by fair housing organizations to equitably expand housing enforcement services for underserved populations who need their services the most. Underserved populations include individuals making fair housing complaints who come from low-income backgrounds and persons with disabilities, as well as people of color, including African Americans, Hispanics, and Asian American and Pacific Islanders. Applicants for the funding may also propose new fair housing projects relating to discriminatory practices arising in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic.
""Housing stability will be a critically important part of America's continuing recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic,"" said Jeanine Worden, HUD's Acting Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""The funding we're announcing today will give our fair housing partner organizations the financial resources they need to address various forms of discrimination that may occur as a result of rental and sales practices, as well as changing credit and real estate operations, related to the pandemic.""
This funding opportunity creates three funding levels for FHIP organizations, based on the average of their three previous annual operating budgets. The three funding award levels include:
Level I - up to $75,000 (for organizations with an average annual operating budget of less than $500,000.)
Level II - up to $125,000 (for organizations with an average annual operating budget of between $500,000 and $700,000.)
Level III - up to $350,000 (for organizations with an average annual operating budget of greater than $700,000.)

07/22/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-114.cfm,HUD Awards More than $27 Million to Local HIV/AIDS Housing Programs,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced more than $27 million to assist thousands of low-income persons living with HIV/AIDS and their families over a three-year period. The funding announced today is offered through HUD's Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS Program (HOPWA) (www.hudexchange.info/programs/hopwa/) and will renew HUD's support of 31 local programs. These grants provide a combination of housing assistance and supportive services for this vulnerable population.
""Safe and stable housing can have a profound impact on one's life,"" said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""HUD is proud to continue its support of local partners in their work to assist persons living with HIV/AIDS in securing the essential housing, healthcare, and opportunities they deserve.""
Research shows that a stable home is critical to the well-being of persons living with HIV/AIDS, and results in better health outcomes and reduced transmission of the disease. In addition to housing assistance, these local programs will provide access to supportive services such as case management, mental health services, substance abuse services, and employment training. The combination of housing assistance and supportive services are critical in sustaining housing stability, promoting better health outcomes, and increasing quality of life, which promotes self-sufficiency efforts for those able to transition to the private housing market.
Since 1992, HUD's HOPWA Program has provided national leadership and resources that support the development and operation of high-quality supportive housing programs. Under the HOPWA Program, HUD makes grants to cities, states, and nonprofit organizations to provide housing assistance and supportive services to low-income persons living with HIV/AIDS and their families. By providing assistance with housing and related services, the HOPWA program helps persons living with HIV/AIDS enter into housing, access and remain in medical care, and adhere to complex treatment regimens.

07/23/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-115.cfm,Federal Housing Administration Announces Additional COVID-19 Recovery Options for Homeowners,"WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) on July 23, 2021 announced streamlined COVID-19 Recovery options to help homeowners with FHA-insured mortgages who have been financially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic bring their mortgage current and remain in their homes. The simplified COVID-19 Recovery waterfall allows mortgage servicers to offer eligible homeowners who cannot resume making their mortgage payments a reduction in the principal and interest portion of their monthly payments. The changes announced today will provide those most in danger of losing their homes a path to deep and sustained recovery, including lower income individuals, families of color, and young, first-time homeowners who have disproportionately suffered economic hardships due to the pandemic.
For homeowners who can resume making their existing monthly mortgage payments, FHA has established a revised COVID-19 Recovery Standalone Partial Claim.
Additionally, FHA is reinforcing today that President Biden's American Rescue Plan Homeowner Assistance Funds (HAF), administered to the States by the Department of Treasury, may be used in connection with FHA-insured mortgages or subordinate mortgages as permitted by the jurisdiction's HAF program and other requirements.
""Immediately upon taking office, President Biden prioritized the nation's public health and economic crises by passing the American Rescue Plan,"" said Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""As Americans get back to work and our economy continues to recover, we are taking targeted steps to make sure homeowners impacted financially by COVID-19 have the support they need to remain in their homes. Housing affordability is at its worst and losing your home now would devastate households. These options for FHA borrowers will ensure equitable relief and recovery to people who need it most.""
New COVID-19 Recovery Waterfall
The new FHA COVID-19 Recovery waterfall streamlines and revises FHA's previous options for struggling homeowners, reduces required documentation, and allows mortgage servicers to provide greater payment reduction for eligible homeowners with FHA-insured Single Family Title II forward mortgages. The simple two-step waterfall options intended for properties that are occupied as the homeowner's primary residence are:
• COVID-19 Recovery Standalone Partial Claim: for homeowners who can resume making their current mortgage payments, the COVID-19 Recovery Standalone Partial Claim allows mortgage payment arrearages to be placed in a zero interest subordinate lien against the property that is repaid when the mortgage terminates, usually when the homeowner refinances or sells the home.
• COVID-19 Recovery Modification: for homeowners who cannot resume making their current monthly mortgage payments, the COVID-19 Recovery Modification extends the term of the mortgage to 360 months at a fixed rate and targets reducing the borrower's monthly principal and interest portion of their monthly mortgage payment. The COVID-19 Recovery Modification must include a Partial Claim if the homeowner has Partial Claim funds available.
For properties that are not occupied by the owner, mortgage servicers must offer eligible homeowners FHA's COVID-19 Recovery Non-Occupant Loan Modification, which extends the term of the mortgage to 360 months, or less if requested by the homeowner, at a fixed interest rate.
""This next step in the evolution of FHA's COVID-19 response is a significant and meaningful way to help those homeowners who will be at a critical point in their recovery in the coming months and transitioning out of forbearance to permanent sustainable payments,"" said Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for FHA and the Office of Housing Lopa Kolluri. ""We can help more homeowners who, through no fault of their own, continue to feel the financially impacts of the pandemic and are unable to make their previous mortgage payment amount. Deeper payment reduction is greatly needed for many of these homeowners to stay in their homes.
COVID-19 Recovery Waterfall Implementation and Homeowner Assessments
Servicers may begin offering the new COVID-19 Recovery waterfall as soon as operationally feasible but must begin using the new waterfall for eligible homeowners within 90 days. In addition, servicers must re-review homeowners for the new COVID-19 Recovery options in circumstances where an existing home retention option has not been completed, where the homeowner was previously ineligible for a COVID-19 home retention option, or if the homeowner has re-defaulted after a COVID-19 home retention option.
""FHA and mortgage servicers have a shared goal of helping as many homeowners as possible to return to sustainable homeownership, and the FHA team will continue to monitor closely the performance of our loss mitigation options to ensure that our policies successfully meet the needs of homeowners impacted by COVID-19,"" said FHA Deputy Assistant Secretary for Single Family Housing Julienne Joseph.
The COVID-19 Advance Loan Modification
The changes announced today work in tandem with the pre-waterfall FHA COVID-19 Advance Loan Modification (COVID-19 ALM) announced on June 25, 2021. The COVID-19 ALM requires mortgage servicers to review their FHA mortgage servicing portfolio and offer the COVID-19 ALM to eligible homeowners. Homeowners who choose to accept the COVID-19 ALM need to only review and sign and return the mortgage modification documents sent to them by their mortgage servicer.
Important Information for Homeowners
FHA urges those who are behind on their mortgage payments or are having difficulty complying with the terms of their reverse mortgage or Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM), and have not yet contacted their mortgage servicer, to do so immediately. By contacting their servicer, homeowners can obtain a mortgage payment forbearance or a HECM extension. For FHA forward mortgages, FHA also urges homeowners to engage with their mortgage servicer when their mortgage servicer contacts them about the new COVID-19 ALM or how to bring their mortgage current. Homeowners who are seeking more information on the options available to them should also consider contacting a HUD-approved housing counseling agency."

EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take three months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, six months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2 percent) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percentage change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percentage changes are 90 percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percentage changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised 3 percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau's website (www.census.gov/construction/nrs/how_the_data_are_collected/index.html)."
07/30/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-117.cfm,HUD Reaches Agreement with California City Settling Claims of Housing Discrimination Against Farmworkers,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has reached a Voluntary Compliance/Conciliation Agreement (VCA) with the City of Santa Maria, California, resolving allegations that the city's enactment and enforcement of restrictions on housing for certain farmworker visa-holders in residential areas of the city violated the Fair Housing Act, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and Section 109 of the Housing and Community Development Act. Read the agreement.
Pursuant to the VCA, the city agreed to immediately halt enforcement of the ordinance that created the restrictions, repeal the ordinance within 90 days, and refrain from enacting any similar restrictions. The ordinance imposed a discretionary conditional use permit requirement on housing for employees, which was directed at housing for H-2A foreign national farmworker visa-holders. The city also agreed to review fines imposed under the ordinance for potential refunds and hire an Employee Housing Resource Officer to receive and address complaints regarding discrimination and the quality and safety of occupied employee housing units going forward. Finally, the city agreed to undertake an effort to analyze and identify any other existing zoning laws that may be discriminatory, in violation of the Fair Housing Act and Title VI.
""Excluding residents from neighborhoods because of their race, color, or national origin violates fair housing laws,"" said Jeanine Worden, HUD's Acting Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""There is a long history of segregation and exclusion of agricultural workers in this country, and it is time it stopped. The Fair Housing Act is clear - jurisdictions may not zone people out of neighborhoods or towns based on their race, color, or national origin.""
The Department opened a compliance review regarding the restrictions under Title VI and Section 109 of the Housing and Community Development Act in April 2020. The Department filed a Secretary-Initiated Complaint on August 26, 2020, alleging violations of the Fair Housing Act. The text and legislative history of the ordinance at issue make clear that the restrictions were directed solely at housing for certain farmworker visa-holders, over 90 percent of whom are from Mexico.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 877-8339 (Relay). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to hud.gov/fairhousing."
07/30/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-118.cfm,Federal Housing Administration Extends Single Family Eviction Moratorium,"WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) on July 30, 2021, announced an extension of its moratorium on evictions for foreclosed borrowers and their occupants through September 30, 2021, and noted the expiration of the foreclosure moratorium on July 31, 2021. This extension is part of President Biden's announcement on July 29 (www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/29/statement-by-white-house-press-secretary-jen-psaki-on-biden-harris-administration-eviction-prevention-efforts/) that federal agencies will use their authority to extend their respective eviction moratoria through the end of September, which will provide continued protection for households living in federally-insured, single-family properties. FHA's eviction moratorium extension will avoid displacement of foreclosed borrowers and other occupants who need more time to access suitable housing options after foreclosure.
""We must continue to do everything within our authority to make sure that foreclosed borrowers who are impacted by the pandemic have the time and resources to secure safe and stable housing, whether it's in their current homes, or by obtaining alternative housing options,"" said Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Housing Lopa P. Kolluri. ""We don't want to see any individuals or families displaced unnecessarily while trying to recover from the pandemic.""
With today's announcement, mortgage servicers must continue to halt evictions for FHA Single Family Title II forward and Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) foreclosed properties, except for those properties that are legally vacant or abandoned.
Mortgage servicers may initiate or continue foreclosures in accordance with FHA requirements once the Single Family foreclosure moratorium expires as planned on July 31, 2021, but may not evict a foreclosed borrower or other occupant.
Important Information for Borrowers Facing Foreclosure
FHA urges those who are behind on their mortgage payments or are having difficulty complying with the terms of their reverse mortgage or Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM), and have not yet contacted their mortgage servicer, to do so immediately. By contacting their servicer, borrowers can obtain a mortgage payment forbearance or a HECM extension. For FHA forward mortgages, FHA also urges borrowers to engage with their mortgage servicer when their mortgage servicer contacts them about the new COVID-19 Advance Loan Modification or how to bring their mortgage current. Borrowers who are seeking more information on the options available to them should also consider contacting a HUD-approved housing counseling agency."
08/06/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-119.cfm,HUD Awards $30 Million to Help Low-Income Elderly Homeowners Age in Place,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today awarded $30 million to 32 nonprofit organizations, state and local governments, and public housing authorities to assist in undertaking comprehensive programs that make safety and functional home modifications and limited repairs to meet the needs of low-income elderly homeowners that allow them to age in place.
Provided through HUD's Older Adults Home Modification Program (OAHMP), these grants allow low-income seniors to stay in their homes through low-cost home modifications that will reduce older adults' risk of falling. Examples of these home modifications include installation of grab bars, railings, and lever-handled doorknobs and faucets, as well as the installation of adaptive equipment, such as non-slip strips for tub/shower or stairs.
These investments will enable older adults to remain in their homes – to ""age in place"" - rather than move to nursing homes or other assisted care facilities.
Experienced nonprofit organizations, state and local governments, and public housing authorities that received funding will deliver home modification services to more than 5,000 qualified beneficiaries and serve communities with substantial rural populations.
""Today, we are renewing our commitment to improving the lives of older adults,"" said HUD Secretary, Marcia L. Fudge. ""The funding provided today will enable low-income elderly persons to remain in their homes and will reduce their risk of falling, improve their general safety, increase accessibility, and improve their functional abilities in their home.""
""There is a strong connection between health and housing,"" said Matthew Ammon, Director of HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes. ""These grants provide a critical resource to communities to make low-cost, low barrier, high impact home modifications tailored to the needs of the residents.""

The following is a state-by-state breakdown of the funding announced today:
*The number of units is an estimate, and subject to availability of funds. Please note that the maximum amount awarded under the FY2021 OAHMP NOFA is $1,000,000 awardees may have received less than their federal request and may adjust the proposed number of units during the first 60 days of the award's period of performance."
08/10/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-120.cfm,"HUD Deputy Secretary Todman, Officials Discuss $5.5 Million in Federal Disaster Recovery and Resilience Funds for Midland, Michigan","WASHINGTON - U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Deputy Secretary Adrianne Todman today held a Zoom call to discuss the nearly $5.5 million in new federal disaster relief awarded by HUD to Midland, Michigan to assist in the city's recovery from severe storms and floods in May 2020. The new Community Development Block Grant Declared Disaster Recovery Fund (DDR) money will help Midland communities rebuild and become more resilient to future disasters.
Deputy Secretary Todman was joined on the call by Midland, Michigan Mayor Maureen Donker, Midland City Manager Brad Kaye, and Michigan State Housing Development Authority Acting Executive Director Gary Heidel.
""Communities can thrive in the face of climate change when they invest in a resilient recovery,"" said Deputy Secretary Todman. ""That is why I am pleased that HUD is awarding $5.5 million in new federal funding to assist the Midland community in their recovery from the severe storms and floods of May 2020. With this funding, Midland will have the resources it needs to improve the community's climate resilience and the lives of those most impacted by the flooding, particularly low- and moderate-income families and individuals.""
""The City of Midland is extremely grateful to HUD for this generous support,"" said City of Midland Mayor Maureen Donker. ""Midland has seen significant tragedy and triumph in recent years, with devastating flooding events in 2017 and, more recently, the Edenville and Sanford dam failures in 2020. These events impacted the lives of residents, derailed businesses, and even affected our municipal operations. We've listened to the community to identify unmet needs, and, with these funds, we will improve infrastructure, address post-flood housing challenges, and become more sustainable and responsive to these events as we continue to grow and change as a community. Thank you for this support which helps Midland continue its legacy of being a place where everyone thrives.""
""After speaking with several residents in Midland who were impacted by the flood, I know this help will bring a sense of healing and offering to the community,"" said Midland Housing Commission Commissioner Erin Patrice. ""Many felt helpless and hopeless after the devastating loss that they encountered. I believe this can bring much help and some hope back to many.""
""This grant will allow some of the hardest hit Midland families and businesses to rebuild from the catastrophic flooding last year and provides an opportunity for the City to build more resilient infrastructure,"" said Midland Housing Commission Commissioner Haseeb Moten. ""Thank you to HUD and the City employees that have worked hard to make this possible.""
""The County of Midland is very excited about the grant being awarded to the City of Midland,"" said County of Midland Administrator/Controller Bridgette Gransden. ""The residents of the City as well as other areas of the county, were devastated by the historic flood and dam failures of 2020. We welcome any mitigation funding available.""
""We will work tirelessly to get communities hit hard by natural disasters the help they need to recover and rebuild,"" said Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer. ""I am grateful that our federal partners at the Department of Housing and Urban Development are sending $5.5 million to help Michiganders in Midland rebuild from May 2020's severe storms and floods. We have a lot of work to do to make lasting investments in our infrastructure to make it more resilient. I know that we can come together to put Michiganders first and get it done.""
Midland experienced historic flooding as a result of rainfall from May 17 to May 19, 2020. The rain caused the Edenville and Sanford Dams to fail, resulting in widespread flooding that destroyed homes and forced thousands of residents to evacuate. On July 9, 2020, FEMA issued a major disaster declaration for Arenac, Gladwin, Iosco, Midland, and Saginaw Counties. Midland still faces unmet needs: HUD's analysis of FEMA registrant data shows more than 800 homes in Midland that received damage due to the dam failure, with more than 500 of the homes having serious unmet needs such has housing repair and rehabilitation.
The $5,476,035 in DDR funds announced today will assist Midland in addressing emergency community development needs resulting from this disaster. The city can use the funding to facilitate natural infrastructure to reduce future flooding, reconstruct infrastructure with resilient and green features, and retrofit low- and moderate-income homes to repair damage while increasing energy efficiency and resilience.
DDR funds are made available in accordance with Section 106(c)(4) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, which allows the HUD Secretary to use CDBG funds that have been recaptured pursuant to CDBG program sanctions for the purpose of addressing recovery efforts from major disasters. It also indicates that HUD shall make these funds available to metropolitan cities and urban counties located or partially located in areas affected by major disasters declared pursuant to the Stafford Act, and shall give priority to providing emergency assistance. HUD may also provide assistance to a metro city or urban county if they have been covered by a major declared disaster for which the declaration occurred in the past three years."
08/12/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-121.cfm,HUD and FHFA Announce Collaboration to Advance Fair Housing and Fair Lending Enforcement,"WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) (collectively, the Agencies) entered into a first-of-its-kind collaborative agreement regarding fair housing and fair lending coordination. Under the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), the two Agencies will focus on enhancing their enforcement of the Fair Housing Act, which HUD is primarily charged with administering and enforcing, and their oversight of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac (the Enterprises), and the Federal Home Loan Banks (collectively, the regulated entities), all of which FHFA regulates.
The MOU is an important mechanism that strengthens the Agencies' ability to enforce fair housing and fair lending requirements, by promoting information sharing, coordination on investigations, compliance reviews, and the ongoing monitoring of the Enterprises. The Agencies anticipate that the MOU will lead to stronger oversight that will help advance vigorous fair housing enforcement that can begin to redress our nation's history of discriminatory housing practices.
""Today's signing is an important and historic step to advance and strengthen the enforcement of our nation's fair housing and fair lending requirements,"" said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""FHFA oversees entities that have significant control over a large share of the mortgage market. Stepping up our collective fair housing oversight of their activities will make an enormous impact on lives and communities. I am proud to partner with Acting Director Thompson on this effort and advance the work that President Biden called upon us to do. We are prioritizing the work required to remove barriers that have created separate and unequal neighborhoods and limited access to housing opportunity and wealth building. I look forward to working with FHFA to make a meaningful impact in this space.""
""FHFA does not tolerate housing discrimination,"" said FHFA Acting Director Sandra L. Thompson. ""Today's MOU allows FHFA and HUD to share information and resources to improve fair lending oversight over the mortgage finance system. I am pleased to work with Secretary Fudge on the important work of fulfilling the Fair Housing Act's promise of equal access to safe, decent, and affordable housing for all Americans."""

He also held several roles at HUD during the Obama-Biden Administration, including Senior Counsel and Acting General Counsel."
08/18/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-124.cfm,HUD Announces $2.7 Billion Funding Opportunity to Help People Experiencing Homelessness,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is making $2.656 billion in FY 2021 Continuum of Care Program (CoC) competitive funding available to homeless services organizations across the country for supportive services and housing programs for people experiencing homelessness. Read HUD's Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) (www.grants.gov/web/grants/search-grants.html?keywords=hud%20coc%20nofo).
""The safety of a stable home is essential during the COVID-19 pandemic and this Administration is committed to meeting the needs of the more than half a million Americans who are struggling with homelessness on any given day,"" said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""Coupled with the historic resources in the American Rescue Plan, the Continuum of Care Program grants made available through this announcement will provide communities with the resources needed to ensure that more Americans have the safety and stability of a home.""
The Continuum of Care Program is the largest source of federal grant funding for homeless services and housing programs serving people experiencing homelessness. By statute, CoC Program grants must be awarded through an annual NOFO to which nearly 400 Continuum of Care communities apply for grants for approximately 7,000 homeless services projects. This includes both renewals of existing grants and grants for new projects.
Due to COVID-19, HUD was granted authority to renew grants without a NOFO in FY 2020. Therefore, this NOFO will be the first CoC Program NOFO since the COVID-19 pandemic.
As with prior NOFOs, Continuums of Care will have the opportunity to renew existing projects, apply for new projects, and to reallocate resources from lower performing projects to better serve people experiencing homelessness. However, this year's NOFO includes some new opportunities. The FY 2021 CoC Program NOFO will, for the first time, invite Indian Tribes and Tribally Designated Housing entities (TDHE) to apply for grants through the CoC program. Additionally, the NOFO will provide $102 million for new rapid re-housing, supportive services and other activities critical to assist survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking.
As the first CoC Program NOFO of the Biden-Harris Administration, this NOFO reflects the Administration's commitment to equity and evidence-based solutions to address homelessness. Specifically, HUD is seeking projects that:
End homelessness for all persons experiencing homelessness; Use a Housing First approach; Reduce unsheltered homelessness and reduce the criminalization of homelessness; Improve system performance; Partner with housing and health agencies, including to leverage and coordinate American Rescue Plan resources; Advance racial equity and addressing racial disparities in homelessness; and Engage people with lived experience of homelessness in decision-making.

Background:
Facing a pandemic, unprecedented economic downturn, profound climate crisis, and persistent racial injustices, President Biden outlined an ambitious agenda that would position America not just to return to where we were pre-pandemic, but to build back better toward a more sustainable, resilient, equitable, and prosperous future.
Driven by the largest shortfall of new housing units in 50 years, rents and housing prices continue to increase-with some 10.5 million renters paying more than half their incomes in rent. The Build Back Better Agenda will use tax credits and government financing to bolster affordable and resilient housing, supporting the construction or rehabilitation of more than two million homes."

EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take three months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, six months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2 percent) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percentage change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percentage changes are 90 percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percentage changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised 3 percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau's website (www.census.gov/construction/nrs/how_the_data_are_collected/index.html)."

Fudge, U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen, and Attorney General of the U.S. Department of Justice Merrick B. Garland sent a letter to state and local government leaders addressing the eviction moratorium.
The full text of the letter is available here and below.
Governors, Mayors, County Executives, and Chief Justices/State Court Administrators:
We are writing to request your urgent help preventing unnecessary evictions during the pandemic. Our bottom line is this: No one should be evicted before they have the chance to apply for rental assistance, and no eviction should move forward until that application has been processed.
Though over 172 million Americans are now fully vaccinated, and COVID-19 deaths are down over 80 percent compared to January of this year, significant work remains to defeat the virus and rebuild our economy. The spread of the Delta variant has led to a rise in cases, many Americans are just getting back on their feet from the economic downturn, and millions remain at risk of eviction. With lives on the line, it is imperative that we act-at all levels of government-to keep people in their homes and prevent a surge in COVID-19, as well as the long-term economic scarring and poor health consequences that come with eviction.
The Treasury Department remains laser-focused on partnering with state and local governments to get Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) funds out the door and into the hands of renters and landlords, including through recent guidance emphasizing the flexibility grantees have to simplify application processes and accelerate the delivery of assistance.
The Department of Justice recently sent a letter to state court Chief Justices and court administrators encouraging them to implement eviction diversion programs that delay or stop eviction proceedings until renters and landlords have had the chance to apply for rental assistance. The Attorney General and Associate Attorney General also met with over 35 Chief Justices from around the country to listen to their concerns and discuss ways the federal government can support implementation of these programs.
Similarly, the Department of Housing and Urban Development has required public housing authorities and properties receiving federal project-based rental assistance to offer protections that will provide tenants with a fair chance to receive emergency rent relief and to take other steps to help prevent evictions. Our three Departments are working closely together and with other agencies across the federal government to make rental assistance available to households in need.
We also know we cannot address this challenge alone. State and local governments play a crucial role as administrators of programs like ERA and as leaders of their own housing agencies, judiciary systems, and other components of government that are essential to keeping Americans in their homes. Today, we are urging you to exercise your own authorities-as states, cities, and counties representing millions of Americans already have-to take action to prevent unnecessary evictions, including:
Enacting state and local eviction moratoriums during the remainder of the public health emergency. Six states and the District of Columbia already have eviction moratoriums in place. As the President called for, we are encouraging all other state and local governments to use their legal authorities to appropriately put in place or extend their own eviction moratoriums. Working with state and local courts to require landlords to apply for ERA before they commence eviction proceedings. State and local governments or courts should ensure that all tenants have the opportunity to apply for rental assistance before any proceedings begin, and landlords seeking eviction should be required to apply for rental assistance first-a policy already implemented in some states and localities. Staying eviction proceedings while an ERA application is pending. By taking this step, as some states and localities already have, courts can ensure that tenants have a fair opportunity to apply for federal aid and that unnecessary evictions are avoided. While we call on courts to stay eviction proceedings, state and local governments must also speed the delivery of rental assistance to meet courts' deadlines. Using ERA and American Rescue Plan State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds to support the right to counsel and eviction diversion strategies. Tenants are more likely to avoid eviction and remain stably housed when they have access to legal representation. Legal counsel can also aid in the successful completion of ERA applications. We encourage state and local governments to use ERA and Fiscal Recovery Funds to launch right to counsel programs and invest in court navigators and diversion programs. Helping tenants navigate the ERA application process. The Treasury Department has issued recent guidance streamlining the ERA application process, for example, by making clear that grantees can rely on self-attestation from tenants for certain eligibility requirements. State and local governments can continue to build on these efforts by removing unnecessary barriers to ERA funds.
• Enacting state and local eviction moratoriums during the remainder of the public health emergency. Six states and the District of Columbia already have eviction moratoriums in place. As the President called for, we are encouraging all other state and local governments to use their legal authorities to appropriately put in place or extend their own eviction moratoriums.
• Working with state and local courts to require landlords to apply for ERA before they commence eviction proceedings. State and local governments or courts should ensure that all tenants have the opportunity to apply for rental assistance before any proceedings begin, and landlords seeking eviction should be required to apply for rental assistance first-a policy already implemented in some states and localities.
• Staying eviction proceedings while an ERA application is pending. By taking this step, as some states and localities already have, courts can ensure that tenants have a fair opportunity to apply for federal aid and that unnecessary evictions are avoided. While we call on courts to stay eviction proceedings, state and local governments must also speed the delivery of rental assistance to meet courts' deadlines.
• Using ERA and American Rescue Plan State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds to support the right to counsel and eviction diversion strategies. Tenants are more likely to avoid eviction and remain stably housed when they have access to legal representation. Legal counsel can also aid in the successful completion of ERA applications. We encourage state and local governments to use ERA and Fiscal Recovery Funds to launch right to counsel programs and invest in court navigators and diversion programs.

The Treasury Department has issued recent guidance streamlining the ERA application process, for example, by making clear that grantees can rely on self-attestation from tenants for certain eligibility requirements. State and local governments can continue to build on these efforts by removing unnecessary barriers to ERA funds.
The ERA program and the State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds have provided state and local governments tens of billions of dollars to support renters and landlords; it is critical that renters be given the chance to receive that aid before being subject to eviction. Many state and local governments are working hard to get rental assistance to those in need as quickly as possible, and these policies will help ensure renters are not evicted before those resources reach them.
We applaud the efforts of the state and local governments that have already taken these and other actions to prevent unnecessary evictions, as we know many of you have. However, we also know more must be done and that effective and comprehensive policies to prevent unnecessary evictions have never been more urgent. We stand ready to partner with and support you in any way we can to protect renters and landlords and make programs like ERA as effective as possible.
Thank you for all you are doing and will continue to do to keep Americans in their homes. We will continue to engage with you over the coming days and weeks as we take on this challenge, and we welcome your input as we work together to prevent unnecessary evictions and help households in need reach the other side of this pandemic safely.

09/01/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-129.cfm,HUD Announces Cross-Agency Efforts to Increase Affordable Housing Supply,"FACT SHEET: Biden-Harris Administration Announces Immediate Steps to Increase Affordable Housing Supply (www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/09/01/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-immediate-steps-to-increase-affordable-housing-supply/)
WASHINGTON - The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) on Wednesday announced a series of actions it is taking as part of the Biden-Harris Administration's plan (www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/09/01/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-immediate-steps-to-increase-affordable-housing-supply/) to create, preserve, and sell nearly 100,000 additional affordable homes for homeowners and renters across the country over the next three years. As Congress and President Biden work toward the historic housing investment in the Build Back Better agenda, HUD is acting in its administrative capacity to unlock and create affordable housing supply for lower income segments of the market.
Today's actions include a significant step in restarting the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) Section 542 (c) Housing Finance Agency Risk-Sharing Program with the Department of Treasury's Federal Financing Bank (FFB Risk-Sharing) which provides low-cost capital needed to spur development of rental housing in cooperation with state Housing Finance Agencies (HFAs). This agreement marks a renewed focus on supporting construction and development of affordable housing units in states across the country at a time when these kinds of capital investments for the most affordable housing are needed.
""President Biden promised the American people that his Administration would dramatically expand our nation's supply of affordable rental housing—and the actions announced today represent a significant down payment toward that commitment,"" said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""These actions will expand access to critical capital for state Housing Finance Agencies, empower local communities to build more affordable housing using the historic investments contained in the American Rescue Plan, and advance equitable housing policies such as inclusionary zoning practices. Moving forward, HUD and the Biden-Harris Administration will continue to pursue bold actions to create and preserve affordable homes for all Americans.""
Housing Finance Agencies may submit applications for mortgage insurance through this program through September 2024, and for the Federal Financing Bank to purchase the FHA-insured mortgages through September 2027. Unlike the previous version of the program, there is no dollar cap so FHA can provide firm approval letters to insure all eligible HFA-underwritten mortgages that meet risk-sharing program standards.
HUD will make more single-family homes available to individuals, families, and non-profit organizations in the future by prioritizing homeownership and limiting the sale to large investors of certain FHA-insured and HUD-owned properties, in addition to expanding and creating exclusivity periods in which only governmental entities, owner occupants, and qualified non-profit organizations are able to bid on certain FHA-insured properties. In addition, HUD's Community Development and Planning (CPD) arm announced it is creating a new toolkit with guidance to support HUD grantees by providing easy-to-implement strategies to deploy resources to address housing supply and affordability challenges that have deepened during the pandemic. Finally, HUD's Policy Development and Research (PD&R) team will release its latest research on innovative strategies being pursued by state and local governments to remove regulatory barriers to affordable housing and increase housing supply. These lessons will be incorporated into HUDs Regulatory Barriers Clearinghouse, which contains over 4800 barriers and solutions and provides a catalog of information that spans all 50 states and over 460 cities and counties. They will also inform the locally driven zoning reform initiative in the President's Build Back Better Plan.

About the Section 542(c) Housing Finance Agency Risk-Sharing Program with the Federal Financing Bank
The Section 542(c) Housing Finance Agency Risk-Sharing program allows eligible Housing Finance Agencies (HFAs) to enter into contracts with HUD that provide FHA insurance on Multifamily mortgages for properties with affordable housing units underwritten by an HFA, and where HUD and the HFA share the risk of any potential loss if the mortgage defaults. With the FHA insurance credit enhancement, the Federal Financing Bank will purchase the mortgage, generating capital funds for the HFA to lend to private developers building or rehabilitating multifamily properties that provide affordable rental homes, including refinance of properties for low, very-low, and extremely-low income individuals. FHA will continue to seek necessary authority to further enhance the mortgage securitization eligibility features of the program.
FHA encourages qualified Housing Finance Agencies across the country to apply to participate in the program's restart. Further, based on past program performance, FHA anticipates that approximately 20,000 affordable rental units will be created or preserved through the program through 2027. FHA anticipates it may receive new mortgage insurance applications under the program this month."

09/01/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-131.cfm,HUD Approves Disaster Mitigation Plan to Build Resilience to Future Wildfires in California,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today signed off on California's second Community Development Block Grant Mitigation (CDBG-MIT) Program Action Plan, approving the state's proposed uses of previously-allocated disaster mitigation funds to build resilience to future wildfires.
""As conflagrations in California continue to force evacuations and destroy communities, we recognize the urgency of building resilience to future wildfires,"" said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""HUD's approval of California's Action Plan brings the state one step closer to investing its federal funds in mitigation activities to protect communities from the damage of future disasters and support public safety. HUD looks forward to continuing to work with California so that they can get their disaster mitigation funds out the door as soon as possible.""
In 2017 and 2018, HUD awarded California CDBG-MIT funds totaling $106,554,272 for resilient infrastructure, $38,926,378 for planning and public services, and $7,645,350 for administration of the funds. With HUD's approval of California's second Action Plan - submitted to the department on July 9, 2021 - the state can expend the 2018 funds, once obligated, on the disaster mitigation activities proposed in its plan. California's 2017 CDBG-MIT allocations were obligated on August 14, 2020.
Specifically, HUD today approved California's proposal to allocate:
Approximately $45.2 million from the 2018 allocation for infrastructure needs that meet the definition of mitigation activities. Local jurisdictions will receive funds for mitigation projects to support risk reduction from three primary hazards (wildfire, flooding, and earthquake). Potential projects include: Roadway improvements for ingress/egress and evacuation routes; Fuel breaks and reduction measures; Watershed management activities; Defensible space; Hardening of communication systems; and Flood drainage measures. Approximately $16.5 million from the 2018 allocation to support public education and awareness related to risks and vulnerabilities and actions that can be taken to prepare for future disasters. Projects for planning and public services may address risks to, or across, community lifelines that support human health and safety and provide mitigation for individual and community-based systems. Potential projects include: Creation of or updates to Community Wildfire Protection Plans; Addition of resilience or safety elements to comprehensive plans; Establishment of outreach and educational campaigns; and Funding for local governments and non-profit organizations to perform additional services to inform the public on resilient-minded activities. Approximately $3.2 million from the 2018 allocation for costs necessary for the general administration of the CDBG-MIT grant.

09/02/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-132.cfm,HUD Awards Over $47 Million to Fight Housing Discrimination,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today awarded $47.4 million to fair housing organizations across the country under its Fair Housing Initiatives Program (FHIP). The grants will support the efforts of 120 national and local fair housing organizations working to address violations of the Fair Housing Act and helping to end discrimination in housing. (See the list of grantees below.)
The grant funding will allow the grantees to provide fair housing enforcement by conducting investigations, testing to identify discrimination in the rental and sales markets, and filing fair housing complaints with HUD. In addition, grantees will carry out education and outreach activities to inform the public, housing providers, and local governments about their rights and responsibilities under the Fair Housing Act.
""The fair housing groups' HUD funds are a critical piece of combatting housing discrimination,"" said Jeanine Worden, HUD's Acting Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""The grants we're announcing today will enable 120 fair housing groups to combat unfair evictions and other housing practices that violate the Fair Housing Act.""
HUD is awarding grants today in the following categories:
Private Enforcement Initiative (PEI) - $34,556,620 is being awarded to organizations that conduct intake and testing and that investigate and litigate fair housing complaints under the Fair Housing Act. Education and Outreach Initiative (EOI) - $10,747,218 is being awarded to organizations that educate the public and housing providers about the Fair Housing Act. These grants will also support state and local organizations that enhance fair housing laws that are substantially equivalent to the Fair Housing Act.

09/03/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-133.cfm,HUD Charges Florida Homeowner Association with Discriminating Against Resident with Disabilities,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has charged The Links South at Harbour Village Condominium Association, in Ponce Inlet, Florida, with discrimination because of disability when it denied a reasonable accommodation request. Specifically, because of the husband's respiratory disabilities, a couple asked to be able to keep their shoes outside their unit in order to limit exposure to outdoor allergens, chemicals or pollutants inside their home. Read HUD's Charge.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to refuse to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services, when such accommodations may be necessary to afford a person with disabilities an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.
""It is critically important that individuals with disabilities be granted the reasonable accommodations they need to use and enjoy the place they call home,"" said Jeanine Worden, HUD's Acting Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""When a person with a disability requests a reasonable accommodation, a small exception or modification to a housing provider's rules can make a big difference in the health and well-being of an individual with a disability.""
The case came to HUD's attention when a married couple filed a complaint of housing discrimination. The husband, a retired New York City sanitation superintendent, spent more than 400 days removing debris from the World Trade Center site after September 11th. As a result, he was diagnosed with upper respiratory disabilities and other medical conditions that are certified for coverage under the World Trade Center Health Program. HUD's Charge alleges that the condominium community's homeowner association refused to allow the couple to keep their shoes outside the front door to prevent tracking in contaminants that negatively impact the husband due to his disability. The Charge further alleges that the couple provided medical documentation from the husband's physician advising of the need to keep their home free from outdoor allergens, chemicals, or pollutants. Nevertheless, the homeowner association refused to grant the couple's accommodation request, and instead made repeated demands for further documentation.
""Refusing to grant reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities is simply illegal, and so is making repeated requests for unnecessary documentation,"" said Damon Smith, HUD's General Counsel. ""HUD is dedicated to eliminating barriers that prevent persons with disabilities from having an equal opportunity to enjoy their homes.""
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge. If, after a hearing, the administrative law judge finds that discrimination has occurred, the judge may award damages to the complainants for their losses that have resulted from the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties in order to vindicate the public interest.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 877-8339 (Relay). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to hud.gov/fairhousing."
09/07/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-134.cfm,HUD Cuts Red Tape to Help Communities Respond to Hurricane,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced a package of 27 regulatory and administrative waivers aimed at helping communities to accelerate their recovery from Hurricane Ida. Today's announcement represents one of the largest collections of regulatory and administrative waivers ever issued by the Department at one time.
""HUD is doing everything in its power to ensure that our response to the devastation of Hurricane Ida meets the magnitude of the crisis,"" said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""With these waivers, we are giving our state and local partners the flexibility they need to more expeditiously recover and rebuild from the storm.""
The regulatory and administrative relief announced today covers the following HUD programs: The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program, HOME Investment Partnerships (HOME) Program, Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) Program, and Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG) Program. To expedite the use of these funds, HUD's state and local partners can now access a waiver through a new simplified notification process. HUD's flexibilities include:
HUD is allowing for an abbreviated public comment requirement on changes to a grantee's community redevelopment plans. Upon notification, HUD will reduce the customary 30-day comment period to seven days. This temporary allowance balances the need to help local communities more quickly while continuing to provide reasonable notice and opportunity for citizens to comment on the proposed uses of funds. Hurricane Ida hurt communications networks. Therefore, HUD is waiving the normal communication requirements and allowing these grantees to determine what constitutes reasonable notice and opportunity to comment. These hurricanes caused extensive damage and destruction to the housing stock in certain impacted areas. To accelerate new housing construction, HUD is suspending normal rules to enable CDBG grantees to replace affordable housing units that were lost as a result of the hurricanes and flooding. HUD recognizes that affected citizens may require additional time and effort to execute their recovery plans. Consequently, HUD will suspend a cap limiting CDBG expenditures for public services to 15 percent. HUD will temporarily allow CDBG grantees to pay for additional support services for individuals and families affected by the hurricanes. Services could include, but not be limited to, the provision of food, emergency shelter, case management and related services to help residents in declared-disaster areas until long-term recovery resources become available.

09/08/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-137.cfm,HUD Releases New Research on Increasing Affordable Housing Production and Preservation,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today released its latest research on innovative strategies being pursued by state and local governments to remove regulatory barriers to affordable housing and increase housing supply.
""This research is a testament to the Biden-Harris Administration's commitment to increasing and preserving our nation's affordable housing supply,"" said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""The research makes clear that there is bipartisan support for state and local reform to improve housing affordability, and underscores how the President's Build Back Better Agenda would strengthen the federal government's capacity to help jurisdictions meet the housing needs of their residents. HUD and the Administration will remain hard at work to build inclusive, equitable communities through affordable housing.""
The new research (www.huduser.gov/portal/pdredge/pdr-edge-trending-090721.html), published by HUD's Office of Policy Development & Research (PD&R), was promised as part of the Department's September 1 announcement of a series of actions it is taking as part of the Biden-Harris Administration's plan to create, preserve, and sell nearly 100,000 additional affordable homes for homeowners and renters across the country over the next three years. As stated in that announcement, the lessons from the research ""will be incorporated into HUD's Regulatory Barriers Clearinghouse, which contains over 4800 barriers and solutions and provides a catalog of information that spans all 50 states and over 460 cities and counties. They will also inform the locally driven zoning reform initiative in the President's Build Back Better Plan.""
According to this new research, ""Opportunities to Increase Housing Production and Preservation,"" without significant new supply, cost burdens are likely to increase as current home prices reach all-time highs, with the median home sales price reaching nearly $375,000 (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MSPUS) in July 2021. The research also makes clear the consequences that inadequate housing supply will have on homeowners and renters. In 2019, more than 37 million renter and owner households (www.jchs.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/reports/files/Harvard_JCHS_The_State_of_the_Nations_ Housing_2020_Report_Revised_120720.pdf) spent more than 30 percent of their income for housing.
The new research cites two reports - a HUD-published (www.huduser.gov/portal/sites/default/files/pdf/section-5-state-local-and-tribal-opportunities.pdf) report from January 2021 under the previous administration and a June 2021 report (www.huduser.gov/portal/publications/New-Housing-Production-Report.html) to Congress - that highlight actions state and local governments are taking to reduce barriers that are limiting housing production and preservation. These activities range from state tax policies and incentives to encourage local housing production to local zoning changes, process improvements, and community engagement reforms.
Additionally, the research highlights HUD tools and grant opportunities to assist jurisdictions seeking to increase the supply of affordable housing in their communities, and makes clear that ""a comprehensive zoning reform program, such as the one proposed in the Build Back Better Plan currently before Congress, would enhance HUD's efforts to help communities plan and implement housing policy reforms, study the impact of those reforms, and share the most effective approaches to community engagement and policy actions."""

09/10/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-139.cfm,"HUD Announces Waivers to Help New Jersey, New York Communities Respond to Remnants of Hurricane Ida","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced a package of 27 regulatory and administrative waivers aimed at helping communities in New Jersey and New York to accelerate their recovery from the remnants of Hurricane Ida. Today's announcement, following the pattern of similar waivers issued earlier this month for communities initially hit by Hurricane Ida, represents one of the largest collections of regulatory and administrative waivers ever issued by the Department at one time.
""HUD is doing everything in its power to ensure that our response to the devastation of Hurricane Ida meets the magnitude of the crisis,"" said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""With these waivers, we are giving our state and local partners the flexibility they need to more expeditiously recover and rebuild from the storm.""
The regulatory and administrative relief announced today covers the following HUD programs: The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program, HOME Investment Partnerships (HOME) Program, Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) Program, Continuum of Care (CoC) Program, and Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG) Program. To expedite the use of these funds, HUD's state and local partners can now access a waiver through a new simplified notification process. HUD's flexibilities include:
HUD is allowing for an abbreviated public comment requirement on changes to a grantee's community redevelopment plans. Upon notification, HUD will reduce the customary 30-day comment period to seven days. This temporary allowance balances the need to help local communities more quickly while continuing to provide reasonable notice and opportunity for citizens to comment on the proposed uses of funds. The remnants of Hurricane Ida disrupted communications networks. Therefore, HUD is waiving the normal communication requirements and allowing these grantees to determine what constitutes reasonable notice and opportunity to comment. This storm caused extensive damage and destruction to the housing stock in certain impacted areas. To accelerate new housing construction, HUD is suspending normal rules to enable CDBG grantees to replace affordable housing units that were lost as a result of the heavy rain and flooding. HUD recognizes that affected citizens may require additional time and effort to execute their recovery plans. Consequently, HUD will suspend a cap limiting CDBG expenditures for public services to 15 percent. HUD will temporarily allow CDBG grantees to pay for additional support services for individuals and families affected by the remnants of the hurricane. Services could include, but not be limited to, the provision of food, emergency shelter, case management and related services to help residents in declared-disaster areas until long-term recovery resources become available.

The transaction, which closed on September 9, 2021, provides FHA insurance on the $320 million supplemental mortgage obtained by the hospital under FHA's Section 241(a) supplemental mortgage insurance program. The transaction will provide funds to allow the hospital to create a new facility to expand its acute care and other services. UNMH is the only Level I trauma hospital and children's hospital in the state and is the closest major healthcare facility for more than half of New Mexico's population.
""As the nation continues to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, we've seen the devastating outcome that limited critical care space can have despite the heroic efforts of the nation's doctors, nurses, and first responders,"" said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""Expanding facilities like The University of New Mexico Hospital will provide vital critical care services to New Mexico's residents, along with the access to healthcare information and preventive measures that can save more people during a national health emergency.""
""The UNMH team is pleased to continue our collaborative partnership with HUD,"" said UNMH CEO Kate Becker, JD, MPH. ""This will enable us to provide increased access to health care for New Mexicans in New Mexico.""
Under FHA's Section 241(a) supplemental mortgage insurance program, FHA insures the mortgage obtained by UNMH through Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. UNMH will use the proceeds of the transaction to construct a new facility and transition its existing facility into a center for women's and children's services.
About FHA's Section 242 Mortgage Insurance for Hospital Facilities and Section 241(a) Supplemental Mortgage Insurance Programs
FHA's Office of Hospital Facilities (OHF) manages the Section 242 program, which provides mortgage insurance for acute care hospital facilities ranging from large teaching institutions to small rural critical access hospitals. FHA's Section 241(a) program insures supplemental mortgages for hospitals and residential care facilities with FHA-insured first mortgages or HUD-held mortgages to finance repairs, additions, and improvements. The program is intended to keep the facilities competitive, extend their economic life, and to finance the replacement of obsolete equipment. As of June 30, 2021, FHA had active insurance on more than 4,000 mortgages for hospitals and residential care facilities."

Under the regular HOME program, grantees must wait until their allocation plans are completed and approved by HUD in order to access funds. Given HOME-ARP's focus on addressing the urgent needs of people experiencing and at-risk of homelessness, HUD is providing grantees with five percent of their HOME-ARP grant upfront to support eligible program planning activities related to the development of their HOME-ARP Allocation Plans. Participating jurisdictions will be provided access to the balance of its HOME-ARP grant, including the remaining 10 percent of its administrative and planning set-aside, after HUD reviews and accepts its HOME-ARP Allocation Plan.
The $4.925 billion in HOME-ARP funding will play a critical role in developing housing to address homelessness and homelessness risk among extremely low-income households. The funding also gives participating jurisdictions flexibility to best meet the needs of people experiencing or at - risk of experiencing homelessness, including through the development of affordable housing and permanent supportive housing, the provision of tenant-based rental assistance, the delivery of supportive services, and acquisition and development of non-congregate shelter units."

09/15/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-147.cfm,HUD Awards $142 Million to Help End Youth Homelessness,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is awarding $142 million to build systems to end youth homelessness in 33 local communities, including 11 rural communities. HUD's Youth Homelessness Demonstration Program (YHDP) will support a wide range of housing programs including rapid rehousing, permanent supportive housing, transitional housing, and host homes.
""The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated nearly every crisis in our society, including the crisis of youth homelessness,"" said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""Our society is judged by how we treat the most vulnerable among us. We have a responsibility in our nation to care for all our children and with this funding, HUD is taking steps to make sure that every child under our care has a safe place to call home.""
The Department continues to work closely with youth to develop and improve YHDP, relying upon the recommendations provided directly from young people who had experienced homelessness. Additionally, HUD partnered with youth with lived experience to assess the nearly 100 applications that were submitted for funding consideration. Their assessment helped HUD ensure that applicants understood the needs and preferences of the young people they will serve. The Department also worked closely with its federal partners to help develop the program and review applications, including the Departments of Health and Human Services, the Department of Education, and the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness.
YHDP recipients will use this to address youth homelessness that is specifically tailored to their needs, including funding for housing units, wrap-around services and housing support. YHDP will also support youth-focused performance measurement and coordinated entry systems. Over the next several months, selected communities will work with their youth advisory boards, child welfare agencies, and other community partners to create a comprehensive community plan to end youth homelessness. The awarded communities will also participate in a program evaluation to inform the federal effort to prevent and end youth homelessness going forward and will serve as leaders in the nation on the work to end homelessness among young people.
HUD is awarding grants to the following communities where local applicants expressed their own vision for ending youth homelessness:

Owners of properties participating in HUD's Section 202 Housing for Low- and Very-Low Income Elderly, Section 811 Housing for Low- and Very-Low Income Persons with Disabilities, and Section 8 Project-based Rental Assistance programs are eligible to receive reimbursements from this pool of funds. The deadline for applications is November 19, 2021.
""The critical funds we are making available will help owners to ensure the health, safety, and well-being of residents and staff and make more improvements that can help combat future health emergencies,"" said HUD Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Office of Housing Lopa Kolluri.
""The additional flexibilities in this Notice respond to feedback from program participants and build on our own observations of how these resources can best meet the most pressing needs,"" said HUD Deputy Assistant Secretary for Multifamily Housing Ethan Handelman.

09/17/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-151.cfm,HUD Charges Missouri Housing Providers with Housing Discrimination,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is charging Daniel J. Felder and Andrea Williams, as co-guardians and conservators of the Felder Peter King Estate of Ward Protectee, the Estate, and Eric Felder, the owners and property manager of duplex and triplex apartments in St. Charles, Missouri, with housing discrimination for allegedly refusing to rent an apartment to a prospective tenant because he has two children. Read HUD's charge.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from denying or limiting housing to families with children under the age of 18.
""Families today face enough challenges without being denied a place to call home because they have children,"" said Jeanine Worden, HUD's Acting Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Today's action reaffirms HUD's commitment to ensuring that housing providers meet their obligation to treat all home seekers equally, including those with children.""
The case came to HUD's attention when the father of two filed a complaint alleging that he was denied the opportunity to rent an apartment because he has young children. The father claimed that he reached out to the property manager about the unit and told the manager that his young son and daughter would be living with him. HUD's charge alleges that, subsequent to that conversation, the manager informed the father that he could not rent the unit, saying his boss ""gave me a firm 'No.' She's against little kids in such a small place."" As a result, the father was forced to rent a more expensive unit in the area.
""Housing providers are required by law to rent to families with children. HUD will enforce the law to ensure that families with children can get the housing they need,"" said Damon Smith, HUD General Counsel.
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party elects for the case to be heard in federal court. If the administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, the judge may award damages to the complainant for losses that have resulted from the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties in order to vindicate the public interest. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 877-8339 (Relay). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to hud.gov/fairhousing."
09/20/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-152.cfm,Biden-Harris Administration Launches House America Initiative to Address Homelessness Crisis,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Marcia L. Fudge, who serves as chair of the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH), today joined Biden-Harris Administration officials, Cabinet members, and elected officials to launch House America: An All-Hands-On-Deck Effort to Address the Nation's Homelessness Crisis. House America is a national partnership in which HUD and USICH invite mayors, county leaders, Tribal nation leaders, and governors to use the historic investments provided through the American Rescue Plan to address the crisis of homelessness (www.usich.gov/resources/uploads/asset_library/USICH_American_Rescue_Plan_Guide.pdf) through a Housing First approach by immediately re-housing and building additional housing for people experiencing homelessness.
""The pandemic has shown us that we, as a nation, are only as strong as the most vulnerable among us,"" said Secretary Fudge. ""Addressing homelessness is not only about helping the individuals and families who face the greatest housing challenges, but also about the well-being and economic security of our communities and our whole nation. It's going to take government working at all levels to address homelessness and to guarantee housing as a right for every American. The Biden-Harris Administration looks forward to working alongside state and local partners on solutions that help to eradicate homelessness. By leveraging American Rescue Plan resources and other federal funds through a Housing First approach, we can ensure more people have a safe, stable place to call home.""
House America is the federal government's direct response to the crisis of homelessness, which was rising even before the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic. In March, HUD released its 2020 Annual Homeless Assessment Report Part 1 to Congress (www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/ahar/2020-ahar-part-1-pit-estimates-of-homelessness-in-the-us.html), which found that more than 580,000 people experienced homelessness in the United States on a single night in January 2020, prior to the pandemic. COVID-19 has created greater urgency to address homelessness, given the heightened risks faced by people experiencing homelessness. At the same time, COVID-19 has slowed re-housing activities due to capacity issues and impacts on rental market vacancies.
Through the American Rescue Plan, communities now have historic housing resources - 70,000 emergency housing vouchers, $5 billion in HOME grants, and significant investments to preserve and protect housing on tribal lands - to help more Americans obtain the safety of a stable home. The American Rescue Plan also provides $350 billion in State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds through the Department of the Treasury to support the many needs communities face, including homelessness and housing instability, as they respond to the pandemic and its negative economic impacts.
Communities also have resources remaining through the CARES Act, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021, and state and local resources to re-house people experiencing homelessness and create additional dedicated housing units to address homelessness. House America provides communities with the focus, resolve, and technical know-how needed to deploy these resources to maximize impact.
House America calls on state, tribal, and local leaders to partner with HUD to use American Rescue Plan resources, alongside other federal, tribal, state, and local resources to set and achieve ambitious goals to re-house households experiencing homelessness through a Housing First approach, and to add new units of affordable housing that address homelessness into the development pipeline by December 31, 2022. Within those national goals, communities will set and achieve local re-housing and unit creation goals.
Secretary Fudge launched House America during a virtual event, which included panel discussions on re-housing and unit creation. Secretary Fudge was joined at the virtual launch by:

09/21/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-153.cfm,HUD Announces HBCU Center of Excellence Grants,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) on Tuesday announced a total of $5.5 million will be awarded to two Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). Howard University and Texas Southern University will received $4.5 million and $1 million, respectively, to establish Centers of Excellence (COE) for housing and economic development research.
""HUD is proud to forge new partnerships with academia to build on research and innovation that will better inform the housing and community development needs of historically underserved communities,"" said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""We look forward to the advancements and contributions Howard University and Texas Southern University-both esteemed HBCUs-will make using these grants.""
The grants will be used to provide the universities with funding to conduct research on the topics of housing and economic development, particularly in underserved communities. The universities submitted proposals to carry out a series of reports focused on housing, community, and economic development in underserved communities that can serve as national, local, or regional benchmarks and will also assist in support of COE(s) that expand the housing and community development research efforts at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU).
Project Descriptions:
• Howard University was awarded $4.5M from HUD to fund their proposal to establish a Center of Excellence (COE), setting a goal of achieving an equitable and inclusionary society where currently underserved populations come to be properly served and inequities in housing, health, education, economic well-being, and community development, are overcome through policy implementation.
• Texas Southern University (TSU) was awarded $1M by HUD to fund their proposal to establish a Center of Excellence, that will advance transdisciplinary academic and empirical research and debate on affordable housing and community development policy for racial equity benefiting low-income communities of color in the six major Texas cities (Austin, Dallas, El Paso, Fort Worth, Houston, and San Antonio)."
09/22/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-154.cfm,HUD and FHFA Announce Clarifications to Freddie Mac's Policies on Purchasing Mortgages Secured by Group Homes,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) on Wednesday announced important clarifications to Freddie Mac's policies that make clear it will purchase mortgages secured by a property owned by an individual and rented to a group home for persons with disabilities.
""Clarifying these policies regarding the eligibility of group homes for the secondary mortgage market is an important step to fulfilling the Fair Housing Act's promise of providing individuals with disabilities equal access to housing opportunities,"" said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""We appreciate our colleagues at FHFA who share our goal of advancing fair housing and collaborated closely with us and Freddie Mac in helping to clarify these policies.""
""Group homes provide opportunities for persons with disabilities to live in the community among neighbors and access important opportunities for independent living,"" said FHFA Director Sandra L. Thompson. ""We are proud to stand with HUD to ensure that all people are afforded fair access to housing, recognizing that diverse experiences contribute to communities that thrive.""
Group homes, which are protected under the Fair Housing Act, are dwellings occupied by unrelated persons with disabilities and can provide them opportunities for ongoing interaction and socialization in a familial setting. This assurance that Freddie Mac will purchase mortgages secured by group homes, where the property is owned by an individual, should encourage lenders in extending credit for such mortgages, thus providing more community-based living opportunities for persons with disabilities. These clarifications were included in Freddie Mac's September 1 update to Freddie Mac's Seller/Servicer Guide.
The clarifications follow a HUD investigation of a mortgage lender who had refused to lend to a homeowner that was renting their property to a company that was operating a group home. The lender's refusal was based on the incorrect belief that Freddie Mac would not agree to buy the mortgage. After HUD reported this misunderstanding to Freddie Mac and FHFA, Freddie Mac worked with both agencies and ultimately agreed to revise its policies and make this announcement to clarify that Freddie Mac has always been willing to buy these mortgages secured by a group home.
HUD and FHFA recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to cooperate on fair housing and fair lending matters and strengthen oversight of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the Enterprises) and the primary mortgage market.
Group homes must still meet other eligibility requirements applicable to other transactions to be eligible for purchase by Freddie Mac."

This includes $1.0 million in expansion grants that will help house approximately 95 additional Veterans. The expansion grants were awarded to three existing Tribal HUD-VASH grant recipients and two new Tribal HUD-VASH grant recipients, Apsaalooke Nation Housing Authority and Fort Hall Housing Authority.
The Tribal HUD-VASH program provides housing and supportive services to Native American Veterans who are experiencing or at risk of experiencing homelessness by combining rental assistance from HUD with case management and clinical services provided by the VA. (See chart below.)
""Our nation's Veterans made the ultimate sacrifice and are more than deserving of a decent and stable place to call home,"" said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""These grants allow Tribes to provide housing and supportive services to Native American Veterans and their families. Today's announcement includes a strong expansion of this vital program that allows us to serve even more individuals in need.""
""It is exciting to see the growth of this program that serves American Indian and Alaska Native Veterans struggling with homelessness,"" said VA Secretary Denis McDonough. ""The expansion of existing programs and inclusion of additional Tribal locations means that Veterans will have access to housing and case management supportive services close to home. These services reinforce the value of caring for our Veterans who courageously served our great nation.""
In 2015, Congress authorized funding for a Tribal demonstration program in order to expand the HUD-VASH program into Indian Country. HUD was directed to coordinate with Tribes, TDHEs, and other appropriate Tribal organizations on the design of this program and to ensure the effective delivery of housing assistance and supportive services to eligible Native American Veterans. Since its inception, the program has housed almost 600 Native American Veterans and has provided case management services to many more. Tribes will be able to reach more Veterans with today's expansion of the program.

The awards were made under HUD's Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly program and will help fund the construction and operation of 1,484 new deeply rent-assisted units for low- and very low-income seniors who will pay rent based on their income. Several of the grantees will be creating mixed-income communities, building 701 additional affordable and market-rate units as part of these funded projects, for a total of 2,185 homes.
""These awards support the Biden-Harris Administration's commitment to increase housing stability among the nation's most vulnerable populations, including the very low-income seniors these grants will ultimately help,"" said Office of Housing Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary Lopa Kolluri.
Section 202 grants provide very low-income elderly persons 62 years of age or older with the opportunity to live independently in an environment that provides support services to meet their unique needs. HUD provides these funds to non-profit organizations in two forms:
Capital Advances: This is funding that covers the cost of developing, acquiring, or rehabilitating the development. Repayment is not required as long as the housing remains available for occupancy by very low-income elderly persons for at least 40 years. Project Rental Assistance Contracts: This is renewable project-based funding which covers the difference between residents' contributions toward rent and the cost of operating the project. Section 202 program eligibility requires residents to be very low-income or earning less than 50 percent of the area median income. However, most households in the Section 202 program earn less than 30 percent of the median for their area.

The Agreement resolves claims that the housing authority failed to fulfill a reasonable accommodation request to provide the tenant's brother with copies of all correspondence sent to the tenant, resulting in the tenant failing to respond to a recertification notice and being evicted. Read the Agreement.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from discriminating against people with disabilities, including refusing to make reasonable accommodations in policies or practices when such accommodations may be necessary to provide persons with disabilities an equal opportunity to use or enjoy a dwelling.
""Reasonable accommodations don't just make life easier for persons with disabilities - they ensure equal opportunity. In some instances, they can mean the difference between keeping or losing the place a person calls home,"" said Demetria McCain, HUD's Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD remains committed to doing all it can to ensure that housing providers meet their obligation to comply with the nation's housing laws.""
The case came to HUD's attention when the tenant filed a fair housing complaint alleging that the housing authority failed to provide her brother with copies of all correspondence, including her recertification notice, as part of a reasonable accommodation the tenant had in place. The tenant also alleged that the housing authority violated Section 504 of Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by recipients of federal financial assistance. As a result of the housing authority's failure to provide the tenant's brother with her recertification notice, the tenant lost her housing.
Under the Agreement, the housing authority will pay $10,000 to the tenant and provide fair housing training for its employees who work with the public. The housing authority will also vacate the tenant's eviction and waive the $3,516 eviction judgment that had been entered against her.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 877-8339 (Relay). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to hud.gov/fairhousing."

EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take three months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, six months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2 percent) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percentage change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percentage changes are 90 percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percentage changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised 3 percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau's website (www.census.gov/construction/nrs/how_the_data_are_collected/index.html)."

The program allows local governments to leverage 5 times their current CDBG grant into federally guaranteed loans large enough to pursue physical and economic revitalization projects capable of redeveloping entire neighborhoods. Public investment such as Section 108 loans can spur private economic activity, providing the resources or the confidence that private firms and individuals may need to invest in distressed areas.
Springfield's Section 108 loan guarantee will support the Main Street Convention District Overlay Zone Fund Project, with funds assisting in the purchase of vacant, abandoned, and foreclosed property located downtown to support redevelopment and revitalization of downtown Springfield.
""The cornerstone of HUD's Section 108 Loan Guarantee Program since its inception in 1978 has been its incredible flexibility,"" said Arthur Jemison, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development. ""Section 108 combines the programmatic flexibility of the CDBG program with flexible loan terms that, together, enable states and local governments to address their community and economic needs that cannot be met from other sources. With this loan guarantee, Springfield will have resources it needs to produce transformative results.""
After the passage of the Housing and Community Development Act in 1974, HUD's CDBG entitlement communities and states have leveraged their CDBG grant allocations into federally guaranteed loans for projects addressing economic development, affordable housing, infrastructure, and public facilities challenges. Since the beginning of the Program in 1978, Section 108 projects have supported over 600 community and state economic development and affordable housing rehab projects, and contributed to the creation of over 120,000 jobs. The program has also helped fund more than 250 public works and infrastructure projects and 240 housing projects. Section 108 grantees who leveraged other funding sources (federal, state, local, and private) secured, on average, $4.62 of additional funds for every $1 of Section 108 funding (see 2012 HUD report here (www.huduser.gov/portal/publications/pdf/HUD_Section108_LoanGuaranteeProgram.pdf)).
Local governments and states have direct access to the Section 108 Program. Smaller units of local government can access the program through their state, including colonias locations. Funding under Section 108 can be used to provide the necessary gap financing to enable large-scale development, New Market Tax Credit, and Low-Income Housing Tax Credit projects, allowing jurisdictions to take full advantage of federal public-private partnership incentives. Section 108 also provides the necessary inducement to catalyze investment from private lenders.
Activities eligible under Section 108 include:
Acquisition and site improvements (including clearance, remediation, and demolition) of real property Rehabilitation of publicly-owned real property Housing rehabilitation, including relocation costs Construction, reconstruction, or installation of public facilities (including street, sidewalk, and other site improvements) Clearance and demolition of structures on property acquired or rehabilitated with Section 108 funds Assistance to for-profit businesses, nonprofit subrecipients, and Community-Based Development Organizations (CBDOs) for economic development projects Debt service reserves
• Acquisition and site improvements (including clearance, remediation, and demolition) of real property
• Rehabilitation of publicly-owned real property
• Housing rehabilitation, including relocation costs
• Construction, reconstruction, or installation of public facilities (including street, sidewalk, and other site improvements)

• Assistance to for-profit businesses, nonprofit subrecipients, and Community-Based Development Organizations (CBDOs) for economic development projects
• Debt service reserves
As the need for economic recovery and community development continues, HUD's CDBG Section 108 serves as a critical source of federally guaranteed financing that helps to move projects forward and build strong, sustainable, inclusive communities.

09/29/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-162.cfm,HUD Charges Houston Rental Property Owners with Discriminating Against Person with Disabilities,"WASHINGTON - The U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has charged the owners of several residential properties in Houston, TX, with violating the Fair Housing Act by refusing to rent a house for use as a group home for persons with mental disabilities. Read HUD's Charge.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from denying housing to persons with disabilities or subjecting them to discriminatory terms or conditions. This prohibition includes the refusal by owners of rental properties to permit their use for operation of group homes that allow persons with disabilities to live in the community.
""Rental property owners do not have the right to unlawfully deny housing based on their perceptions about persons with disabilities,"" said Demetria McCain, HUD's Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD remains committed to taking action whenever individuals in a position to control access to housing fail to meet their responsibility to comply with the nation's housing laws.""
The case came to HUD's attention when a Texas Health and Human Services Commission contractor who provides housing and related services for persons with severe mental disabilities filed a complaint, alleging that she was denied the opportunity to rent a single-family home because her clients have mental disabilities. HUD's charge, filed on behalf of the woman, alleges that the owner stated to her: ""[O]ur neighborhood does not want those type of people. We are trying to get them out of our neighborhood.""
""The Fair Housing Act affords all persons the opportunity to enjoy housing free from discrimination, including people with mental disabilities who are in need of the safe and stable environment a group home can provide,"" said Damon Smith, HUD's General Counsel. ""As this charge demonstrates, HUD will protect the rights of persons with disabilities to live in their communities, free from unlawful discrimination.""
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party elects for the case to be heard in federal court. If the administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, the judge may award damages to the complainant for losses that have resulted from the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties in order to vindicate the public interest. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 877-8339 (Relay). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to hud.gov/fairhousing."

09/30/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-164.cfm,HUD Consent Order Settles Claims Involving New Hampshire Mobile Home Park Accused of Discriminating Against Tenant with Disabilities,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that Ralph W. Torr, The Ralph W. Torr Revocable Trust of 2000, and the Pauline Torr Revocable Trust of 2000, the owners and operators of the West Wind Estates II mobile home park in Rochester, New Hampshire, will pay $15,000 under a HUD Consent Order resolving allegations of disability discrimination. HUD's charge of discrimination alleged that the owners denied a prospective homebuyer the opportunity to purchase a home at the park by refusing to make a reasonable accommodation from their age restrictions to permit the homebuyer's son, who is a person with severe disabilities that require special care, to live with his mother at the property. The Initial Decision and Consent Order also requires the owners to attend fair housing training and revise the mobile home park's reasonable accommodation and 55-and-older housing community policies. Read HUD's Order.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from denying or limiting housing to persons with disabilities, or from refusing to make reasonable accommodations in their policies or practices when necessary to provide persons with disabilities an equal opportunity to use or enjoy a dwelling. While the Act permits housing providers, under certain circumstances, to maintain a general policy of offering housing only to persons over 55, those policies are subject to the reasonable accommodation requirement.
""Persons with disabilities often live with loved ones who provide care, including parents who may wish to live in housing for older persons,"" said Demetria McCain, HUD's Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Such arrangements are protected by law and HUD is committed to ensuring that individuals in a position to control access to housing are aware of their responsibility to comply with the nation's housing laws, particularly when it comes to reasonable accommodations.""
The case came to HUD's attention when the mother, a caregiver for her adult son, filed a complaint alleging that the owners and operators of the park refused her request to make an exception to the park's 55 and older age requirement to allow her son to live with her, preventing her from purchasing a home at the park. HUD filed a charge of discrimination on behalf of the mother and her son on July 22, 2021. HUD's charge alleged that the owners violated the Act by refusing to grant the mother's request and by denying the sale.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 877-8339 (Relay). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to hud.gov/fairhousing."

10/06/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-167.cfm,HUD to Issue Rule Protecting Tenants Facing Evictions for Non-Payment of Rent in HUD-Assisted Properties,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) on Wednesday announced that it will publish a rule that prohibits the eviction of tenants facing eviction for nonpayment of rent from HUD-subsidized public housing and certain properties with project-based rental assistance without providing a 30-day notice period that includes information about available federal emergency rental assistance.
The interim rule, which will be published in the Federal Register on Thursday, October 7, provides that when there is a national emergency-such as the COVID-19 pandemic-and federal money is allocated to help tenants facing eviction for nonpayment of rent, the HUD Secretary can (1) Expand the notice a covered landlord must give before such a tenant must vacate a unit from 14 days to 30 days; (2) Require landlords to provide information to the tenant regarding federal emergency rental relief along with the eviction notice; and (3) Require landlords to provide notice to all tenants in public housing of the availability of emergency rental assistance. Separately, HUD is publishing notices that invoke this new rule's authority and require provision of information regarding the Emergency Rental Assistance Program.
""For many months, our Department has worked with landlords and owners who do business with HUD to ensure they access the Emergency Rental Assistance Program and do everything they can to keep people housed,"" said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""This rule is a significant step in raising tenant awareness about the availability of funds that can assist them with past due rent and allowing them additional time to access relief that may stave off eviction entirely. HUD will continue to review additional actions to help protect individuals through the duration of the pandemic.""
This action reaffirms HUD's commitment to keeping people housed throughout the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic through the prevention of unnecessary evictions. The Biden-Harris Administration continues to take actions to accelerate aid to renters and landlords, and ensure available support quickly reaches families in need and most at risk of eviction.
This new rule builds on the work HUD is doing to ensure available support is reaching the families the Department serves. HUD has also taken the following actions to prevent evictions and inform communities of their responsibilities and rights:
Streamlined requirements to allow HUD-assisted households to quickly recertify their income if they have experienced a drop in income, ensuring that their housing remains stable; Released extensive eviction prevention resources for public housing authorities, Tribes, and Tribally-Designated Housing Entities that highlight best practices to keep families housed and answer frequently asked questions; Issued guidance through HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity to protect against selective evictions aimed at protected classes such as race and national origin in violation of the Fair Housing Act. This guidance also explains that the Act requires housing providers to make reasonable accommodations for tenants with disabilities, including exceptions or modifications to eviction policies and procedures that may be necessary because of tenants' disabilities. HUD allocated $19.4 million to provide support to fair housing enforcement organizations to respond to fair housing inquiries and complaints related to the pandemic; Released an inaugural Eviction Protection Grant Program that will fund $20 million for eviction protection and diversion services for low-income tenants at risk of or subject to eviction. More information on the Notice of Funding Opportunity can be found here; Supported HUD grantees and stakeholders to ensure the best use of the various relief resources, including the Emergency Rental Assistance Program, and HUD's various Native American housing programs to prevent evictions and homelessness.

10/07/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-168.cfm,HUD Releases Agency Climate Adaptation and Resilience Plan,"WASHINGTON - Today, as part of President Biden's whole-of-government approach to confronting the climate crisis, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) released its climate adaptation and resilience plan to ensure its facilities and operations adapt and are increasingly resilient to climate change impacts.
""With the Climate Adaptation Plan, HUD is taking an agency-wide approach in prioritizing climate resilience because we cannot put America on the path to building a stronger and more sustainable housing infrastructure without addressing the impacts of climate change,"" said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge.
Federal agencies, and the people they serve, face a multitude of risks caused by climate change. This includes rising costs to maintain and repair damaged infrastructure from more frequent and extreme weather events and health and safety challenges to the communities across the country. Acting now to manage climate risk will increase the resilience of communities to wildfires, extreme heat, tropical storms, heavy rains, and other disasters made worse by a changing climate.
To address these challenges, President Biden prioritized the revitalization of federal agency climate adaptation and resilience planning after a four-year pause. Through this approach, agencies developed adaptation and resilience plans, called ""climate action plans,"" to address their most significant climate risks and vulnerabilities. HUD's plan seeks to drive innovation, increase resilience to climate change, and support the President's commitment to implementing his Justice40 Initiative (www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/01/27/fact-sheet-president-biden-takes-executive-actions-to-tackle-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad-create-jobs-and-restore-scientific-integrity-across-federal-government/). The climate action plans were developed in response to President Biden's Executive Order on Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad (www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/27/executive-order-on-tackling-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad/).
As part of these efforts, agencies will embed adaptation and resilience planning and implementation throughout their programs and operations and will continually update their adaptation plans. In addition to these plans, President Biden's Build Back Better Agenda and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal (www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/08/02/updated-fact-sheet-bipartisan-infrastructure-investment-and-jobs-act/) include bold, historic, and transformational investments to strengthen our nation's resilience to climate change and extreme weather events, including historic investments in green and resilient housing.
Today, HUD, alongside more than 20 major federal agencies, is making available its climate adaptation and resilience plan. Highlights from HUD's plan include:
Updating climate risk data and research. HUD will update its policies and operations to create a more climate-resilient system. As a first step, the Department will collect building-level data across HUD programs to map existing climate risks and environmental justice concerns. This will help inform the Department on how to best address climate impacts and protect HUD-assisted assets and their occupants, with a focus on underserved communities. HUD's Office of Policy Development and Research will work to assess the effectiveness of current building efficiency codes and recovery programs and identify resilience best practices that the agency can adopt to promote investments in climate resilience. Reducing climate-related financial risks in mortgage financing. HUD is collaborating with the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Agriculture to consider approaches to better integrate climate-related financial risk into underwriting standards, loan terms and conditions, and asset management and servicing procedures (per EO 14030). HUD is also exploring market strategies to incentivize both energy and water efficiency and climate-resilient building practices. HUD recognizes these steps as critical to ensuring the best use of taxpayer dollars in response to changing climatic conditions. Strengthening disaster recovery and resilience. The greatest asset to our country is our people, and HUD recognizes the need to better protect America's communities from the impacts of climate change. HUD will update Disaster Recovery and Mitigation grant requirements to promote resilience and environmental justice, ensuring that communities recovering from disasters are more resilient in the future. HUD will also strengthen its floodplain management regulations to focus on increasing flood resilience, promoting environmental justice, improving fiscal security, and minimizing adverse impacts to the beneficial functions of floodplains and wetlands. Building a more equitable future. Climate change and its impacts exacerbate existing health and socioeconomic inequities, placing certain populations at particular risk. Addressing environmental inequities is at the core of HUD's mission to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities. HUD will create spaces for mutual learning around climate change, its impacts, and environmental justice issues impacting low-income, communities of color, tribal communities, individuals with disabilities, and other protected classes. Identifying leadership and accountability. For the first time, agencies have tasked senior leadership with ensuring steady progress on agency-wide adaptation and resilience efforts. HUD has established an internal Climate and Environmental Justice Council with representation at the Assistant Secretary level and led by HUD's Senior Advisor for Climate Change with support from the Office of Environment and Energy. The Climate and Environmental Justice Council will manage the implementation and monitoring of the climate adaptation plan and is responsible for the long-term integration of climate and environmental justice into HUD's programs and operations.

10/07/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-169.cfm,HUD Approves Agreement Between Owners of Tucson Apartment Complex and Same-Sex Couple Resolving Claims of Housing Discrimination,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has approved a Conciliation Agreement between the owners of an apartment complex in Tucson, AZ, the city of Tucson, and a same-sex African-American couple residing at the complex, resolving allegations that the owners and manager of the complex discriminated on the basis of sex and race when they failed to address the couple's complaints of neighbor harassment, which included physical intimidation and disparaging statements being made about the couple's race and sexual orientation. The owners also retaliated against the couple for complaining about the harassment. Read the Agreement.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination based on race and sex, which includes discrimination because of sexual orientation. The Act also prohibits housing providers from failing to take prompt actions to correct and end discriminatory harassment by other tenants where the housing provider knew or should have known if the discrimination.
""No one should be subjected to malicious treatment, the threat of physical harm, or any type of discrimination in the place they call home,"" said Demetria McCain, HUD's Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue working hard to ensure that housing providers meet their obligation to provide safe environments for their residents, regardless of their race or sexual orientation.""
The case came to HUD's attention when an African-American same-sex couple filed a complaint alleging that a neighbor was harassing them, including throwing rocks and yelling racial and sexual slurs and insults. In addition, the couple claimed that the property manager retaliated against them for complaining about the harassment by transferring them to a unit that contained mold and had other deficiencies.
Under the Agreement, the housing providers will pay $15,000 to the couple, create a tracking system for all reports of harassment and respond in a timely manner, and provide fair housing training for their employees.
People who believe they have experienced housing discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 877-8339 (Relay). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to hud.gov/fairhousing."
10/08/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-170.cfm,"Alabama Housing Providers Accused of Age, Disability, and Familial Status Discrimination Agree to Pay $20,000 to Resolve HUD Complaint","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has signed a Conciliation Agreement/Voluntary Compliance Agreement with Hollyhand Companies, Inc., and The Village at Meadowview, LTD, the owners of a HUD-subsidized community in Fairhope, Alabama. The agreement resolves allegations and a HUD investigation into whether the owners' policy prohibiting visitors under the age of 12 due to COVID-19 was discriminatory. Read the Agreement.
The case came to HUD's attention when a resident filed a complaint alleging that the owners of The Village at Meadowview discriminated against her. The resident, who had been providing childcare for her grandchildren, was allegedly told that she could no longer do so because it violated the owners' policy, instituted due to COVID-19, prohibiting visitors to the property under the age of 12. HUD also engaged in a compliance review to assess whether the owners had adopted an impermissible age distinction in their HUD-assisted programs or activities.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from making housing unavailable and imposing discriminatory terms or conditions based on a person's actual or perceived disability (including the perception that they are unsafe to associate with because of fear they may spread contagious disease) or their familial status, or retaliating against a person for exercising their fair housing rights. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504) prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by recipients of federal financial assistance. In addition, the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 prohibits discrimination on the basis of age in programs or activities receiving federal financial assistance.
""While housing providers can certainly take reasonable precautions to protect their residents from COVID-19, such as requiring residents and visitors to wear masks or maintain social distancing in public areas of an apartment building, they may not impose blanket prohibitions on any visits from children no matter what precautions are taken, thus keeping residents from visiting with family and friends in their own homes,"" said Demetria McCain, HUD's Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""As the nation continues to recover from the pandemic, HUD remains committed to protecting the rights of individuals and families when their fair housing rights are violated.""
Under the Agreement, the owners of The Village at Meadowview will pay the resident $20,000 and rescind their policy prohibiting visitors to the property who are under the age of 12, provide residents with notice of the rescission, and remove playground signage targeting anyone on the basis of age. The owners will also: implement revised visitation policies across all of their federally-funded properties; implement a non-discrimination policy at The Village at Meadowview and across their federally-funded properties; and undergo annual training for their management staff on how to comply with the Fair Housing Act, Section 504, and the Age Discrimination Act.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 877-8339 (Relay). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to hud.gov/fairhousing."

10/13/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-172.cfm,HUD Awards Over $15 Million in Research Grants to Reduce Housing-Related Health Hazards and Improve Energy Efficiency,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today awarded $15.7 million to 18 universities, public health, and housing organizations to conduct housing-related hazard and energy efficiency research studies. Provided through HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes (OLHCHH), the research grants aim to identify and improve methods for detecting and controlling lead and other housing-related health and safety hazards and will incorporate weatherization into residential lead and healthy homes interventions.
Providing funds for these studies and demonstrations is extremely important for developing knowledge that helps to create and sustain new and existing housing that supports the health of residents, especially populations at higher risk of being affected by home health hazards, such as young children and seniors.
""A home is a determinant of health, and today, too many homes are plagued with lead-based paint hazards, which disproportionality impact communities of color. HUD is committed addressing this issue and doing so in a way that places environmental justice and equity at the center of our efforts,"" said Matthew Ammon, Director of the Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes. ""Supporting research and demonstrations on housing-related health hazards is the basis for creating and maintaining homes that support the health of occupants and improve energy efficiency.""
HUD estimates that approximately 24 million older homes in the U.S. still have significant lead-based paint hazards, to date. While most public housing has already undergone abatement, there are still some properties where lead-based paint remains, and where hazards have redeveloped. HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes promotes state and local efforts to eliminate dangerous lead-paint and other housing-related health and safety hazards from homes of lower-income families, stimulate private sector investment in controlling these hazards, support cutting-edge research on methods for assessing and controlling housing-related health and safety hazards, and educate the public about the dangers of hazards in the home.
HUD's Lead and Healthy Homes Technical Studies Grant Program is awarding research grants to the following universities, public health, and housing organizations to identify and clean up lead hazards in their properties:
2021 Lead Technical Studies Grant Awards
Kansas
Kansas State University will be awarded $700,000 to measure the effectiveness of soil treatments (such as using phosphorus, iron, and exceptional quality biosolids) to reduce the hazard of lead exposure in urban soils. The target population is young children in Kansas City's urban core, where some lead poisoning rates exceed nine times the national average. Study objectives include: 1) identify improved, cost-effective protocols to manage commonly elevated urban soil lead; 2) build community capacity to use these protocols where they are most needed to prevent children having elevated blood lead levels; and 3) determine the efficacy of mitigation. Partners include City of Kansas City, Missouri; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; and Children's Mercy Hospital.
Maryland
National Center for Healthy Housing (NCHH) will be awarded $699,696. Working with the Lead and Environmental Hazards Association, the NCHH will first establish a database standard for the collection of high-quality paint and dust lead data, and then assemble a dataset of existing lead evaluation reports of adequate size to answer questions such as the relative risk of deteriorated LBP on various housing components. This information is expected to help improve lead hazard control policy and practice in the US. In addition, the study will demonstrate the feasibility of creating a privately sourced, lead hazard tracking dataset, similar in concept to the CDC's national tracking system for radon.
QuanTech, Inc. will be awarded $648,549 to test the new EPA floor clearance standard for efficacy. The study objectives are: 1) determine the efficacy of a single wipe, 1 square foot floor sample for detection of clearance failures at the new level; 2) determine the efficacy of the (""composited"") four-wipe, 4 square foot floor sample, as shown in an existing American Society for Testing and Materials standard for detection of clearance failures at the new level; and 3) determine the efficacy of EPA's cleaning verification for detection of clearance failures at the new level.
Michigan
Michigan State University will be awarded $699,264 to work with the Lansing Housing Commission and the Ingham County Health Department to assess the effectiveness of portable air filtration (PAF) for mitigating lead dust exposures and reducing childhood blood lead levels in older housing. Specific objectives include: (1) assess reduction of lead dust exposures; (2) assess reduction of childhood blood-lead levels; and (3) develop evidence-based exposure reduction guidance for wider public use of PAF. Positive results would form part of the evidence base required to promote wide-scale PAF implementation. This is particularly important for households that lack the resources to promptly remove lead-based paint hazards by other methods.
Michigan Technological University will be awarded $699,916 for a laboratory and field study to: (1) prescribe the most appropriate, low-cost lead-immobilization technique for contaminated soils of variable physical and chemical properties; (2) correlate standard laboratory-based measurements of the potential uptake of lead from soil following incidental ingestion with measurements made using a novel approach that uses human cell lines, which may provide more realistic risk numbers; and (3) predict blood lead levels and model human health risk for exposure to lead-contaminated soils with and without chemical amendments. This new knowledge is intended to help practitioners select site-appropriate, ecologically, and economically sustainable lead immobilization methods for remediation of residential soils.
New York
The Research Foundation for SUNY on behalf of the University at Buffalo will be awarded $659,499 to partner with the City of Buffalo and Grassroot Gardens of Western New York, a community gardening organization, to test the efficacy of dried mycelium - the root structure of mushrooms - to remove lead from soils in Buffalo. The study aims to: 1) investigate the mechanisms through which mycelium removes lead from soil; 2) test the efficacy of soil remediation via dried mycelium at varying soil pH levels and lead concentrations; 3) deliver educational programming on the risks of lead-contaminated soils and risk reduction; and 4) conduct a policy analysis and explore end-user perceptions and acceptability to inform future implementation efforts. If successful, this project will assess the feasibility of using this approach to remove lead from contaminated soils and broaden the range of educational materials on risks related to contaminated soils.
2021 Healthy Homes Technical Studies Grant Awards
California
Berkeley Air Monitoring Group, Inc. will be awarded $886,448 to assess the effect of the California Public Utilities Commission's program to replace gas and biomass-fueled appliances with electric appliances in the homes of 75 low-income households in California's San Joaquin Valley compared to 75 homes that do not receive the replacement appliances. The impact on indoor air quality will be assessed by comparing average daily indoor concentrations of common indoor air pollutants in the study homes. Researchers will also characterize and quantify impacts of key variables on indoor pollutant concentrations, such as use of venting hoods, air exchange rates, and outdoor air pollution. Another study goal is to evaluate the impact of a smart, low-cost air filtration unit on average indoor concentrations of airborne particles, especially during wildfire smoke events.
Iowa
University of Iowa will be awarded $700,000 to study data-based tools and implementation practices to assess drinking water as a potential contributor of lead exposure. The study objectives are to: (1) build an assessment tool using data from Flint, MI, such as a water lead risk score, to identify Flint homes that had a high risk of water-lead contamination; (2) adapt and generalize the water lead risk assessment tool to be more widely applicable to other communities; and (3) partner with public health agencies and grantees of HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes to further validate and promote using the water lead assessment tool to identify high-risk homes and residents, connect them to lead mitigation and public health promotion resources, and provide guidance on possible water-based intervention strategies. The second phase of the study will involve testing the tool using housing data in Iowa.
Maryland
National Center for Healthy Housing will be awarded $1,000,000 to study the premise that energy efficient ""Passive House"" multifamily design in affordable housing offers two elements that should result in lower airborne fine particulate matter levels in these homes compared to those in conventionally built multifamily homes: 1) a very tight building envelope that will reduce infiltration of these outdoor particulates and 2) the use of a continuously running balanced energy recovery ventilator with a high efficiency filter to reduce indoor levels of these particulates matter. The researchers will compare the levels of several pollutants and environmental conditions between the two groups.
Massachusetts
President and Fellows of Harvard College will be awarded $1,000,000 to better understand how sensors and educational models can be used to promote individual actions to address indoor environmental hazards by conducting a randomized control trial in the community of Dorchester in Boston, MA. The study will use a combination of real-time in-home monitors and exposure assessment methods to estimate indoor exposures to multiple chemical contaminants. The assessments will be conducted across different groups using different levels of educational models. Partnering with Silent Spring Institute, Harvard will address the following three objectives: 1) assess whether air pollutant monitors with real-time feedback alter behaviors to improve indoor air quality; 2) assess whether different models of participant education along with real-time feedback alters behaviors to further improve indoor air quality; and 3) assess whether participant education, including use of a smartphone app, alters behaviors affecting levels of specific contaminants.
North Carolina
Duke University will be awarded $1,000,000 to evaluate new approaches to quantify and reduce chemical exposures from common building materials, with an emphasis on plastic additives, pesticides, flame retardants, and lead. The objective of this project is to develop methods to quantify and reduce chemical exposures from the home environment using approaches that are adaptable and customizable to individuals and households. The study will: 1) advance a new wearable passive sampling device to assess personal exposures to metals and organic compounds; 2) identify the types of building materials and housing characteristics associated with higher levels of exposure; and 3) assess the effectiveness of robotic vacuuming for reducing exposure to a range of indoor contaminants that pose health risks.
Oklahoma
The University of Tulsa will be awarded $999,831 to further develop the mold classification tool (a DNA-based/machine learning approach for classifying the dampness/mold status of a building based on analysis of mold in settled dust samples) into a broadly applicable tool for home mold inspection and assessment of remediation effectiveness. The study has three objectives; 1) determine if the tool accurately tracks the return of a home's fungal condition from water-damaged/moldy to normal after thorough, standardized remediation has been conducted; 2) explore associations between tool scores with quantitative metrics of observable dampness and moldiness previously correlated with health; and 3) collect pilot data for planning a future study linking successful mold remediation (assessed by the tool) and improved health among asthmatic children.
Tennessee
Three3 Inc. will be awarded $999,002 to address the gap between what is known about how weatherization and healthy homes interventions affect indoor environment quality and observed variations in asthma outcomes following interventions. A second objective is to determine whether easily installable air purifiers and box fans with medium-efficiency filters can appreciably improve indoor air quality in both weatherized and un-weatherized homes of low-income families and if these changes impact asthma outcomes. The project will draw from a sample of individuals with active asthma already identified through an evaluation of the Tennessee Valley Authority's income-eligible weatherization program, Home Uplift.

10/25/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-174.cfm,HUD Reaches Settlement with Arizona Housing Providers Resolving Claims of National Origin Discrimination,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has reached a Conciliation Agreement/Voluntary Compliance Agreement with MGM Investment Company, the owner of Roosevelt Plaza Apartments in Phoenix, Arizona, as well as its property manager, resolving allegations that they violated the Fair Housing Act and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 when they failed to provide adequate language services for a resident with limited English proficiency (LEP). Roosevelt Plaza Apartments is a recipient of HUD funding. Read the Agreement.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from discriminating against persons because of national origin. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of national origin by recipients of federal financial assistance and requires such recipients to take reasonable steps to ensure that LEP persons have meaningful access to language services.
""Having access to important information related to federally-financed housing, such as details about application procedures and the terms of lease agreements, shouldn't depend on being fluent in English,"" said Demetria McCain, HUD's Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Title VI requires housing providers to make this information available to all applicants and tenants, regardless of what language they speak, and HUD is committed to ensuring that they meet that obligation.""
The case came to HUD's attention when a woman from Chad, who has limited English proficiency, filed a complaint alleging that the owner and manager of Roosevelt Plaza Apartments, where she and her daughter live, failed to provide her with the language services she needed to make informed decisions about her housing. The woman also alleged that respondents insisted that she sign English-language housing documents when she cannot adequately speak or read English.
Under the Agreement, MGM Investment Company will pay the woman $1,000 and each household with limited English proficiency $500, up to a total compensation of $34,000; provide interpretation services; ensure that signage in English, Somali, Arabic, Kinyarwanda, Tigrinya, and Spanish stating that interpretation services are available to current and prospective residents, free of charge, is posted at the entrances to the property; develop and implement a language access plan to provide for translated documents; and have its employees attend fair housing training.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 877-8339 (Relay). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to hud.gov/fairhousing."

WASHINGTON, D.C. - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today held a virtual event with Tribal leaders, housing practitioners, and members of Congress to recognize the 25th anniversary of the passage of the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 (NAHASDA). The landmark legislation bolstered Tribal Self-Determination and restructured how the federal government works with Tribes to address the housing and infrastructure needs in Indian Country. President Biden and Secretary Fudge have committed to engaging with Tribal Nations to address the housing crisis on Tribal lands and have called for historic funding for Tribal Nations in the Build Back Better plan. Deputy Secretary Adrianne Todman delivered a keynote address commemorating the anniversary and reiterating the Biden-Harris Administration's commitment to continued collaboration with Tribal Nations.
""The lasting legacy of NAHASDA is helping Tribes meet their communities' housing needs with flexible resources and self-determination,"" said Deputy Secretary Todman. ""As we celebrate this 25th anniversary, we also look forward to the immense progress we can make in the next 25 years in partnership with Tribal communities.""
Through NAHASDA funding, Tribal communities construct and rehabilitate affordable housing for low-income Native American families, operate and modernize existing housing, provide rental and mortgage assistance, develop critical housing-related infrastructure, provide essential services to disabled and elderly Native Americans, support Native Veterans, and much more. The event featured a panel discussion with leaders from Tribal Nations, including Tlingit and Haida, Ohkay Owingeh, and Ho-Chunk Nation.
""The importance of self-determination cannot be overstated,"" said Chickasaw Nation Governor Bill Anoatubby about the enduring impact of NAHASDA. ""Passage of NAHASDA two-and-a-half decades ago was a tremendous step forward in fulfilling our self-determination and our mission.""
Current and former members of Congress also participated, including former Congressman Rick Lazio, who first introduced NAHASDA in 1996, and Senators Brian Schatz and Lisa Murkowski, the current Chair and Vice Chair of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs.
""Since it was first signed into law in 1996, NAHASDA has provided billions in federal dollars to Tribes and Native communities in Hawaii and across the country,"" said Chair Brian Schatz. ""Our bill continues this bipartisan tradition and extends NAHASDA for another decade, giving Native communities the resources they need to help more Native families find safe, affordable housing.""
""Access to safe and affordable housing is an essential aspect to healthy families and communities. NAHASDA has allowed Tribal Housing Authorities to achieve economic self-sufficiency and self-determination and has led to safer, more affordable housing for Native people across our nation. I am glad to see so many voices from Indian country included in today's event including Jackie Pata, the CEO of Tlingit and Haida Regional Housing Authority,"" said Vice Chair Lisa Murkowski.

EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take three months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, six months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2 percent) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percentage change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percentage changes are 90 percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percentage changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised 3 percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau's website (www.census.gov/construction/nrs/how_the_data_are_collected/index.html)."
10/28/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-178.cfm,HUD Applauds Team Awarded Coveted 2021 Service to America Medal,"WASHINGTON - A group of U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) employees on Thursday were awarded 2021 Samuel J. Heyman Service to America Medals (Sammies). Michelle Daniels, Charles D. Eldridge, Ryan E.

Daniels, Eldridge, Jones, and the Foster Youth to Independence Team are the recipients of this year's Management Excellence Medal. The team advocated for, developed, implemented, and now run an innovative program that provides 18- to 24-year-olds aging out of foster care with rental assistance and other supportive services so they can work toward their educational and employment goals and reach self-sufficiency. The Foster Youth to Independence Initiative fills a longstanding gap in the social safety net. The Management Excellence Medal recognizes a significant accomplishment in efficient, effective, and results-oriented government.

""It is with great pleasure that our Department applauds the Foster Youth to Independence Team for their innovation, accomplishments, and public service,"" said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""Every young person deserves the opportunity to live with stability and hope—and the Foster Youth to Independence Team has done tremendous work to make that a reality for young people who are aging out of foster care by providing them with the support they need to succeed. I commend our colleagues, Michelle Daniels, Charles Eldridge, Ryan Jones, and the entire team, for their dedication and hard work.""
The Sammies, commonly referred to as the ""Oscars"" of government service, is one of the most prestigious recognitions in federal service. This year marks the 20th anniversary of the creation of the Sammies program, which recognizes innovation and leadership in the federal government.
Joining the Foster Youth to Independence Team as 2021 Sammies honorees, are those who worked to include addressing racial disparities in the COVID-19 response, cracking down on the importation of goods made overseas by forced labor and establishing a process that has accelerated America's digital revolution and brought billions of dollars to the U.S. Treasury.
""This year's winners brilliantly showcase how exceptional public servants are leading the efforts to solve many of our nation's greatest challenges,"" said Max Stier, president and CEO of the Partnership for Public Service. ""It is no understatement to say that the 2021 Service to America Medal honorees have changed the world with their accomplishments, and the depth and breadth of their impact is immeasurable.

10/29/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-180.cfm,Secretary Marcia L. Fudge and Cleveland Clinic CEO Dr. Tom Mihaljevic Discuss Solutions to National Lead Crisis,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Marcia L. Fudge this week hosted Cleveland Clinic President and CEO Dr. Tom Mihaljevic for a conversation on solutions for solving the nation's lead poisoning crisis. Secretary Fudge and Dr. Mihaljevic talked about the importance of raising awareness of the harmful and long-term detrimental effects of lead exposure to children, and the disproportional prevalence of elevated blood levels in underserved and communities of color.
""We're doing our part to make sure that we put people in safer places, and you will find over time, we can show that children that live in HUD properties or those associated with HUD have lower levels because of our inspections and because of our demanding that these issues are taken care of as quickly as possible,"" said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""We know that this problem, in particular, is a racial equity issue. We know that it affects Black and brown people and poor people so severely that if we don't raise our voices, no one will. It is so isolated. But as you said, it is also so urgent. We cannot afford to lose thousands and thousands of young people to something that we can stop.""
""What I believe that needs to happen first and foremost is to raise awareness,"" said Dr. Tom Mihaljevic. ""We're seeing hundreds of thousands of children in the most disadvantageous communities being essentially deprived of the opportunity to lead a normal and productive life by no fault of their own. We have to recognize that we as a country cannot stand for that. Raising an awareness that this is a problem that we know we can take care of, that this is a problem that this is important, is the first and probably most important step that we need to make.""
The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to ensuring all Americans have access to a safe, healthy, affordable home. For the first time HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes (OLHCHH) this year made available over $450 million for programs to assess and remediate lead-based paint and other housing-related health hazards, to make safety and functional home modifications and repairs to meet the needs of low-income elderly homeowners, to develop new and improved methods to identify and control residential health hazards, and to mitigate health and safety hazards and make improvements in energy efficiency and comfort. This funding will enable jurisdictions to mitigate the impacts of unhealthy housing, preserve affordable housing, enable older adults to stay in their homes, and to ensure that future generations can reach their full potential.
Today, about 3.3 million U.S. families with a child under age 6 years live in a home with one or more conditions that can expose their child to lead-based paint hazards. Of these homes with a child under age 6, about 2.1 million house families with low income. The critical funding investments, in addition to local partnerships and infrastructure created to make housing units lead-safe will have long lasting impacts. These investments will dramatically shift efforts to identify and eliminate lead hazards before a child is exposed to them.
Below are some video clip highlights of their conversation:
HUD's Response to Lead Poisoning (https://youtu.be/ahbsr2VZYmM)
HUD has protected more than 200,000 at-risk young children in communities across our nation by awarding grants to health and housing agencies to fix health and safety hazards present in their families' homes. HUD also relies on public-private partnerships to pour essential funding for communities most in need. President Biden's Build Back Better agenda is a critical step in being able to create safer, healthier homes in every corner of our nation.

Lead is a Racial Equity Issue (https://youtu.be/zVWxXwBiARc)
It is well-documented that people of color and children in poor households are at a markedly higher risk of lead exposure than are majority-white communities due to barriers to accessing safe and affordable housing. HUD's mission to advance racial equity includes ensuring every family has access to a safe and healthy, lead-free home.

Communities Disproportionately Impacted by Lead (https://youtu.be/THWrG_oYQmY)
We know too that many communities that have experienced historic disinvestment in school systems, recreation systems, and housing are struggling to keep up with the threat of lead. In particular, poor children and children of color are more frequently introduced to situations where they are prone to lead exposure because of the wilting infrastructure in their neighborhoods and towns. In her conversation with Dr. Mihaljevic, Secretary Fudge reiterates the importance of HUD's collaboration with local systems in addressing lead poisoning.

11/01/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-181.cfm,"HUD Allocates More than $2 Billion to Advance Equitable Disaster Recovery, Build Climate Change Resilience","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today announced the allocation of more than $2 billion ($2,040,617,000) in CDBG-Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) and CDBG-Mitigation (CDBG-MIT) funds appropriated in the continuing resolution, the Extending Government Funding and Delivering Emergency Assistance Act (PL 117-43 (www.congress.gov/117/plaws/publ43/PLAW-117publ43.pdf); the Act), signed into law on September 30, 2021. These allocations underscore HUD and the Biden-Harris Administration's commitment to equitably improving the nation's disaster recovery and building long-term, inclusive resilience to meet the impacts of climate change, particularly for historically marginalized communities.
This allocation is being made to 10 states covering 15 separate major disasters that occurred calendar year 2020. The states, allocations, and disasters covered are available below.
These funds will go to recover from and build resilience to natural disasters, including climate disasters, with a specific focus on low- and moderate-income populations. The funds are specified to be used for: ""disaster relief, long-term recovery, restoration of infrastructure and housing, economic revitalization, and mitigation, in the most impacted and distressed areas.""
""These disaster recovery and mitigation funds are essential to advancing the Biden-Harris Administration's climate and equity priorities by building long-term and inclusive resilience to the impacts of climate change, particularly for underserved and marginalized communities,"" said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""With these allocations, we are addressing climate justice in hard-hit communities that can now begin the process of building back better from disasters and improving long-term, equitable resilience to future impacts of climate change.""
These are the first CDBG-DR/MIT awards of the Biden-Harris Administration. Oregon and Michigan are receiving their first ever DR/MIT allocations.
PL 117-43 appropriated a total of $5 billion in CDBG-DR/MIT funds for major disasters that occurred in 2020 or 2021. Allocation of the remaining CDBG-DR/MIT funds will be made over the next few months to address unmet needs from disasters occurring in 2021, including Hurricane Ida.
Climate change poses a multitude of risks for communities across the country. This includes rising costs to maintain and repair damaged infrastructure from more frequent and extreme weather events and health and safety challenges to the communities across the country. Acting now to manage climate risk will increase the resilience of communities to wildfires, extreme heat, tropical storms, heavy rains, and other disasters made worse by a changing climate.
Equitable disaster recovery and resilience is a priority of HUD's newly published Climate Action Plan.
HUD's Climate Action Plan notes that the Department is committed to advancing the goals of Executive Order 13985, which requires HUD to allocate resources in a manner that equitably invests in underserved communities, especially communities of color. HUD is committed to taking actions to invest in climate resiliency to reinforce its mission of creating strong, sustainable, and inclusive communities with affordable homes for all.

Among the activities that will be conducted by the organizations is addressing discriminatory practices in underserved communities.
""Discriminatory policies have no place in a nation struggling to deal with the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic,"" said Demetria McCain, HUD's Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""The funds being provided today highlight HUD's commitment to supporting the efforts of our many partners working to combat unlawful practices that jeopardize a family's housing security.""
The funds, which are being awarded under FHIP's Private Enforcement Initiative (PEI) component, are the first ARP competitive grants in FHEO that focus directly on the unequal impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on communities of color, low-income communities, and other vulnerable populations. Specific activities that will be carried out include responding to housing inquiries, investigating fair housing complaints, conducting fair housing testing, providing legal assistance, conducting education and outreach, and covering costs associated with providing services related to the pandemic.

11/09/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-183.cfm,Federal Housing Administration Publishes Revised Title I Policies to Further Future Financing of Manufactured Homes,"WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) on Tuesday announced the publication of significantly revised and enhanced policies under its Single-Family Title I Manufactured Home Loan Program for lenders to provide loans for the financing of manufactured homes, including those titled as personal property, and the lots on which these homes will reside. The enhanced policies provide updated guidance that will make the program easier to understand and use for lenders, while providing expanded eligibility requirements for loan financing that are consistent with the criteria for income and property valuations used in real-estate mortgage financing.
""This nation is in an affordable housing crisis and manufactured housing will be a key part of the solution,"" said Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Housing and the Federal Housing Administration Lopa P. Kolluri. ""Our new and updated Title I policies will not only expand access to credit for borrowers seeking loans for quality and affordable personal property manufactured homes, but will also make it to easier for lenders to offer financing through the Title 1 program.""
FHA's new Title I policies have now been incorporated into the Single Family Housing Policy Handbook 4000.1. This is the first consolidation of policies for the Title I program in almost 40 years and removes the need for lenders to refer to more than 120 separate policy documents. With today's updates, Title I Manufactured Home Loan Program requirements now include features that remove financing barriers and expand access to credit, including:
Enhanced value determinations that use a sales comparison approach, allow for qualified FHA Roster Appraisers to perform valuations; Expanded allowable income sources for borrower qualification that are comparable to FHA's Title II mortgage insurance programs; and Additional flexibilities which include calculating student loan debt consistent with FHA's Title II mortgage insurance programs and allowing the use of gift funds from eligible sources.

In addition to Title I Manufactured Home Loan Program updates, today FHA also published updates to the requirements for its Title I Property Improvement Loan Program to make the requirements of this program consistent with current lending practices. The Title I Property Improvement Loan Program is designed to help homeowners finance improvements to improve the livability or utility of a property through a secured or unsecured loan.
Both the Title I Manufactured Home Loan Program and Title I Property Improvement Loan Program updates may be implemented by lenders immediately but must be implemented for loans closed on and after May 9, 2022.

11/09/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-184.cfm,HUD Awards $36 Million to Boost Local Economic Development and Affordable Housing Programs,"WASHINGTON - More than 250 communities across the country will be able to increase the economic impact of their local community development and affordable housing programs for low- and moderate-income persons through $36 million in ""capacity-building"" grants awarded by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The funds awarded will support three national organizations and are ultimately expected to produce approximately 8,000 units of affordable housing nationwide and stimulate nearly $150 million in total investment.
Three national groups were selected to distribute the funds to local initiatives that support affordable housing and community development - Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC); Enterprise Community Partners, Inc.; and Habitat for Humanity International.
""I am pleased to announce these funds to build affordable housing and make communities stronger,"" said HUD Deputy Secretary Adrianne Todman during a virtual press call announcing the awards. ""With this innovative pot of funds, we are building the capacity of local organizations to really solve the problems their communities are facing in the affordable housing and community development space. President Biden's Build Back Better framework, which makes the single largest and most comprehensive investment in affordable housing in U.S. history, will enhance our ability to benefit even more communities.""
""HUD's Section 4 Capacity Building Program plays a vital role in the work we do at Enterprise to make homes and communities places of pride, power, and belonging,"" said Enterprise Community Partners President and CEO Priscilla Almodovar. ""Section 4 grants enable nonprofits to better serve the unique needs of communities by providing them with flexible resources and training to develop affordable housing, support small businesses, and revitalize commercial corridors. This support for organizations to expand their services and help our nation rebuild from the pandemic is critical, particularly as the Administration and Congress work to provide historic levels of investment in housing and community development programs through the Build Back Better Act.""
""Section 4 is a direct investment in a more broadly shared prosperity,"" said Lisa Glover, interim LISC president and CEO. ""It builds the resiliency of our communities by strengthening local organizations that fuel affordable housing, strong businesses, health, education and jobs. It underpins more vibrant, more inclusive local economies, especially as we emerge from the pandemic, and it creates pathways to opportunity that would not otherwise exist. We're honored to receive this award and to work with HUD and our local partners to deploy this vital resource across the country.""
""With the supply of affordable housing at a historic low, these funds will help increase the supply of affordable housing where Habitat builds and ultimately benefit more families as they work to build and improve the places they call home,"" said Habitat for Humanity International Senior Vice President of U.S. & Canada Adrienne Goolsby. ""We are delighted to be selected to distribute this vital funding to local communities. The HUD grants are aimed at adding affordable housing units and support community development. With these funds, Habitat for Humanity will be able to do exactly that.""
These awards go to increasing technical and administrative support of projects that provide adequate housing, education, employment and shopping, safe streets, and transportation. Because HUD's capacity building grant program requires a minimum three-to-one private/public match, these grants will stimulate nearly $150 million in total investment.
The national groups awarded funding will work with community development corporations (CDCs) and community housing development organizations (CHDOS) to carry out community development and affordable housing activities. This partnership will help to rebuild and revitalize neighborhoods and improve the lives of residents by creating affordable housing opportunities and jobs through community and economic development activities that would not otherwise have occurred.
The following organizations will receive Section 4 funds (see individual descriptions below):
Additional Information on HUD's Fiscal Year 2020 Section 4 Grantees
Enterprise Community Partners will receive a Section 4 grant award in the amount of $14,253,912 with a 3 to 1 match commitment of $42,761,736. Enterprise's organizational structure is specifically designed to provide comprehensive support to CDCs and CHDOs with a full platform of capital investment products, including debt and equity, program development and technical assistance services, and research and advocacy.
Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC) will receive a Section 4 grant award in the amount of $13,647,363 with a 3 to 1 match commitment of $40,942,089. LISC focuses on effectively increasing CDC and CHDO capacity with Section4-funded resources ensuring that they will address needs at both the organizational level and the community level; as these organizations are strengthened internally, they are able to grow programs and investments externally to have broader and deeper community impact.
Habitat for Humanity International will receive a Section 4 grant award in the amount of $8,098,725 with a 3 to 1 match of $24,296,175. Habitat uses Section 4 funds to award their affiliates to build their capacity to effectively develop affordable housing in partnership with low-income families and individuals in their defined geographic service areas. Habitat CDCs' services include home construction, homeowner counseling, budget training, and, in many instances, housing renovation, housing rehabilitation, and general support of neighborhood revitalization efforts."

Our Department remains committed to ensuring all communities—especially those most impacted by non-inclusive policies and procedures—have a fair opportunity to secure housing for themselves and their families.""
The CFPB and federal courts have consistently found that the use of name-only matching procedures—when a consumer reporting company uses only first and last name to determine whether a particular item of information relates to a particular consumer, without using other personally identifying information such as address, date of birth, or Social Security number—fails to ensure maximum possible accuracy of consumer information.
False-identity matching harms a qualified rental applicant when they have the same name as another individual who has negative credit history. Specifically, the CFPB affirmed that the practice of matching consumer records solely through the matching of names is illegal under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Hispanic, Black, and Asian rental applicants are at greater risk of denial because surnames of people from these communities tend to be less diverse than non-Hispanic whites.

11/10/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-186.cfm,HUD Announces $74 Million to Deliver Equitable COVID-19 Relief to Tribal Communities,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced more than $73.9 million in Indian Community Block Grant-American Rescue Plan (ICDBG-ARP) grants to 68 Tribal communities. The announcement, made during a press call with HUD Deputy Secretary Adrianne Todman, underscores the Biden-Harris Administration's commitment to delivering equitable COVID-19 relief to Tribal communities.
A breakdown of the awards by recipient is available here.
These funds to Tribes will help protect the health and safety of their communities, particularly low-and moderate-income individuals and families, by expanding access to safe housing, a suitable living environment, and economic opportunities.
""HUD understands its responsibility to Indigenous communities. These awards will provide critical funding to Tribes to help them prevent, prepare for, and respond to COVID-19,"" said HUD Deputy Secretary Adrianne Todman. ""These awards reiterate the Biden-Harris Administration's commitment to working together to meet urgent housing and community development needs in Tribal communities.""
This announcement comes before the White House Tribal Nations Summit on November 15 and 16. This summit will build upon President Biden's commitment to strengthening the federal relationship with Tribal Nations and fulfills a commitment to reinstate the Tribal Nations Conference that was held annually throughout the Obama-Biden Administration. The Summit will provide Tribal leaders from 574 federally recognized Tribes the opportunity to engage and consult directly with the President and members of the Cabinet, including HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge.
HUD and the Biden-Harris Administration have made delivering equitable COVID-19 relief to Tribal communities a priority. The American Rescue Plan Act provides $750 million dollars in HUD resources to Indian Country to support the continued fight against COVID-19. Earlier this year, HUD made a historic $450 million investment in Indian Housing Block Grants (IHBG) to Indian tribes across the country to respond to COVID-19. The Department also invested $5 million in COVID-19 relief for Native Hawaiians.
HUD and the Biden-Harris Administration remain committed to meeting and prioritizing the needs of Native communities."
11/15/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-187.cfm,FHA Releases 2021 Annual Financial Report to Congress,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today released its fiscal year (FY) 2021 report to Congress on the financial health of the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund. In addition to its emphasis on delivering relief options to homeowners financially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, FHA continued to deliver on its mission of enabling homeownership for first-time and low- and moderate-income, and households of color.
The MMI Fund supports FHA's Single Family mortgage insurance programs, including all forward mortgage purchase and refinance transactions, as well as mortgages insured under the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) reverse mortgage program. The report illustrates that the MMI Fund increased its overall Capital Ratio, ending the fiscal year at 8.03 percent, an increase of 1.93 percentage points over the previous fiscal year. For the first time since 2015, the HECM reverse mortgage program has a strong positive ratio, primarily due to strong national home price appreciation. As the recovery from the pandemic continues, the Fund remains well positioned to withstand future economic events and endure the outcomes from the pandemic induced delinquencies that remain in forbearance or are seriously delinquent.
""The strength of the fund is a promising sign and solidifies the important role FHA fulfills in making homeownership a reality for first-time homebuyers and those with lower incomes."" said U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""This year, our Administration took unprecedented steps to deliver relief to those devastated by the pandemic. Managing the strong fiscal health and performance of the FHA program is a top priority, and I am encouraged to see the MMI Fund remain resilient through the events of the past year. Looking ahead, we will ensure FHA is well positioned to provide broad and equitable access to homeownership, especially for those who have been historically underserved in the mortgage market.""
KEY HIGHLIGHTS FROM FHA'S FY 2021 MMI FUND ANNUAL REPORT
As of September 30, 2021, FHA had active insurance on more than 7.8 million single family forward and reverse mortgages, with a total unpaid principal balance of more than $1.2 trillion.
The percentage of first-time homebuyers using FHA insurance reached a new high of 84.61 percent of total FHA forward mortgage purchase endorsements in FY 2021. The share of mortgages insured by FHA to minority borrowers reached almost 42 percent of all FHA forward mortgage insurance endorsements in FY 2021. FHA served double the percentage of Black and Hispanic borrowers when compared to those served through mortgage originations by the rest of the housing market this past fiscal year.
The overall Capital Ratio for FY 2021 was 8.03 percent, an increase of 1.93 percentage points over FY 2020's 6.10 percent capital ratio. The Capital Ratio is one indicator of the MMI Fund's financial health and includes both the FHA-insured single family forward and reverse mortgage portfolios.
FHA's forward mortgage portfolio achieved solid performance with a stand-alone capital ratio of 7.99 percent as of September 30, 2021, an increase of 1.68 percentage points over the previous year.
The Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) reverse mortgage portfolio saw a significant improvement in its valuation. It has a stand-alone capital ratio of 6.08 percent as of September 30, 2021, compared to a negative 0.78 percent capital ratio from the previous year.
The Annual Report to Congress Regarding the Financial Status of the Federal Housing Administration Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund for fiscal year 2021, and the fiscal year 2021 actuarial reviews of the forward and Home Equity Conversion Mortgage portfolios are available on HUD.gov."
11/16/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-188.cfm,"HUD Awards More than $5.3 Million in Disaster Relief and Recovery Funds to the City of Lake Charles, Louisiana","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced the awarding of more than $5.3 million to Lake Charles, Louisiana to assist in the city's recovery from Hurricanes Delta and Laura. The new Community Development Block Grant Declared Disaster Recovery Fund (DDR) money will help Lake Charles communities rebuild and become more resilient to future disasters.
""Today's award announcement will help Lake Charles continue its efforts to rebuild and restore the fabric of so many neighborhoods still reeling from the events of 2020,"" said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""HUD understands the devastation Louisiana has faced from disasters in recent years. That is why we are committed to ensuring that the state and impacted communities have robust resources to meet remaining housing needs and build inclusive resilience to future disasters and the impacts of climate change by investing in measures that reduce risks to people and property in underserved communities.""
The $5,355,592 in funding will help Lake Charles recover from a series of disasters in 2020 - most notably, Hurricanes Laura and Delta, which delivered a one-two punch to the city in August and October of that year.
On August 28, 2020, FEMA issued a major disaster declaration that included Lake Charles and Calcasieu Parish for Hurricane Laura. Less than two months later, Lake Charles was again in the eye of the storm as Hurricane Delta came ashore. This double strike has impaired the ability of Lake Charles residents to recover, especially those low- and moderate-income individuals and families most impacted by the hurricanes.
HUD's analysis of FEMA registrant data shows that over 14,000 homes in Lake Charles received damage due to Hurricane Delta alone, with over 4,000 of these homes still having serious unmet needs.
Early this month, HUD announced the allocation of more than $2 billion ($2,040,617,000) in additional disaster recovery funds appropriated in the continuing resolution, the Extending Government Funding and Delivering Emergency Assistance Act (PL 117-43; the Act), signed into law on September 30, 2021. Louisiana was among the ten states that received allocations for 2020 disasters. PL 117-43 appropriated a total of $5 billion in funds for major disasters that occurred in 2020 or 2021. Allocation of the remaining funds will be made over the next few months to address remaining unmet needs, including those that occurred in 2021, such as Hurricane Ida."
11/16/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-189.cfm,HUD Announces Formation of Tribal Intergovernmental Advisory Committee,"WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced the formation of the Tribal Intergovernmental Advisory Committee (TIAC), as part of the Biden-Harris Administrations commitment to engaging with Tribal Nations. The announcement comes as President Biden hosts the first White House Tribal Nations Summit since 2016, which will provide Tribal leaders from the 574 federally recognized Tribes the opportunity to engage and consult directly with the President and members of the Cabinet on a Nation-to-Nation basis. The first-of-its-kind advisory committee within HUD will bring together senior HUD officials and Tribal Leaders to ensure the needs of Tribes are being met in how HUD programs and designed and implemented.
""The creation of HUD's first Tribal Intergovernmental Advisory Committee demonstrates that HUD is firmly committed to fulfilling the federal government's trust responsibility"" said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""This is a historic step towards honoring and strengthening our special Nation-to-Nation relationship while ensuring that the federal government is working alongside Tribal leaders to identify housing solutions that make sense for Indian Country.""
The TIAC formalizes collaboration between HUD and Tribal Nations and will join Secretary Fudge, Deputy Secretary Adrianne Todman, various Assistant Secretaries within the Department, and Tribal leaders nominated to serve on the Committee. Today, HUD published a notice in the Federal Register to solicit input from Tribes on the structure of the TIAC and provide additional detail about the new Advisory Committee. In the coming months, HUD will solicit nominations for Tribal Leaders to serve on the TIAC.
The TIAC reflects President Biden and Secretary Fudge's commitment to addressing the nation's housing crisis, particularly for underserved communities, as underscored by the historic $1 billion in funding for Tribal Nations included in the Biden-Harris Administration's Build Back Better plan. Secretary Fudge has also made housing in Tribal communities a priority of HUD's new House America initiative, which in partnership with the White House and the US Interagency Council on Homelessness, brings together governors, mayors, Tribal leaders, and others to put America on the path to ending homelessness.
From the beginning of her tenure, Secretary Fudge has met with numerous Tribal leaders, including in a visit to the Catawba Indian Nation Reservation in South Carolina. She has personally committed to bringing more resources to addressing the housing and infrastructure needs of people living in Indian Country. Secretary Fudge also tasked the Department with taking action to fulfill the federal trust responsibility and strengthen relationships between the United States and Tribal Nations.
This fall, HUD Deputy Secretary Todman held a series of in-depth roundtable discussions with Tribal leaders and housing practitioners in all six regions defined by the Office of Native American Programs – Alaska, Southwest, Northwest, Northern Plains, Southern Plains, and Eastern Woodlands. She discussed the unique and complex issues facing Tribal communities with Tribal leaders and housing practitioners, the cost of construction to manifestations of homelessness in Tribal communities."
11/17/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-190.cfm,HUD Releases Agency Climate Action Plan,"WASHINGTON - As part of the Biden-Harris Administration's whole-of-government approach to confronting the climate crisis, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) released its Climate Action Plan, which details a comprehensive strategy to reduce the agency's energy and carbon footprint and put our nation's communities on the path to building more equitable, efficient, and sustainable housing infrastructure. On Thursday, Secretary Marcia L. Fudge joined world and business leaders virtually for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) in Glasgow, United Kingdom to announce HUD's plan and affirm the Administration's commitment to delivering climate justice by increasing the resilience of vulnerable communities, investing in green and resilient buildings, and creating good-paying jobs in new industries.
""We are in the midst of a global climate crisis and we have limited time to respond. HUD's Climate Action Plan will meet the urgency of this moment,"" said Secretary Fudge. ""The U.S. is leading the fight against climate change, and in Glasgow, we will set the example at home and around the world that HUD and the entire Biden-Harris Administration is committed to delivering climate justice in our communities.""
The Climate Action Plan was developed in response to President Biden's Executive Order on Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad (www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/27/executive-order-on-tackling-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad/). In keeping with the executive order, as well as the President's Justice40 Initiative (www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/01/27/fact-sheet-president-biden-takes-executive-actions-to-tackle-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad-create-jobs-and-restore-scientific-integrity-across-federal-government/) to advance environmental justice and racial equity, HUD will implement a broad approach to the climate crisis that reduces climate pollution; increases resilience to the impacts of climate change; protects public health; delivers environmental justice; and spurs well-paying union jobs and economic growth.
In order to implement and track the actions detailed in the Climate Action Plan, HUD has established the Climate and Environmental Justice Council comprised of Assistant Secretaries from across the agency. The Council will enable an all-hands-on-deck at HUD to deliver climate and environmental justice throughout the Department's work. Highlights from the Climate Action Plan include:
Cities and localities are on the front lines of the climate emergency, and low-income residents and people of color often bear more of the impact when climate-related disasters strike HUD, in partnership with local leaders, is announcing a suite of resources, support, and tools to help cities respond equitably the climate crisis. This includes a climate resilience toolkit, implementation models, peer-to-peer learning opportunities, stakeholder engagement with underserved communities, and direct support to a cohort of climate cities.

• Green Building and Electrification: In order to assist low-income households and communities of color, which are too often left out when it comes to advancing technology and green building, HUD will align building and substantial rehabilitation incentives and requirements, with energy efficiency and equitable decarbonization goals, including the requirement of new construction with new funds to achieve green building standards. HUD will also finalize rulemaking requiring strengthened minimum energy standards as required by statute. This will ensure that HUD-assisted households are not left behind as we shift to a low-carbon future. In addition, HUD is announcing a partnership with the Department of Energy's Better Climate Challenge. The Better CLIMATE Challenge is an extension of the Better Buildings Challenge. Three HUD partners (King County Housing Authority, Tenderloin Neighborhood Development Corporation, and Community Housing Partners) have joined this climate challenge and have pledged to reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions by 50% in 10 years.

11/18/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-191.cfm,"HUD Secretary Fudge and Governors Pierluisi, Edwards, Brown Discuss $2 Billion in Disaster Recovery and Resilience Funding Awards","WASHINGTON - U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Marcia L. Fudge, Puerto Rico Governor Pedro Pierluisi, Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards, and Oregon Governor Kate Brown held a virtual press call on Thursday, November 18, to discuss HUD's allocation of $2 billion in federal funding to advance equitable disaster recovery and build resilience to climate change.
These Community Development Block Grant-Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) funds, which include mitigation, will help communities recover from and build resilience to natural disasters, including climate disasters, with a specific focus on low- and moderate-income populations. These are the first CDBG-DR/MIT awards of the Biden-Harris Administration. This is the first time the state of Oregon has ever received a DR/MIT allocation.
""With these allocations, HUD and the Biden-Harris Administration are providing communities resources to Build Back Better from disasters and improve long-term, equitable resilience to future impacts of climate change."" said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""This is a top priority of the Administration and of this Department - and a core piece of HUD's newly published Climate Action Plan. HUD will continue to work with communities to ensure they have equitable access to disaster recovery and resilience to the impacts of climate change.""
""It is hard to understate what the $422 million the Biden-Harris Administration has allocated to Oregon for disaster recovery will mean for the families displaced by the Labor Day 2020 wildfires,"" said Oregon Governor Kate Brown. ""The inescapable truth of climate change is that the most vulnerable people are the ones hardest hit by natural disasters. Because of historic disparities and systemic inequities, people from Oregon's rural, low-income, and communities of color who lost their homes face the greatest barriers to rebuilding. Now, we will reconstruct and replace homes to support families who have been living displaced for over a year, expand access to affordable and fire-resilient housing, and support business recovery to help recover lost jobs.""
""The reconstruction of Puerto Rico has been at the top of my agenda since I assumed office,"" said the Governor of Puerto Rico, Pedro R. Pierluisi. ""The challenges our administration encountered stemmed from obstacles around access to recovery funding, which, thanks to the commitment of this Administration and Secretary Fudge's leadership, are now a thing of the past. We are now witnessing significant advances in the construction of new, resilient housing, community improvements, and sustainable development. There is still a lot of work to be done, but we are confident that with the support received from the Biden-Harris administration, we will achieve the strong Puerto Rico all our citizens deserve.""
""This allocation of recovery funding for 2020 hurricanes in Louisiana is a step in the right direction and very much appreciated, but I continue to advocate for the additional funding needed for a full recovery of Southwest Louisiana and the other impacted areas of the state, especially when it comes to housing,"" said Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards. ""I appreciate Secretary Fudge's continued support of Louisiana as we work to make the case for more funding. Rest assured that as soon as HUD publishes the regulations related to this funding, we will quickly submit Louisiana's action plan for investing these funds into recovery from the hurricanes that devastated our state more than a year ago. We have been working with the communities and leaders in Southwest Louisiana for months to develop a recovery plan that will put these funds to use quickly and effectively. And of course, we will also continue to make the case for the necessary federal recovery funding related to the catastrophic damages caused by Hurricane Ida this past August.""
Climate change poses a multitude of risks for communities across the country. This includes rising costs to maintain and repair damaged infrastructure from more frequent and extreme weather events and health and safety challenges. Acting now to manage climate risk will increase the resilience of communities to wildfires, extreme heat, tropical storms, heavy rains, and other disasters made worse by a changing climate.
Equitable disaster recovery and resilience is a priority of HUD's Climate Action Plan.
HUD's Climate Action Plan notes that the Department is committed to advancing the goals of Executive Order 13985, which requires HUD to allocate resources in a manner that equitably invests in underserved communities, especially communities of color. HUD is committed to taking actions to invest in climate resiliency to reinforce its mission of creating strong, sustainable, and inclusive communities with affordable homes for all."

11/23/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-193.cfm,HUD Awards $20 Million for Eviction Protection and Diversion,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) on Tuesday announced $20 million in inaugural grants from its Eviction Protection Grant Program, the first of its kind for the Department. These grants will be awarded to legal service providers to assist in providing legal assistance to low-income tenants at risk of or subject to eviction. The Eviction Protection Grant Program is part of HUD's continued work, as part of a whole of government approach, to support families recovering from the public health and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.
HUD has selected and offered grants to 10 organizations from across the country to support their ability to expand resolution options for clients at risk of eviction. Over 100 applications were submitted for consideration, making the grant selection process highly competitive.
""As families continue to feel the financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and local eviction moratoria expire, we must continue to do all that we can to prevent evictions and keep people housed,"" said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""Research shows that access to legal services and eviction diversion programs can help renters avoid eviction and the many harmful outcomes that come along with eviction actions. These programs can also benefit court systems and landlords by reducing eviction caseloads for local court systems and helping landlords access emergency rental assistance so they can maintain housing quality during these uncertain times. That is why our Department is proud to release an inaugural Eviction Protection Grant Program to ensure eviction protection services reach the people who need it most.""
The Eviction Protection Grant Program supports experienced legal service providers in providing legal assistance at no cost to low-income tenants at risk of or subject to eviction. Through HUD's Office of Policy Development and Research, the grants were made available to legal service providers serving or expanding services in areas with high rates of eviction or prospective evictions, including rural areas. This grant program plays an integral role in helping individuals and families, including people of color who are disproportionately represented among those evicted, people with limited English proficiency and people with disabilities, avoid eviction or minimize the disruption and damage caused by the eviction process.
HUD plans to award grants to the following non-profit legal services providers:

One of the leading interventions to prevent evictions is providing legal assistance to at-risk tenants. Research shows that legal representation helps tenants remain housed while also delivering financial savings to the jurisdictions. For example, a study (https://bmorerentersunited.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Baltimore-RTC-Report_FINAL_5.8.2020.pdf) in Baltimore found that an annual investment of $5.7 million in a right to counsel program in Baltimore would yield $35.6 million in benefits or costs avoided to the city and state. (Stout Risius Ross, LLC. May 8, 2020. The Economic Impact of an Eviction Right to Counsel in Baltimore City (https://bmorerentersunited.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Baltimore-RTC-Report_FINAL_5.8.2020.pdf)).
A right to counsel in eviction proceedings has consistently been found to significantly reduce evictions (Eviction Right to Counsel Resource Center (www.stout.com/en/services/transformative-change-consulting/eviction-right-to-counsel-resources)). A study in Minnesota found fully represented tenants win or settle their cases 96 percent of the time and clients receiving limited representation win or settle their cases 83 percent of the time. These figures compare with just 62 percent of tenants without any representation. Tenants with full representation were twice as likely to stay in their homes or got twice as much time to move, left court without an eviction record, and were four times less likely to use homeless shelters (Grundman & Kruger, 2018, Legal Representation in Evictions - Comparative Study (www.minnpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/2018-Eviction-Representation-Results-Study-with-logos.pdf)). An analysis of California's Shriver Housing Pilot Projects found clients with full representation were significantly less likely to end their cases by default (8 percent) than were self-represented defendants (26 percent) and on average had more days to move, were ordered less often to pay holdover damages, landlord attorney fees, and other costs (NPC Research, 2017)."

Sales of new single-family houses in October 2021 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 745,000. This is 0.4 percent (±21.1 percent)* above the revised September rate of 742,000 but is 23.1 percent (±15.1 percent) below the October 2020 estimate of 969,000.
Sales Price
The median sales price of new houses sold in October 2021 was $407,700 The average sales price was $477,800.
For Sale Inventory and Months' Supply
The seasonally adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of October was 389,000 This represents a supply of 6.3 months at the current sales rate.

EXPLANATORY NOTES
These statistics are estimated from sample surveys. They are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated average relative standard errors of the preliminary data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. Changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show irregular movement. It takes 4 months to establish a trend for new houses sold. Preliminary new home sales figures are subject to revision due to the survey methodology and definitions used. The survey is primarily based on a sample of houses selected from building permits. Since a ""sale"" is defined as a deposit taken or sales agreement signed, this can occur prior to a permit being issued. An estimate of these prior sales is included in the sales figure. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimate of total sales is revised about 4.6 percent. Changes in sales price data reflect changes in the distribution of houses by region, size, etc., as well as changes in the prices of houses with identical characteristics.

12/01/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-196.cfm,HUD Awards $41 Million in HOPWA Grants to Provide Housing to Low-Income Persons Living with HIV and Their Families,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Office of HIV/AIDS Housing today announced it will award $41 million in Housing Opportunities for Persons With AIDS (HOPWA) competitive grants to 20 local governments and non-profit organizations through the HOPWA: Housing as an Intervention to Fight AIDS funding opportunity.
""The importance of affordable housing and access to inclusive, non-discriminatory supportive services for low-income persons living with HIV/AIDS cannot be understated,"" said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""Housing is a powerful structural intervention in ending the HIV/AIDS epidemic and this funding will provide grantees and their partners the opportunity to make a real impact in their communities.""
In April, HUD announced the HOPWA Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO), which allowed applicants to submit proposals aimed at creating and implementing new projects that align with initiatives to end the HIV/AIDS epidemic and to elevate housing as an effective structural intervention in ending the epidemic.
The HOPWA grants are a part of HUD's mission to providing access to high-quality and culturally competent services, including housing and supportive services that are non-stigmatizing, non-discriminatory, inclusive, and responsive to the needs of persons living with HIV/AIDS. Housing instability has been a major issue facing many persons living with HIV since the beginning of the epidemic.
Approximately half of all persons living with HIV in the U.S. will experience homelessness or housing instability at some point following their diagnosis. Economic disadvantages, episodes of poor health, and co-occurring health diagnoses make it difficult for many persons living with HIV to secure or maintain housing. Additionally, HIV/AIDS-related stigma, discrimination and systemic racism contribute to differences in access to housing and lead to ongoing disparities among racial, ethnic, and LGBTQ+ communities.
The projects awarded today show exemplary and innovative qualities, including community-level coordination, data collection with emphasis on stable housing and positive health outcomes, culturally competent approaches to providing housing and services, and a systemic approach to advance equity in underserved communities that can serve as a national place-based model. The awardees of the HOPWA grants will receive a one-time, non-renewable grant to fund housing assistance and supportive services for eligible beneficiaries, coordination and planning activities, and grants management and administration.

12/01/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-197.cfm,FHA Announces New Single Family Title II Forward and Home Equity Conversion Mortgage Loan Limits for 2022,"WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) on Tuesday announced new loan limits for calendar year 2022 for its Single Family Title II forward and Home Equity Conversion (reverse) Mortgage (HECM) insurance programs. Loan limits for most of the country will increase in the coming year resulting from robust house price appreciation, which is factored into the statutorily mandated calculations FHA uses as part of its methodology for determining the limits each year. The new loan limits are effective for FHA case numbers assigned on or after January 1, 2022.

• Read FHA's Mortgagee Letter on 2022 Forward Mortgage Limits.
• Read FHA's Mortgagee Letter on 2022 Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) Limits.
""The increase in loan limits, commensurate with the increase in home prices, will allow qualified individuals and families to continue to access FHA-insured mortgages to achieve affordable home financing,"" said Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Housing and FHA Lopa Kolluri.
FHA is required by the National Housing Act (NHA), as amended by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA), to set Single Family forward mortgage loan limits at 115 percent of area median house prices, subject to a floor and a ceiling on the limits. In accordance with the NHA, FHA calculates forward mortgage limits by Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) and county.
The NHA requires FHA to establish its floor and ceiling loan limits based on the loan limit set by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) for conventional mortgages owned or guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The national conforming loan limit for 2022 is $647,200. FHA's 2022 minimum national loan limit ""floor"", of $420,680 is set at 65 percent of the national conforming loan limit. This ""floor"" applies to those areas where 115 percent of the median home price is less than the ""floor"" limit. Any area where the loan limit exceeds this ""floor"" is considered a high-cost area, and the NHA requires FHA to set its maximum loan limit ""ceiling"" for high-cost areas at $970,800, which is 150 percent of the national conforming loan limit.
Due to robust increases in median housing prices and required changes to FHA's floor and ceiling limits, which are tied to the FHFA's increase in the conventional mortgage loan limit for 2022, the maximum loan limits for FHA forward mortgages will rise in 3,188 counties. In 45 counties, FHA's loan limits will remain unchanged. By statute, the median home price for an MSA is based on the county within the MSA which has the highest median price.
Additionally, the FHA-insured HECM maximum claim amount will increase to $970,800 from $822,375 for calendar year 2022. FHA's current HECM regulations do not allow the HECM limit to vary by MSA or county; instead, the single HECM limit applies to all HECMs regardless of where the property is located.
To find a complete list of FHA loan limits, areas at the FHA ceiling, and areas between the floor and the ceiling, visit FHA's Loan Limits Page."
12/02/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-199.cfm,HUD Makes Additional $5.7 Million in American Rescue Plan Funds Available to Fight Housing Discrimination Related to the Coronavirus Pandemic,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is making an additional $5,757,663 in American Rescue Plan (ARP) funding available to help HUD Fair Housing Initiatives Program (FHIP) agencies combat housing discrimination related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Organizations that qualify for the funding, which is being awarded through FHIP's Private Enforcement Initiative (PEI) component, will be able to use the money to conduct a range of fair housing enforcement and education and outreach activities, including addressing discriminatory practices in underserved communities.
The funds constitute the second round of ARP funding this year that targets COVID-19 related discrimination. Last month HUD awarded $13.6 million in initial ARP funding to 51 FHIP agencies working to address the unequal impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on communities of color, low-income communities, and other vulnerable populations.
""Unlawful treatment associated with COVID-19 robs families of housing security at a time when they need it the most,"" said Demetria McCain, HUD's Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""The additional ARP funds we're making available today will provide more of our fair housing partners the financial resources they need to oppose discriminatory policies and practices.""
In addition to enforcement and education and outreach activities, the funding can be used to respond to housing inquiries, conduct fair housing testing, provide legal assistance, and cover costs associated with providing services related to the pandemic.
Applicants who are interested in applying for funding should go to www.Grants.gov to obtain a copy of the specific Notice of Funding Opportunity, forms, instructions, and other application materials. Additional information can be found on HUD's website, www.hud.gov.
Applications must be received by December 30, 2021.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 877-8339 (Relay). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to www.hud.gov/fairhousing."
12/07/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-200.cfm,HUD Announces more than $52 Million to Deliver Equitable COVID-19 Relief to Tribal Communities,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced the awarding of more than $52 million in Indian Community Block Grant-American Rescue Plan (ICDBG-ARP) grants to 49 Tribal communities to prevent, prepare for, and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. The announcement, made by HUD Deputy Secretary Todman during a speaking engagement at the National American Indian Housing Council's Legal Symposium, underscores the Biden-Harris Administration's commitment to delivering equitable COVID-19 relief to Tribal communities.
A breakdown of the awards by recipient is available here.
These funds to Tribes will help protect the health and safety of their communities, particularly low- and moderate-income individuals and families, by expanding access to safe housing, a suitable living environment, and economic opportunities.
""I'm pleased to announce these robust resources for Tribal communities to meet urgent housing, community, and economic development needs,"" said HUD Deputy Secretary Adrianne Todman. ""The funding HUD is awarding today will support our mission to ensure that every person has the security of a healthy, safe, and resilient home and community. HUD looks forward to ongoing partnerships with Tribal communities to expand equity and opportunity and strengthen nation-to-nation relationships.""
Today's announcement follows HUD's awarding of $74 million in ICDBG-ARP grants to 68 Tribal communities in November. The American Rescue Plan included a total of $280 million for the Indian Community Development Block Grant program; HUD will announce additional ICDBG-ARP awards on a rolling basis.
The Department and the Biden-Harris Administration have made delivering equitable COVID-19 relief to Tribal communities a priority. The American Rescue Plan Act provides a total of $750 million dollars in HUD resources to Indian Country to support the continued fight against COVID-19. Earlier this year, HUD made a historic $450 million investment in Indian Housing Block Grants (IHBG-ARP) to Indian tribes across the country to respond to COVID-19. The Department also invested $5 million in COVID-19 relief for Native Hawaiians.
HUD and the Biden-Harris Administration remain committed to meeting and prioritizing the needs of Native communities."
12/08/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-201.cfm,"HHS and HUD Announce Expanded Partnership, New Housing and Services Resource Center","Today, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (https://hhs.gov/) (HHS) and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced the expansion of a partnership (https://acl.gov/sites/default/files/ada/HHS-HUD_HousingFactSheetpdf.pdf) established earlier this year to improve access to affordable, accessible housing and the critical services that make community living possible. The partners also announced the launch of a national Housing and Services Resource Center (HSRC) as the hub of this coordinated federal effort. Today's announcement builds on President Biden's Executive Order (www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-advancing-racial-equity-and-support-for-underserved-communities-through-the-federal-government/) establishing a government-wide commitment to advancing equity, including for people with disabilities, as well as additional commitments (www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/26/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-marks-anniversary-of-americans-with-disabilities-act-and-announces-resources-to-support-individuals-with-long-covid/) announced in July on the anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act.
Within HHS, this partnership is led by the Administration for Community Living (https://acl.gov/). It includes the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (www.cms.gov/), the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (www.samhsa.gov/), and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (https://aspe.hhs.gov/).
Many people with disabilities, older adults, and people experiencing homelessness need help obtaining housing that is both affordable and accessible. Many also need access to community-based supportive services - such as behavioral health services, personal care assistance, tenancy supports, accessible transportation, and home-delivered meals - in order to live successfully and stably in the community. Without housing and services that meets their needs, they are often left with no choice but to live in facilities, like nursing homes and homeless shelters, or on the streets.
In every state and community, there are a number of entities and programs helping people access housing and supportive services. Too often, however, the housing and service systems are siloed. On the other hand, stronger collaboration between these systems would enable states and communities to coordinate resources to help older adults, people with disabilities and people experiencing homelessness achieve housing stability, live with dignity and independence in the community, and avoiding homelessness and costly institutional care.
""COVID-19 has been particularly devastating for people who live in nursing homes and other congregate settings. Expanding community living options is critical to advancing health equity,"" said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra. ""That's why the Biden-Harris Administration is investing more today in home and community-based services, behavioral health, and affordable and accessible housing. Our partnership with HHS and HUD comes at a pivotal moment, and we're going to keep up the pace as we help communities build back better.""
""Many communities across the country are seeing growing numbers of people with disabilities and older adults experiencing homelessness. Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, HUD is able to provide communities with historic new housing resources needed to bring many more people experiencing homelessness off the streets and out of shelters and into permanent homes,"" said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""This new joint HHS and HUD center will help communities break down the silos and coordinate the provision of services with housing to ensure that these new resources reach our most vulnerable homeless neighbors.""
The Housing and Services Resource Center (https://acl.gov/HousingAndServices) will implement a federally coordinated approach to providing resources, program guidance, training, and technical assistance to public housing authorities and housing providers; state Medicaid, disability, aging and behavioral health agencies; the aging and disability networks; homeless services organizations and networks; health care systems and providers; and tribal organizations.
The Housing and Services Resource Center also aims to facilitate state and local partnerships between housing and service systems and assist communities in leveraging new housing and service resources available through the American Rescue Plan and, when it passes, through the Build Back Better Act.
The Housing and Services Resource Center website brings together -- for the first time -- a wide variety of federal resources and guidance on both housing and services that support community living, including Medicaid-funded home and community-based services, behavioral health supports, vouchers, and other housing programs. The HSRC website also provides information about the organizations in the respective networks and examples of successful partnerships and strategies for more effectively and efficiently connecting people to affordable, accessible housing and the services provided in the home or community to support independent living. Through the Housing and Services Resource Center, HHS and HUD will offer webinars, develop and disseminate new technical assistance resources, facilitate peer-to-peer learning and launch a learning collaborative."

Collectively, these organizations successfully won bids on 814 mortgage notes - the entire volume of notes eligible for priority bidding.
Consistent with the Biden-Harris Administration's September 1, 2021, announcement (www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/09/01/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-immediate-steps-to-increase-affordable-housing-supply/) that more HUD-owned properties should be returned to future owner-occupancy, HUD offered up to 50 percent of the notes in the multi-loan pools for bids first by eligible non-profit organizations and units of state and local government. Previous sales prioritized approximately 10 percent of the mortgage notes for this purpose.
""The success of this sale is the foundation upon which we will continue to build on this Administration's efforts to provide more opportunities for affordable homeownership and neighborhood revitalization,"" said Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Housing Lopa P. Kolluri. ""We had a record number of interested non-profit organizations who participated in this most recent sale, and we look forward to providing more note sale opportunities for non-profit organizations going forward.""
The goal of the sale was to sell mortgage notes that have gone through foreclosure or deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure to purchasers whose mission is to increase affordable housing, expand opportunities for homeownership and rental housing, and revitalize communities by:
Selling properties to low- to moderate-income homebuyers at a price affordable to households earning less than 120 percent of the Area Family Income; and Leasing properties at rents affordable to households earning less than or equal to 80 percent of the American Median Family Income.
• Selling properties to low- to moderate-income homebuyers at a price affordable to households earning less than 120 percent of the Area Family Income; and
• Leasing properties at rents affordable to households earning less than or equal to 80 percent of the American Median Family Income.
HUD's Office of Asset Sales is part of the Office of Finance and Budget in HUD's Office of Housing. Multi-loan pools of mortgage notes sold through the December 1, 2021, sale were secured by vacant and abandoned properties secured by Home Equity Conversion Mortgages assigned to HUD following the death of the borrower and any non-borrowing spouse where the time for heirs to come forward has elapsed.

The grants announced today emphasize the Biden-Harris Administration's commitment to solving the nation's lead crisis.
HUD is providing these grants through its Lead Based Paint Hazard Reduction (LBPHR) Grant Programs to identify and clean up dangerous lead, and health and safety hazards in low-income families' homes. These grants also include nearly $1.3 million from HUD's Healthy Homes Supplemental funding to help communities with housing-related health and safety hazards in addition to lead-based paint hazards.
These investments will protect families and children by targeting significant lead and health hazards in over 600 low-income homes for which other resources are not available.
""The funds awarded through the Lead Based Paint Hazard Reduction Grant Programs are critical for communities to mitigate the impacts of unhealthy housing, preserve affordable housing, and ensure that future generations can reach their full potential,"" said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""These grants will enable families to live in homes that are healthier as a result of our, and their city governments' efforts.""
The grants announced today are the second round of grants this year from the Lead Based Paint Hazard Reduction Grant Program and come as a part of HUD's continued efforts to solve the nations lead crisis. In August, HUD awarded nearly $95 million to 28 state and local government agencies in 19 states to protect children and families from lead-based paint and other home health hazards.
This past October, Secretary Fudge hosted Cleveland Clinic President and CEO, Dr. Tom Mihaljevic, to discuss the nation's lead poisoning crisis and to raise awareness of the harmful and long-term effects of lead exposure to children, particularly the disproportional prevalence of elevated blood levels in underserved and communities of color."

12/22/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-211.cfm,FACT SHEET: 2021 HUD Year in Review,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) this year took bold action in pursuit of the agency's mission to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes. These actions aligned with key Biden-Harris Administration priorities including ensuring equity, removing barriers to homeownership, expanding the nation's housing supply, and keeping Americans housed.
Below are highlights of some of the agency's actions from 2021.
Launched a Whole-of-government Effort to Ensure All Americans Are Treated Fairly in the Home Appraisals Process. On June 1, President Biden tasked Secretary Fudge with leading a first-of-its-kind interagency initiative to address inequity in home appraisals. In partnership with the Domestic Policy Council, HUD created the Property Appraisal and Valuation Equity (PAVE) Task Force, bringing together 15 federal agencies to identify and utilize all levers at their disposal to root out discrimination in the appraisal and homebuying process. The Task Force has been exploring the extent, causes, and impacts of misvaluation faced by communities of color, gathering input from industry, advocates, and other stakeholders, and developing new policy approaches around guidance and enforcement. This work will be presented to the President and the public early next year, documenting the scope of the problem and providing detailed, actionable agency commitments and recommendations for next steps.
Launched All-Hands-on-Deck Effort to Address Homelessness Crisis. On September 20, Secretary Fudge launched House America, a national partnership with other Administration officials, mayors, county officials, governors, and tribal nation leaders across the nation. The plan works with those leaders to use American Rescue Plan (ARP) resources to re-house at least 100,000 people experiencing homelessness and add at least 20,000 new affordable and permanent supportive housing units to address homelessness into the development pipeline by the end of 2022.
Eviction And Foreclosure Prevention. HUD helped prevent eviction of HUD-assisted households and stabilize families struggling because of the COVID-19 pandemic by deploying the historic funding made available under the Consolidated Appropriations Act and ARP to help keep families stably housed. HUD worked closely with the White House and the Treasury Department, providing the Department's expertise to help FAQs and best practices for the Emergency Rental Assistance Program. HUD also helped homeowners who may have been behind on their mortgages stay in their homes and worked with Treasury to engage stakeholders around the utilization of the Homeowner Assistance Fund and its integration with new policies released by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) to help struggling homeowners keep their homes.
Stood Up a New $5 Billion HOME-ARP Program to Assist Some of The Country's Most Vulnerable Populations. HUD successfully stood up a brand new $5 billion program to assist some of the country's most vulnerable populations including individuals or households who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. The Office of Community Planning and Development has made funding available to 651 state and local governments, which will be used to reduce homelessness and increase housing stability by providing funding for rental housing development, acquisition and development of non-congregate shelter, tenant-based rental assistance, and supportive services. HUD released a portion of grantee administrative funds at the outset of the program to better support the planning activities that lead to effective use of grant funding.
Removed Barriers to Homeownership for Those with Student Loan Debt. The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) updated its policy on student loan monthly payment calculations to remove barriers and provide more access to affordable single-family FHA-insured mortgage financing for creditworthy individuals with student loan debt, which has disproportionate impact on communities of color. The updates removed the previous requirement that lenders calculate a borrower's student loan monthly payment of one percent of the outstanding student loan balance for student loans that are not fully amortizing. The new policy bases the monthly payment on the actual student loan payment, more closely aligning FHA policies with industry standards.
Set the Stage for Increased Fair Housing and Lending Enforcement and Access. HUD signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) to kick off a historic collaboration on fair housing and fair lending enforcement and oversight engagement with the FHFA-regulated entities including Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Banks. This comprehensive effort will ensure deeper collaboration on fair housing investigations and enable data sharing to help strengthen and affirmatively further fair housing for the mortgage industry. In addition, HUD Published a legal memorandum making it clear that certain Special Purpose Credit Programs (SPCPs) that are lawful under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) generally are not barred by the Fair Housing Act, allowing their use by lenders to expand access to credit in underserved communities.
Took Action to Increase Housing Supply and Access to Affordable Housing. HUD restarted its Housing Finance Agency (HFA) risk-sharing program with Treasury's Federal Financing Bank (FFB) on September 1 to develop more affordable rental homes. The program allows HFAs to obtain FHA insurance on multifamily mortgages they underwrite, with HUD and the HFA sharing the risk of any potential loss. FHA anticipates that approximately 20,000 affordable rental homes will be created or preserved through the program through 2027. HUD also made more single-family homes available to individuals, families, and non-profit organizations - rather than large investors - by prioritizing homeownership and limiting sale to large investors of certain FHA-insured and HUD-owned properties. HUD also released new research on actions that state and local governments can take to increase their housing supply and is developing a Housing Supply Toolkit filled with easy-to-implement strategies for grantees to deploy HUD resources to address supply and affordability challenges that have been deepened by the pandemic.
Restored the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing (AFFH) Requirement. The Department published an interim final rule (IFR) that went into effect on July 31st to restore the implementation of the Fair Housing Act's AFFH requirement. Under the restored AFFH regulatory definition in the IFR, HUD funding recipients must regularly certify compliance with the Fair Housing Act's AFFH requirement and commit to taking steps to remedy their fair housing issues in making such certifications. The IFR helps HUD, 3,747 public housing authorities, and 1,200 state and local government grantees in the CDBG, HOME, and HOPWA programs fulfill their AFFH obligations under the Fair Housing Act.
Historically Strong Mutual Mortgage Insurance (MMI) Fund. HUD announced a historically strong Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund Report showing that, in addition to its emphasis on delivering relief options to homeowners financially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, FHA continued to deliver on its mission of enabling homeownership for first-time and low- and moderate-income, and households of color. The Fund remains well positioned to withstand future economic events and endure the outcomes from the pandemic-induced delinquencies that remain in forbearance or are seriously delinquent. The percentage of first-time homebuyers using FHA insurance reached a new high, the share of mortgages insured by FHA to minority borrowers reached almost 42 percent of all FHA forward mortgage insurance endorsements. FHA served double the percentage of Black and Hispanic borrowers when compared to those served through mortgage originations by the rest of the housing market this past fiscal year.
Protected the LGBTQ+ Community from Housing Discrimination. On February 11th, HUD announced that it would interpret the Fair Housing Act to bar discrimination on the bases of sexual orientation and gender identity, consistent with President Biden's Executive Order 13988 and the Supreme Court's ruling in Bostock v. Clayton County. This decision has expanded the protections of the Fair Housing Act to a community that has historically been subject to discrimination. Through its partner FHIPs and FHAPs agencies, HUD has processed 235 cases alleging sex discrimination due to gender identity and sexual orientation last year, nearly twice as many cases than last year.
Developed and Released HUD's Climate Action Plan. On November 11th, HUD released a comprehensive, Agency-wide Climate Action Plan, which details a strategy to reduce the agency's energy and carbon footprint and put our nation's communities on the path to building more equitable, efficient, and sustainable housing infrastructure. The Climate Action Plan was developed in response to President Biden's Executive Order on Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad (www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/27/executive-order-on-tackling-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad/). In keeping with the executive order, as well as the President's Justice40 Initiative (www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/01/27/fact-sheet-president-biden-takes-executive-actions-to-tackle-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad-create-jobs-and-restore-scientific-integrity-across-federal-government/)to advance environmental justice and racial equity, HUD will implement a broad approach to the climate crisis that reduces climate pollution; increases resilience to the impacts of climate change; protects public health; delivers environmental justice; and spurs well-paying union jobs and economic growth.
Helped Communities Rebuild from Disasters. In November, HUD announced the allocation of more than $2 billion in disaster funding for communities in 10 states covering 15 major disasters—including wildfires in California, hurricanes in Louisiana, and earthquakes in Puerto Rico. And we will keep working with our partners to deliver relief for other communities rebuilding in the wake of natural disasters—including tornado victims in Kentucky. Additionally, HUD has taken meaningful action to reset its relationship with Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands and to address ongoing recovery and resilience needs. This includes obligating long-awaited disaster recovery funds and removing onerous restrictions placed on the grants, such as incremental grant obligations, Federal Financial Monitor review, and more. Now, ninety percent of promised funds have been obligated to Puerto Rico, an increase of $16B since the start of the Administration."
12/22/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-212.cfm,HUD Announces Waivers to Help Kentucky Communities Recover from Severe Weather,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced a package of regulatory and administrative waivers aimed at helping communities in Kentucky accelerate their recovery from tornadoes and severe storms that occurred on December 12, 2021.
""HUD continues to enable swift response to these storms"" said Deputy Assistant Secretary for Grant Programs Kevin Bush. ""With these waivers, we are giving our state and local partners in Kentucky the flexibility they need to more expeditiously respond to the needs of low- and moderate-income disaster survivors and rebuild from these severe storms and tornadoes.""
The regulatory and administrative relief announced today covers the following HUD programs: The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program, HOME Investment Partnerships (HOME) Program, Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) Program, Continuum of Care (CoC) Program, and Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG) Program. To expedite the use of these funds, HUD's state and local partners can now access a waiver through a new simplified notification process. HUD's flexibilities include:
These severe storms disrupted communications networks. Therefore, HUD is waiving the normal communication requirements and allowing these grantees to determine what constitutes reasonable notice and opportunity to comment. These storms caused extensive damage and destruction to the housing stock in certain impacted areas. To accelerate new housing construction, HUD is suspending normal rules to enable CDBG grantees to replace affordable housing units that were lost as a result of severe weather. HUD recognizes that affected citizens may require additional time and effort to execute their recovery plans. Consequently, HUD will suspend a cap limiting CDBG expenditures for public services to 15 percent. HUD will temporarily allow CDBG grantees to pay for additional support services for individuals and families affected by severe weather. Services could include, but not be limited to, the provision of food, emergency shelter, case management and related services to help residents in declared-disaster areas until long-term recovery resources become available.

EXPLANATORY NOTES
These statistics are estimated from sample surveys. They are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated average relative standard errors of the preliminary data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. Changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show irregular movement. It takes 4 months to establish a trend for new houses sold. Preliminary new home sales figures are subject to revision due to the survey methodology and definitions used. The survey is primarily based on a sample of houses selected from building permits. Since a “sale” is defined as a deposit taken or sales agreement signed, this can occur prior to a permit being issued. An estimate of these prior sales is included in the sales figure. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimate of total sales is revised about 4.6 percent. Changes in sales price data reflect changes in the distribution of houses by region, size, etc., as well as changes in the prices of houses with identical characteristics. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the (www.census.gov/construction/nrs/how_the_data_are_collected/index.html).
* The 90 percent confidence interval includes zero. In such cases, there is insufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero."
12/28/2021:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2021/pr21-215.cfm,HUD Reaches Settlement with Southern California Housing Providers Resolving Claims of National Origin Discrimination,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has reached a Conciliation/Voluntary Compliance Agreement with National Community Renaissance, National Community Renaissance of California, Desert Meadows Housing Partners, LP, Victorville Housing Partners L.P., and Cathedral Family Housing Partners, L.P., management agents and owners of four HUD-subsidized apartment complexes in southern California, resolving allegations that the property managers refused to rent to or provide adequate language services for applicants with limited English proficiency (LEP). This conciliation/voluntary compliance agreement does not constitute an admission by Respondents or evidence of a determination by HUD of any violation of the Fair Housing Act or any other law. Read the agreement.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from discriminating against persons seeking housing because of national origin. In addition, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of national origin by recipients of federal financial assistance and requires such recipients to take reasonable steps to ensure that LEP persons have meaningful access to programs and activities.
""We are pleased the parties were able to resolve the matter,"" said Demetria L. McCain, HUD's Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD remains committed to assisting protected class members, including non-English speakers, with their housing concerns.""
The case came to HUD's attention when Inland Fair Housing and Mediation Board (IFHMB), a HUD Fair Housing Initiatives Program agency, filed four complaints after it conducted fair housing tests allegedly showing that on-site managers at the properties refused to rent to LEP persons and told Spanish speaking prospective tenants that they needed to speak English in order to be added to properties' waiting lists. LEP prospective tenants were also allegedly told that they had to provide their own interpreters. The respondents denied the allegations but voluntarily agreed to settle the matter.
Under the Agreement, the management agents and owners of the properties will pay $9,000 to IFHMB, submit documentation attesting to completion of fair housing training, and comply with HUD's LEP Guidelines entitled ""Final Guidance to Federal Financial Assistance Recipients Regarding Title VI Prohibition Against National Origin Discrimination Affecting Limited English Proficient Persons.""
People who believe they have experienced discrimination in housing may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 877-8339 (Relay). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to hud.gov/fairhousing."
